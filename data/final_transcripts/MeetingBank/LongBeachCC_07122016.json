Many of you have come before this council and know that this council is extremely committed to raising the minimum wage. In fact, we have always been committed to that, and we're on a path and are on a responsible path.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we can differ on that, but I don't believe there is any one. We are committed to that. I made the motion earlier thinking and believing that a meeting confer process had not been scheduled and that that we were running out of time so that we had to adopt this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you have graciously agreed to commit to a meet and confer process within 30 days. And I think it would behoove us if we can put this off until then and let the council vote on that. And I'm willing to change my motion to reflect that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And then I'll come back and have to have this discussion out there.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'This is going to come back, I promise. We have an opportunity to speak again. I'm also trying my very best, you know, the woman at the end who's been always the one to bring up living wages and support for workers and progressive issues, is being honored tonight by the LGBTQ community, and they're waiting for her to do'",
        "'speaker_1': 'something very special for her. And so I'm also hoping to to be able to give her that support. And so this will come back in 30 days, if there's any. Is there any public comment on the new motion?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just the new motion to give which which allows the I am more time to be confirmed. That's the motion, the seeing nonmembers. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'You taking over?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Go to see it all evening. To be able to speak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. They had been.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Allowed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think he must come up. The motions were made in. The motions were passed. And so. Thank you. Next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, no, no. I'm not going to take comment from the audience this way. And so hold on a second. That's not the way it works. I actually just asked well, I ask, is there any public comment on the new motion before us?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't see anyone. So yeah, if you wanted to speak on it, absolutely can speak. But nobody said anything when I said, Are there any of the comments on the new motion? So please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think. What? Hi, my name is Gary Hetrick. I reside in the fourth district. I think I think the what what we're trying to articulate here is that that the issues that we want to talk about, I think, are important for the council to hear as you deliberate over the next 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And some of the things that that I wanted to raise and I think others want to raise, too, is certainly the wage theft is a huge issue. I mean, we can raise the minimum wage to $30 an hour, but if people aren't being paid, it doesn't matter where that number is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other thing that I wanted to speak on I think is important is is this on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That earnings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Training wage. And I think this opens up the possibility for a great deal of. Well, it's it's a loophole. It allows employers in many industries to pay subminimum wages and get away with it for 480 hours. And that's that's a that's a huge now at six months and no other major city has that maximum.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to have a cap. We need to have an age cap and we need to have a lower minimum that's consistent with other cities like Santa monica and Pasadena. It's you know, I also teach at I'm with the with the the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in Health Community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm also a social geographer at Cal State Long Beach. And I have a lot of students who are trying to go to school and and make enough money to do that without going further into debt. So I think the minimum wage is certainly important, but we need to have these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Other conversations as part of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Wage. That is certainly part of it. But also having a cap, an age cap, but also having a a lower number of, of, of hours attached to the, um, the training wage I'd like to see gotten rid of altogether.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's up to you. But I think it needs to be taken very seriously. Thank you, Mayor Garcia, for allowing me to speak.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much. Next media.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. My name is Alex Monahan, SS with the Filipino Migrant Center. I live at 2510 Magnolia Avenue. So the Filipino Migrant Center believes that raising the minimum wage in the city of Long Beach was won by hardworking residents, workers, community leaders and organizations who know firsthand the impacts of economic insecurity, unjust pay and inhumane working conditions'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are to the health and lives of children and families. A family's quality of life is directly linked to their economic standing. This victory belongs to them, and we want to make sure that it's not a policy passed only on paper, but implemented in reality.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The Coalition to End Wage Theft in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have been outspoken about the widespread problem of wage theft. Existing labor laws. That are meant to protect workers are being circumvented and ignored by many employers every day. Violating employers are not afraid to break the laws because the laws are not strong enough to hold them accountable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which is why we want to reemphasize to you the value of a local wage enforcement program and push you to invest in community partnerships because we are critical to making enforcement work. Community groups are already doing the work on the ground and are ready to work with you to solve this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need properly funded community contracts to identify wage theft cases, to outreach to and educate workers and their community and to prepare evidence. San Jose is an example of what happens without investment in community contracts. Over the course of two years, even with 4.5 investigators, there were only eight valid claims.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Community organizations are usually the ones hard at work, making sure that the local, state and national laws which serve to improve the lives of thousands of working families are enforced and that these same families understand how to advocate for their rights.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's very critical that we have local wage enforcement. For example, if we wait for the state wage enforcement, if you look at the numbers, even from the California Department of Labor from 2008 to 2011, there were over $31 million in unpaid judgments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That basically means that these were people who won their wage cases, but over 31 million was still not paid to them. That's how long it takes if we wait for state wage enforcement, which is why we need local wage enforcement now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we urge you to take wage enforcement seriously in the same way you treat other forms of crimes that violate human rights of people and most importantly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Invest in our community. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello. My name is John Albury and I come here representing an organization called Gabrielle Los Angeles.

        "'speaker_10': 'and legal support to enforce the minimum wage. I'm here today. Earlier today, we heard a lot of speakers talk about violence in our communities. And I want to say that poverty and economic inequality is directly related to the violence that we experience in these communities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Poverty does not cause violence, but it creates the conditions that fosters it. So it is important to recognize that police violence and wage theft have something in common. They target the most vulnerable segments of our population. They target people of color, low wage workers, immigrants and women.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's important that we are we we take our part in breaking the cycle of poverty that impacts these people as I'm representing them. Gabrielle I'm here today because many of my many of the members of this organization have experienced firsthand what it is to suffer as a result of earning poverty wages and having to take a'",

        "'speaker_10': 'to get paid, and being afraid of losing your job if you speak out once again, poverty does not cause violence, but it creates the conditions that foster it. Violence is a poverty form of violence. When you work in a job with poor labor standards like legal protections and face retaliation from their employers for speaking out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And why do these unjust labor practices persist? They persist because of practices, policies and policies that perpetuate and maintain this system of inequality, economic inequality and lack of wage enforcement. So that's why I'm here today to say, share with you all that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I hope that you choose the solution that that that's that addresses these issues of wage theft and ensures that people are able to to have their rights honored and and ends and protected. There has been a lot of proof that it's this works.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you look at San Francisco they recover 90.5% of the wages and interest owe to workers compared to 48% which was recovered by the state. And strong enforcement itself pays for itself. San Francisco recovered nearly 375,000 in penalties between 2010 and 2015.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'By proposing to pay new workers only 85% of the minimum wage for the first 480 hours. They work in an industry. You're proposing a legalized form of wage theft. That means for every $100 that is earned, $15 will be stolen from paychecks for their first six months on the job and 160 hours and which means two months'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is just as bad. With all due respect, let me ask you all, would you agree to receiving only 85% of what you earn for your first six months as a city council member or as city staff or as the mayor?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because good leaders would not subject people to anything they wouldn't do themselves. But what you're proposing will subject the people of Long Beach to a vicious cycle of unstable employment and exploitation. It will create a loophole for businesses to only hire new workers, squeeze out profit from them for six months, and discard and replace them with another'",
        "'speaker_6': 'underpaid new worker. The youth, immigrants and formerly incarcerated will be the most affected. The learners wage will not only disadvantage Long Beach workers, but it will also disadvantage responsible local businesses that offer long term employment to the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Meanwhile, will benefit big chain retail and fast food employers that have a high turnover staffing model. And it'll force more Long Beach businesses to adopt this model as well just to compete. Is this what you want the future of Long Beach to look like?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is this something you want to add to your legacy when you all voted to raise the minimum wage in January? The working people of Long Beach, rejoiced by the inclusion of this provision, will essentially negate any increase for future workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On behalf of the Filipino community, the youth and working families in Long Beach, I implore you to completely remove the learner's wage provision which would only mar this audience. Ordinance is also imperative. That you fund a local wage enforcement office so that this new minimum wage ordinance will have teeth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To make sure that employers abide by it. Otherwise. Workers will be stuck in the status quo of stolen wages and waiting 1 to 2 years of bureaucracy, waiting through 1 to 2 years of bureaucracy in the California Department of Labor Standards Enforcement for wage claims they may never see.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'companies that have misclassified their drivers as independent contractors. And I'm here to make a very simple point. The point is that if at any point in discussing enforcement of the minimum wage law, there is a temptation to rely on the existing structures that are provided by, say, the California labor commissioner.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Don't. Before I took on this position, I was a legal aid attorney. I ran a wage clinic. I saw thousands of drivers every year. Sorry, thousands of workers every year. From all industries. And what was abundantly clear. Was that?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Not just for wage theft in general. But for workers who are misclassified. So first, the logistics. I estimate that it usually takes anywhere from a year and a half to two years for a claim to make its way through the through the Labor Commissioner's office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's an incredible amount of time. Moreover. Many cases that make it all the way through and result in judgments. Never see a dime. There have been studies on this by the UCLA Labor Center. In other words, the Labor Commissioner process.'",
