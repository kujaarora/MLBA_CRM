        "'speaker_3': 'It was a game changer for those especially seeking employment from the disability community. And it was it was a game changer in the sense that we were now required to put a statement under every job announcement that we had to be ADA compliant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's very important. It was a game changer for not only the city, but for the U.S. in general, for the country in terms of employment, for those with disabilities. So I would go to the ADA, I would go to Cape Cod meetings and talk about what were the employment opportunities that were existing then in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city and encouraged people to apply. And I think that we have a nice representative sample of people who have been applying for jobs with a similar language that we've hired. It wasn't easy because there are still people out there who feel that if you have any kind of disability, you're not eligible to apply for employment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we know that that is wrong and that and that it's mistake. It's a mistaken belief that people with any kind of disability cannot do a job. I have a disability, if you want to call it that. I'm colorblind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would never be a police officer. I would never be a firefighter because my color blindness blindness keeps me from recognizing a red wire from a green wire, the regular color blind or what color of the vehicle was it and what was what was that perpetrator wearing in terms of color?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are some jobs that can be restricted, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't be a good employee for the police department. So let's keep that in mind that there are all the alternatives and there are other ways to get jobs.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Everything from digital inclusion to black health equity to children and families and diapers and supporting communities most in need, access to food in individuals experiencing homelessness with shelter, and just a number of really amazing things. And so this council did approve the Recovery Act.'",

It was a came together very quickly as an initial plan in focusing on economic recovery, health and safe community and securing our city's future. I won't go through all the the buckets because the mayor did that very well.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'are what we prefer who provide the services to our communities, and we would have to be having those discussions. And, you know, we are still going to have to have some budget balancing discussions and options and look at that for the next year and that there will be some service reductions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we have a year to plan and we really still are looking at some of the strategic investments as well, so that we have to look to the future over this next year to figure out how we're going to address some of those future challenges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the funding for the Recovery Act comes from federal, state and county grants. It is actually up now. So we increased it was originally a $235 million plan that the council acted on in March. It's up it's 249 million since approved by the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've added a number of different areas, but at the same time, the biggest bucket of money, which is the money that we have the most discretion on from the federal government, actually went down. It went down about $17.9 million when we got our final allocation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we did have to make some adjustments. We went through a methodology to essentially protect all of the programs that the council approved, but programs under 300,000, those were real small. We did not take any reductions in those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We because any percent reduction there would be pretty impactful from 300000 to 2 million, we reduced those by 10% and programs over 2 million. We reduced by 20% so that we didn't take it all out of the programing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were able to identify about $6.5 million in the reserves category that due to financial projections, maybe did a little bit better. And we didn't need that $6.5 million as urgently. And the Recovery Act, just as you know, is 249 million is larger than some of the entire budgets of some of our other cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that does require a lot of management, a lot of staffing to make sure that we're doing it appropriately and spending it effectively. We are proposing a three year staffing and administration plan to be able to incorporate into each one of those funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we also have some reporting requirements to the federal government and sort of minimize audit issues to keep the dollars as flexible as possible. We're using what's called the indirect funding option for ARPA. And so we're essentially attributing ARPA to revenue loss, which allows us to invest these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But then we're also creating a very strict plan to be able to show that all of these programs line up with the original intent of the federal government. The framework for reconciliation is a big part of our budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On August 11, 2020, we adopted that plan. There's been a number of actions that have occurred, and we're going to be coming back in August with a larger report on the one year anniversary of that work. The Office of Equity has moved to the city manager's office and has really been a liaison to all the different departments'",
        "'speaker_7': '. We've increased capacity with two positions. We have equity champions in each department. We've implemented racial equity one on one trainings. And a real big part of our response to COVID this year was our Vaccine Equity and Outreach Subcommittee that worked with the community providing vaccine opportunities in the hardest hit neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Recovery Act does support our racial reconciliation plan. We have in that plan youth academic programing at libraries. There is funding for youth life coaching and mentoring, expanding our Be Safe program for parks activities at night, expanding our Long Beach, Activating Safe Communities program that has been working in the Washington neighborhood and expanding that to others in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'high impact communities. Creating a reentry pilot program to reintegrate services for people that are reentering from incarceration, investing in economic empowerment zones, funding for community land trust, research and investment. Strong programs around digital inclusion. Inclusion for businesses and residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A mental health crisis response pilot that's underway and under development. And our youth workforce development programs. Normally we have a long list of some of the new critical investments added. Normally with one time funds or one time funds, we're less this year than they've been in the past, given the the significant fiscal challenges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a smaller list, but here it is. Here they are. We're investing in a diversity recruitment, mentorship and partnership partnership program in the police department, 220,000, which is structurally funded within the police budget for helping the workforce reflect our diverse community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have a similar program in the fire department, 250,001 times, which is continuing that program from last year. We invested 2.18 million and our requirements for elections and redistricting. Those are both charter amendments and have specific timelines and deadlines that need to be funded.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we have a number of commitments from previous years that were planned many years ago to come due in this budget, one of which was our brand new Wrigley greenbelt, which we got funding for, and it's now being implemented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we're launching a large new downtown park, and it'll be completed and opened in 2022. And so that park needs both maintenance and programing. One of the areas for new investment is measure us, and that is a subsection of funding that went to voters and was recommended by the Council to Fund Children and Youth Services, Community'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Health and Climate Change. We're very happy to announce that the Council gave us direction about a youth fund and that's been created as part of the city council or part of the budget to invest in youth and youth services informed by all of our strategic plans, reconciliation and other planning efforts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is a brand new program. So I want to tell the council, we're just starting we're listening to everything that we heard from you and the community. And we made a proposal, but we know this is going to get some adjustment any time you adopt a new program like this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're very open to that. We're flexible to hear the ideas of the community and the council on that. And so the staff proposal is to create a youth fund in the amount of $918,000. That would include $200,000 of direct youth community based grants where they can apply and get funding for the most important things in the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'community. A youth ambassador program where we're hiring youth and training them in our parks, continuing the model from CARES. And then as those youth move on to other opportunities, hiring more youth in their place and having a standard program that can help out in our parks and teach a valuable skills as well to our youth steam and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'ecosystem programing. This is library services programing. We're focusing on science and technology and math and arts, youth mental health programing, continuing the Long Beach Youth Summit every single year, and also funding to communicate all the facts that are happening with our youth and data management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And looking at the plan and supporting that commission, we would fund 155,000 in community health. We have in the past created an older adult program that's been very important to the community. It's always been funded with some one times or something dollars that were available, and this would create actual structural support for the older adult program and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'also support our staffing in our racial equity efforts. And then finally, climate. This is taking pieces of the climate addict adaptation and adaption plan and $243,000 to invest in things like community based organization grants for farms and community gardens and teaching gardens.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would have more field work programs for youth and help to expand our neighborhood tree planting. We had a council item that asked about tree planting throughout the city and how can we enhance our resources. And this would help with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And also creating an electric lawn equipment program. HMD has one and this would be helping supplement that for Long Beach people in need. Measure A continues to provide all the past restorations, public safety, maintenance and administrative support. And we have 2.5 million to be able to keep the budget status quo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And June 17 was funded in 21. It was set to not be funded in 22. And so this would continue. That is as per our our philosophy this year, to keep going for one more year through one time dollars and measuring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have $2.2 million for our Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative in the police department. For a number of years, we've been planning that this year would be the year that measure would support our public safety radio replacement cost. So this is radio communication systems for police and fire that's antiquated and needs to be updated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Supporting community hospital, $4 million and then 20.8 million for infrastructure, which also includes funding our police and fire academy renovations and other infrastructure, as well as a new $4.0 million or $4 million for ADA sidewalk compliance and curb requirements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have a robust capital improvement plan that you are going to have a very specific section on. We'll come to you and deconstruct the CP and talk about all the projects there. It's 470 million. The harbor is a big portion of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the next two biggest categories are utilities and mobility and mobility as all of our street work. And that's $51.8 million for streets and sidewalks. The General Fund is balanced with one times. So it's a balanced budget, but there is a significant amount of one time funding that we need to disclose.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's not a structural solution there and it will need to be addressed in FY 23. So that structural shortfall in 22 for the next year I'm sorry, the original structural shortfall is $27 million for this year and then 3 million in additional one time costs, which is covered by the Recovery Act.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so while this isn't our normal strategy for addressing budgets, this was an amazing, incredible year. And reserves are there for a reason. And and one time dollars have come in to help us. And so that's really why we're recommending the to do this for one year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And also, we know that this budget doesn't support everything. There are a number of things the council asked for, the community asked for that we're underfunded in our departments. We try to disclose the the big items of that in the budget, including all the items that have come from the city council that have some funding or partial'",
        "'speaker_7': 'funding. Those are listed in an attachment with links to the two fund for us for easy reading. So what is our general fund fiscal outlook look like? So in 22 we are balance, but in 23 we have a $9 million surplus, but we have to carry over the shortfall from the previous year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's 27 million. So it's a total of 36, which is a lot. That is a big number. 24 is another $11 million to solve and 25 is another nine. So this also includes that we are expecting some recovery revenue of the next couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we do know that our revenues are just growing slower than our expenses and that fact still remains. We do assume that we're going to win the measure and litigation currently seems likely given that Sacramento won their case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Otherwise, 23 would be about $9 million worth, and it's going to be a high priority in 22, beginning earlier to develop approaches to address that structural shortfall. So we've had a number of meetings already on the budget in March and April and July, and now we really turn to our community budget meetings, the BRC meetings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's it's a proposed budget and it's really in the council's hands. This is one of the most important things the council does every year is consider the manager's budget, look at mayor recommendations, and then listen to the community and make those tough decisions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are many opportunities for community engagement. You can attend budget hearings, attend community budget meetings, attend Bossi meetings. We have our Long Beach survey on funding priorities. And we're also, when we do the outreach, going to be working on the Long Beach strategic plan as well, and engaging residents per the council's request to get additional input on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'our strategic plan. And so I will finish with saying that this is an amazing city. It's a city committed to moving onwards and upwards. We say that a lot here. City of many accomplishments, a full service city, a wide variety of amazing services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We address our challenges head on. We don't shirk from them. We have such committed, dedicated employees who have just done extraordinary work throughout the pandemic to address and recover. And we have very strong leadership from our policymakers, our mayor and city council, and couldn't do this without the support and collaboration of our city auditor, our city attorney'",
        "'speaker_7': ', our prosecutor, our city clerk, our civil service executive director, our harbor executive director and our water general manager. And that concludes the presentation, and we're available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And we are going to go to before I go to the council. I just want to also add that we say every year that this is just the first of these hearings. So there will be opportunities for out throughout the entire budget process where there will be different departments, of course, that will come'",
        "'speaker_0': 'forward and plenty opportunities for questions of specific departments in the future if the council has those. I do have a motion in a second to receive and file for this hearing the report, but I want to I councilman's already mentioned that she wants to hear I think there's four members of the public that have signed up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's hear the former members of the public and then we'll go to Councilwoman Sorrell. And then I'll just I'll just read them up here. If these four members could please come forward in this order, I believe it, says Jamil Ochoa or Jamil Ochoa, Karen Reside, Abraham Zavala and Jordan Winn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or if those four folks could come forward, please. Jamil Ochoa. Karen Reside, Abraham Zavala and Jordan Winn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members and city manager and city staff. My name is Joe Miller and I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrants Rights Coalition. I want to start off by asking you a question for you to reflect on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we count on the city council to fund programs like the Long Beach Justice Fund that will give legal representation to loved ones that have been kidnaped out of their homes to be put into ICE vehicles. I'm here as part of the People's Budget Coalition as I multicultural and Multi-generational Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am calling on Mayor Garcia and all nine City Council members and the city city manager to one adopt the people's budget for fiscal year 2022 and structurally reform the city budget process to enable earlier and deeper participation from marginalized communities who are most impacted by budget decisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You must make public comments accessible to the communities who deserve to be part of this process, but can't be here today because of their vulnerability to COVID 19. When is this coming back to City Council? We believe that Black Lives Matter and that our communities cannot wait any longer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As the devastating impacts a public health crisis meets the harms inflicted by systemic racism and decades of immigrant attacks, anti-immigrant attacks, the accumulation of injustices facing immigrant communities has reached a tipping point. The need for urgent action to sustain and expand universal representation is more important now than ever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Immigrants of color feel the double oppression that comes from overpolicing which are giving way too much funding to from the both law enforcement and immigration enforcement. I am here today to demand that the city allocate 600,000 already promised from the Lumbee Justice Fund through a key for the structure of funding agreed upon last year and 300 Cree'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from the American Rescue Plan promised towards the Long Beach Justice Fund earlier this year. Our government is responsible for ensuring that everyone has equal access to the care that they need. This is the government's responsibility to use our tax dollars to protect the fundamental rights, health and safety of everyone in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Universal representation ensures that the representation in immigration system operates in racially equitable way by ensuring legal representation. It helps us dismantle the present deportation pipeline and advances racial justice. We must work towards spending less city funding on policing and more on communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to see that one more time. We must stop, start working towards spending, less funding on policing and more on our communities without a process to legal representation. Immigrants are facing deportation and an already unjust system alone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's please remember that the budgets are moral documents. They must represent the priorities of our communities needs and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That your time is up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name is Karen. Resign. I'm here tonight with the Long Beach Gray Panthers and we also are on the People's Budget Partnership Coalition. And I'm here tonight to address one of the last big isms that I had hoped hoped to see more in the budget this year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's sadly lacking. Ageism and ageism. We're working on the younger part of that. We've done a lot of good things with the youth, but it seems like our older people don't exist. 155,000. And I assume that's for Bixby Knolls, which isn't even really acceptable as a senior center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm here tonight to address some of the issues. Three years ago, the city entered into the Livable Cities Initiative with AARP, which was to examine the impacts that our city had related to older adults. So far, we've done nothing for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also established the Healthy Aging Center at the Health Health Department, which has not been funded and certainly has done a main and amazing job with no money. And here we are scrambling as volunteers try and find funny find money for a plan that was not even done appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was based on a ten year old plan that doesn't include any input from baby boomers. And I have very different needs from someone that was the greatest generation. So the plan that we're using is way out of date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's time we invest some money into the needs of our seniors. When I was young, my grandmother used to go visit her every weekend. She lived here and she came to Long Beach because it was such a wonderful city for older adults.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't say that today. You know, we have to fight to get transportation. They haven't brought the passport back. Long Beach Transit is not talking about bringing the transport passport back, the senior center. Mr. Mayor, when you came and visited it two years ago, you said the city should be doing better for its seniors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every day I watched the staff try and scramble and the two people that we lost during the pandemic haven't been replaced. So there are staff shortages and they're trying desperately to do programing with no supplies. The Great Panthers were lucky enough to get a couple of grants, so we've been trying to help buy decent furniture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The furniture is all falling apart. They replaced two floors and two spaces, but not the main spaces. So they still have gaps. They're broken. They're trip hazards for seniors. Right now, senior centers is not safe for seniors to be in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For a city our size. We should have ten senior centers and they should be standalone senior centers. But that's what the recommendations for Parks and Recreation Association. So we only have really one prestige standing senior centers there were way behind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Abraham Zavala.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm with Long Beach. Residents Empowered, who is also part of the Language Arts Coalition. And our coalition is also a part of the People's Budget Coalition as well. I want to begin by acknowledging the liberated leaders who are watching right now online who couldn't be here to make public comment in person.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also, my children, they're.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Watching online as well right now. So just want to say hi to them or else when I get home they're going to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tell me something or that to say. I think it's important to keep engaging telephonically. I know there are other ways of giving folks access. So I want to share the language access coalition's budget demands that we feel would make an.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Impact in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Language is important, and I think oftentimes that can be a barrier for a lot of our folks that are different communities, right to access government, other functions as well. So we want to uplift the following three items. First, we like to have the city dedicate adequate staff to implement the Language Access Program consistently throughout the city and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'create a culture of language. Just as in Long Beach, we feel that can be best be achieved by hiring two full time program coordinators at 200,001, full time program assistant as well at 85 for a total of 35,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second, bear with me. It's very specific. Primarily move interpretation and translation services in-house to provide a faster and higher quality response to residents who need interpretation and translation. Provide Spanish and more interpretation at our City Council and Charter Commission meetings without having to make a request in advance that is so helpful for folks to come and make'",
        "'speaker_5': 'public comment whenever that's possible. So that would be something that would make an impact. So we're asking for ten Spanish interpreters, six camera interpreters, four Tagalog interpreters as city staff at an estimated 140,000 per to a total of to 2,000,800.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Third demand is to provide community based organizations who work with Aleppo residents ongoing stipends to conduct outreach about the policy. Such organizations have a deep community relationship, trust and cultural competency to do that kind of outreach to effectively communicate with residents about their rights specifically and how to access city services for a total budget amount of 3,285,000'",
        "'speaker_5': '. We feel that's fair, given that oftentimes, even when you call in over the phone, folks sometimes don't get through to the department, they need to get through. So we feel this would make a huge impact. So thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. And thank you. My name is Jordan Winn. I'm a District two resident in the city of Long Beach. My theme for the city budget today is to move past symbolic actions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And move towards permanent actions. Last year, thanks to the advocacy of the People's Budget Coalition, we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sent many of the things that were were reflected in the city's budget last year, and many of those pilots.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Continuing. We thank you for that. Last year, we also saw a decrease in the city's proposed police budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By $5 million. Tonight, we see an increase probably coming in within the fiscal budget itself, $15 million of increase coming our way. We need to move past symbolic measures and start dedicating ourself wholeheartedly with the millions of dollars that go there into community resources instead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not hundreds of thousands of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dollars for our seniors, for our families, but millions. We need to start investing those real dollars. I'm here to present three specific items from the Housing Justice Coalition of Long Beach that are three budget priorities that build on some of the things that the people's budget brought forth last year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One is a dedication to the rental housing division. We're very grateful to the City Council for dedicating $1 million from the Long Beach Recovery Act for the creation of three temporary housing navigator positions. And we now call on the city to build on that commitment and fund the creation of a permanent, structurally funded and fully staffed rental'",
        "'speaker_7': 'housing division within development services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Rental Housing Division would be staffed by one division officer full time, two planners.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Full time, two administrative analysts, three assistant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Military analysts, two clerks, and one deputy city attorney. We've broken it down very.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Granularly, and it is this kind of service that is very necessary to maintain the large housing stock that we have within our city. And as we continue to expand and grow as a wonderful city that we are, this is going to become a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Greater and greater need for us locally.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Number two is tenant rights of council. We are asking for $7 million of that. There was a pilot program launched last year, dedicated $250 million, one time in the fiscal year 2021 budget for right to counsel. The city further acknowledged the need for additional funding by allocating $900,000 to right council for the Long Beach Recovery Act, which'",
        "'speaker_7': 'will be spent fully over the next two years. We really do appreciate that this dedication is coming out from the city.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The city to fully fund this crucial program, which.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Has only received partial.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'As we've seen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are still waiting on funding, and Long Beach needs a fully funded right to counsel program to prevent mass displacement. Finally, we call on the city to continue to invest in community.'",

To fund the remaining balance of our original budget ask, we're thankful for the original allocation of $1 million from the Long Beach Recovery Act. And once again, we ask the city to go further for our low income black indigenous tenants of color who've been disproportionately impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Thank you very much.'",

And I also want to thank our amazing city staff, city manager and the mayor's leadership for in the past year of navigating us through such a challenging time with the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I know that that's been one of the things that's been mentioned earlier, how we've also been just impacted financially in so many ways. But I also just want to lift up our amazing residents who have been there for each other and protected each other by providing mutual aid and assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While we are not yet out of the pandemic, I think that it's an amazing, you know, the way that our city staff and mayor as well is helping us lead into the recovery part and grateful for the federal and state funding that's making it possible.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That's ranging from early childhood education and support to the physical and mental health equity to violence prevention and safe cities and homelessness. So I really want to make sure we lift that up because a lot of money is being invested into our community and particularly want to make sure to point out that 600,000 is going to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'justice fund and 700,000 is going to the language access. Supporting and language access are so important to me and ensuring that, you know, we're making sure, you know, we're able to communicate across various languages as well as accessibility as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just want to mention of the 700 million for our language. Access and 600,000 for the Justice one. It's the most we've ever funded in these two areas, as well as our source 1.8 million into the digital inclusion.'",

I know it was a lot of information thrown at all of you and we're hoping that, as you know, this comes up over time and that it's various opportunities for engagement, that there are opportunities for more digestion of the information shared and better dialog and more dialogs that can be had in the community'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and with each other about it. So that's just what I wanted to make sure that provide to share. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Before I go to Councilman Manga, I do want to just add to that because I think she had mentioned two items that I had was chatting with someone earlier about it. Just it's important to note that the justice fund is as is at $600,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you look at the full budget, which is the largest allocation it's had. And so it's something I strongly support and I know the community supports and I think that we have seen those resources put to work and how important they are to ensure legal protection for people that are incredibly vulnerable and that need our support as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a community. In addition, I just want to say on the language access question that Councilman Sara brought up, Mr. Monaco, you also we don't have to do it today, but I think there's also I know that the 700,000 direct allocation is the largest direct allocation we've made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that there's also resources within language access that is kind of split among departments or that you've put into other departments. So the actual number, I think is a lot larger. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. It actually in FY 22, if when you total up all the programs that we do for language access, it's $3.2 million. So we can break that out for you. There is the staffing in the city manager's office, about $323,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We then have, you know, $250,000 in the Recovery Act budget. We then have our health department budget and our economic development budget. And then we also pay a number of city staff members to be bilingual. And that's about $1.8 million, $1.9 million, so that they're always available to the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'd like to have one of our follow up items be to break this down for you so that we can get a truer picture of language access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate that. And I know I've had I was chatting with someone from the Language Access Coalition. I think there just needs to be a they just want to kind of understand at least what's in the current budget and how it's broken up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that way I think I think it'd be helpful for the community and for the council to have a better understanding of how those resources are are divided up in the city. So we can have a better idea of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So but thank you, Councilwoman Sara, for for the for the bringing up those items. Let me go to Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I think that and I don't want to speak for Councilmember Odinga, but a long time we've been fighting about language access and the movement forward. And I think that what has really come of it is not about an allocation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that in many of my one on ones with community groups we talk about it's not about an allocation, it's about a full integration into the city as a component of what we do, period. It's a part of what we do and there isn't an amount that it is limited to or associated with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's everything needs to be available in the languages. And specifically we've talked about and different departments have different needs and have different access to different communities and have more need or less need. And from year to year, those adjustments just need to be made so that people have access period.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just to follow up on that. Page 12 of the presentation talks about rental assistance. It's my understanding that additional funds have become available July one through the state budget, but we had previously closed the window on the rental assistance funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we plan to reopen it because of these new funds?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we had extended our rental assistance program twice and we are incorporated those new funds into the third revision. So the 51 million includes the new money that we got as well, and that's now in the recovery plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's part of the reason it went up from 235 up into to 49.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So do we believe we have applicants for that much funding?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when we assessed it over the weekend, we were looking at July 11th as the date we had contemplated potentially extending it, but we did a big push on social media, on outreach, and we got enough applications to fulfill the whole $51 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're currently. So we closed it and we're going through the process with applicants to help them with all the paperwork that they need to file for federal and state reimbursement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when do we think that money will be operationalized and in the hands of the community?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some of it's gone out already. I sent out an update, I think a week and a half ago. I can get you a new one. At that point, several million dollars had already gone out. And we have just it's a big process to go through that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we let checks out every single week when we get those applications done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we think six weeks, eight weeks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have that answer right now. I don't know if Oscar or Christopher does. Christopher's got a better handle on it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council member, we expect about $2 million to go out the door this week and then we expect the amount of going out the door to increase each week over the coming six weeks. So in 6 to 8 weeks, we will have paid out a very large portion of the rental assistance, but then we'll be into the very'",
        "'speaker_6': 'difficult cases. So we have cases where one party or the other isn't cooperating or there's a paperwork problem or there's audit trail problem. So it's hard for me to say everything will be paid in eight weeks. Most things will be paid in eight weeks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But then when we get to the really difficult ones, it'll take us all the way until December 31st to pay out those more difficult cases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wonderful. Thank you for that information. I want to take a pause from my questions because I kind of move things around based on other comments of my colleagues. And I just want to thank the staff. I know not everybody spends the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The moment these books are released, my staff know they come to my house immediately or I drive to City Hall and get them. I spent the weekend with these books and I love what you've done with them. We've come a really long way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've always been excellent, but the amount of work that you've put in this year, the different layouts that you've adopted, the more easy to read sections. For those of you who don't know, when people call my office and ask questions, I reference the book and I send them the PDF and I think that this is more user'",
        "'speaker_4': 'friendly. And so what I meet with community groups and we have questions. The quality of this book makes a difference and I really think it's a reflection of the staff and the efforts and the training. I have to say my favorite part is that you have our fiscal or fiscal policies in the beginning of the book.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's a really important reminder and I really appreciate and through the work that we did together for several years to get these right, that they're front and center for people to remember why we do what we do and why it's important to be with our revenue projections and how we handle each and every component of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this book. So and I think that that will really help for years to come. So I want to thank the staff for all the work that went into this. And not just the budget staff. The budget staff that are in the facility manager's office are critical and important, but there are also a lot of staff out in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'departments and a lot of those staff are stretched really thin and taking multiple hats in the department at this time. And so I want to take an extra special moment to thank you, filling out all the reports and requirements and projections that the city manager's office requests are not easy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just look forward to seeing more details in the police budget about the least cost of the radio. That just sounded like a high number for lease costs versus purchase price. I don't know a lot about it, so I don't know if we're frontloading it and putting in a reserve account or maybe I can go into that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at that presentation and then I look forward to additional details on measure use and what that's going to look like on the granular level when we get there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'RICHARDSON Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thanks city staff for the presentation. I was able to watch the budget reveal the other day, so I got a bit of a head start on some of this and I'm sure most of the community has to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to acknowledge the speakers who came forward I think is really good. And I think I don't remember if it was Jordan or someone who kind of articulated, you know, last year's budget, then the recovery, the pieces that the community advocated for and have made it in, I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The community should be proud of those achievements and the council should be proud of those achievements. These are significant investments that helped shape the region. Other people pay attention to these impacts. You know, enough members of the council spoke to the justice, foreign language, access and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we know that there's always more to do and we have a good organizing base in our community that will continue to push the city, and that's just the dynamics of inside outside. And so we know that there's certainly much more to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I do want to say, you know, context is important. This time last year, we were I think we were talking about relief efforts and sick days, and we were in a very, very different place. And to have a budget in front of us with no service cuts at a time when our services are already stretched, strained'",
        "'speaker_6': ', I think is important. And it would not have been possible if it hadn't been for the federal relief that we're fortunate to receive the CARES Act. We didn't originally receive that. We were just shy of the 500,000 we had to go agitate to get resources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the fact that we're in a place where we don't have cuts, I think that's important context because we're not out of the clear. This is the very, very beginning of a recovery. But we are not out of the out of the woods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our revenues have not recovered. We're in a different place. And I think we need to understand that now. There are some good things that I'm proud of in this in this budget. Some new things measure us and and, you know, some of the recovery dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's important that the reconciliation came up a lot. And, you know, I think I think that we need to make sure that we are keeping score and telling the story outwardly of the way the reconciliation is shaped.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of this and, you know, it was organized in a way there was immediate, immediate mid-term, long term investments. And there's actually a really good story to tell on some of the immediate and the short term and medium term investments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to see us tell that story a bit better. We launched the Office of Youth Development this year. That's important. We're investing in violence prevention. That's important. We didn't have staff for violence prevention before we adopted Measure US.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was called out in the reconciliation plan the voters adopted. That opens up the playbook, allows us we'll talk a little bit more about that. But I think that opens up the playbook, allows some down payments on some really important things like the youth fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's policy things in front of in front of us that we know some we move forward on that were called out inclusionary housing inclusive play box checked. There are some things that still are outstanding we know we need to do CPK reform.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We funded the study. We look forward to closing that out and putting in front of the voters. You have a health equity center called out. There's an item this evening talking about the health equity center. There's alternative. A big, big item was alternative clinical response model that was big over the course of the past year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we look forward to the update and where we are with alternative clinical response model. That's that's important the community that's for that and a whole host of other things that are really creative people have advocated for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've advocated for some of these for a long time, like down payment assistance, economic empowerment zones. Some of the economic inclusion work called out everyone in the community land trust. These are really, really good ideas and strategies that have been funded.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I look forward to an update where we can look comprehensively at where we are now in terms of major U.S. that that really I'm glad to see that here. Mary has opened up the playbook and we're fortunate to the voters for making that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm glad to see the great majority that almost $1,000,000 invested in youth. We need to make sure that you know we go back to particularly we invest in youth coalition is push for our youth fund for a very long time we're going to have a community discussion, a youth town hall with them on August 5th to take'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a deeper dove and hear directly from youth about now this is possible and the reality. What do we need to consider? I think the investments in community health from us I think is a great start. We've talked about investing as seniors in aging adults, the fact that we're going to have funding to dedicate now to that to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'help build out that program I think is good. And I think with climate, the goal was to have funding to leverage, to amplify the impact on accelerating our climate action adaptation plan. And what you see is an alignment that allows us to go out to groups like AQAP and others and multiply the impact on our climate resiliency'",
        "'speaker_6': 'programs. So we only have 5 minutes immaculate later, but we only have 5 minutes. But but I think these are things that I think need to be discussed in this budget and the things that in general, as an implementation point, we need to be better at telling the story and communicating outwardly the work, the good work that's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'happening within the city and understand the delta of where we still need to push.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Marie Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I want to follow up on Vice Mayor Richardson's comments regarding the discussions we're going to have in the future. On slide 27, you have a schedule there of hearings, and we're going to be coming up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that three of those are going to be out in the community and encouraging the community to please come out to those public hearings so we can hear you and and share your thoughts and ideas as to how we can build a better budget for the city of Long Beach or build one at least that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is strong and addresses all the needs that we have at the city. I also want to make sure that we are inclusive in our budget hearings that we have. We have all four points of our city east, west, north and south to make sure that there is an ample opportunity for people from all over the city to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'attend these hearings. One of the most important things that I think came up for me anyway. And I want to thank Councilmember Mungo and Councilmember Sarah, of course, our mayor, for bringing up the issues related to language access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Everybody knows that this has been a very important item for me in regards to communication, being able to talk to our people, to our residents from all languages, from all backgrounds, because we can't if we don't have and we don't speak their language.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's very important. And I'm glad that city manager, you brought up some issues there that are that are internal, that are actually built in to our language access program, such as bilingual staff. I know I can speak to it from a historical perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I used to be the the bilingual language assessor providing the skimpy. So I know that there are city staff out there who are receiving the skill page, but obviously it's not enough. We need a lot more and we probably need to budget it more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm looking forward to those discussions and those hearings when we can throughout the city. Is there going to be a specific schedule in regards to what departments are going to be reviewed in these budget hearings as we move along, like, for example, August 3rd, August 10th, in August 17th, which I think are the three that you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have scheduled in the community before we get our first adoption date of August 24th. I'm especially interested in in those departments that are non non city manager departments. I'm talking specifically about civil service department. I mean, they're they're the biggest department that does all our employment testing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They test for basically all jobs in the city. And that's where also the the bilingual skill comes in with the civil service department in regards to testing that these individuals apply for for these skilled jobs do, in fact, possess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is there going to be a release of of a schedule of what departments are going to be coming to the city council or rephrase it to the budget hearings in the future?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So we do have a proposal. We do this every year where we identify certain departments and then we get council feedback. And it's important that we get consensus. We have 23 departments and it's hard to do every single one and be efficient with your time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we do want to get input from you on that. You can go through what those are. We had originally planned on kind of focusing since the changes are really in the Recovery Act that we focus a lot of the presentations on those that are getting resources and programs in the Recovery Act.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council member. We have a budget hearing next on August 3rd for the CIP presentation. Then on August 10th, we have the health department and the police department presenting. And then on August 17th, we have the fire department and Economic Development Department presenting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then two weeks following that or the following week, we have our first budget adoption night on August 24th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a pretty aggressive schedule. So I'm guessing, Mayor, that we're trying to adopt our budget while before September 30th or the date that we actually have to?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I mean, the council always can adopt it whenever it would like up until that date. I think we also released the budget was also, I think probably out probably about two weeks earlier than normal. So I think the staff is adjusting for that time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think normally we probably have this conversation like two weeks from now or the first budget presentation. So I think it's just an adjustment for that. But we can I think any time the council wants to add an apartment to one of these sessions, I think we're able to just let Mr. Morgan to go at it'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Yeah, I did have a brief discussion with Mr. Moore today about a presentation, and since I'm making a request also to include an department, perhaps we could do it at that time as well, or be able to accommodate other department presentations at a at a hearing if we need to adjust a just a schedule a little bit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'by, you know, the August 24 or when we back the August 24 through the seventh and the seven to the 14th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And I would and I know that I would, I would connect definitely. I know that Councilmember Austin is not here, but I know that he's working on the schedule with staff as well. So definitely want to connect with him as well and we'll go from there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman and the house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor And first of all, thank you for that great presentation to city staff, especially financial management. Thank you very much. Agree with most all of the comments being said by my colleagues tonight. One of my top priorities as a councilwoman is public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's crucial for our city or our thriving city to be the best and make sure that our residents feel as safe as possible, especially our youth. I feel that they need to feel protected and our youth are usually seen as easy targets when they go alone to parks or, you know, to play basketball at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'courts or even just walking home from school. So I wanted to see what if there was a if we could look into maybe the feasibility of establishing a program that would consist of police placing panic buttons throughout our parks, especially those that suffer the most violent crimes and and are most at risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that, you know, if a child is in danger or feels harassed, that that would be something really good to have it where they could press the alert or the panic button and they could receive immediate help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that they have such a program like that at Cal State University, Long Beach, and would like to see what kind of feasibility that would be. And on another note, I think that one of the things that I've been like council member Ortega and Council member Sara Champion on is language access.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the things that I worry about is not having the best interpretation for our residents when they come up and speak. You know, sometimes the the translation isn't as effective as it could be. So, again, I would like to see a feasibility on what it would be to to actually move the translation services in-house and actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be able to provide those, those individuals with training some of the wordings and terminology and words that we use during council meetings that we, our residents that don't speak English, can really get their true meaning across them by having by having these kinds of interpretations or employees that serve as interpreters in-house might be the best way to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'go. So I know we've we've been working really hard to get the best interpretation that we can get, but I think it would be very beneficial to us to have those in the house. So I'd like to see us look into that and let's see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also I'd like to see us maybe look into the feasibility of building like community centers in the hardest hit neighborhoods with violent crimes. I think that prevent having programs that prevent violent crimes are are super important. So I'm really looking forward to seeing something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be able to bring community centers to those particular areas, I think would be more than beneficial. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go ahead and just add up again. No. Okay. So thank you to the to the council for those comments. There'll be obviously additional opportunities for the budget hearing that will continue on. I just want to just make a note of three other items, Mr. City Manager, I know we can discuss in the weeks'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ahead. And these are things that have been mentioned to me by some council members community. I want to just first highlight, I think, some of what Vice Mayor Richard Sutton said around measure U.S.. I think one thing that you and I mentioned at the presentation that we did to to the media and to the to the community'",
        "'speaker_0': ', we, I think, obviously, staff put together a proposal for measure us that is a lot of work from a lot of departments. And I think we also recognize, and I certainly do that it's the first year that Measure USA is coming in and this was a community effort.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I expect that there will be some dialog among the council and some strong thoughts about how that money should be spent in this first year. And so I think that staff should be ready to hear from council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as far as how those dollars should be, should be set aside, I think that broadly speaking, I think the proposal you guys have put together hits a lot of those major points, but I think there will be some dialog around that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to note that for the staff. I also want to note that I have had some conversations about, you know, in our in our budget, there is a proposal to change kind of how we do a helicopter patrol within the police department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's something that's been discussed in the past. And you send out information to the council in a memo. I do think that deserves broader discussion on this body this year as part of as part of this budget cycle as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think most of us are first and foremost concerned about safety and ensuring that the helicopter system that we have in place is able to do the work they need to do, particularly in across the city and and in support to other jurisdictions and vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to ask staff to be prepared to have that conversation in the weeks ahead. And then I also want I'd like to ask Steph about there are resources in this budget for digital inclusion. And what I'm really excited about is today there was this huge announcement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, the governor signed a I think a six, $7 billion digital inclusion bill, which dwarfs the enormous amount of money that we put in our digital inclusion, which is exciting. So I would just like I think we said in the budget that maybe we put maybe 2 million for digital inclusion.'",
        "'speaker_0': '1.8.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's 1.8.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I support that. But what I'd like to know in the next couple weeks also is what how much, considering the author of the Digital Inclusion Bill lives in Long Beach and she's very committed to bringing those resources down here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to see if there's an opportunity to, you know, dramatically increase what we're actually going to spend on digital inclusion and ensure that the dollars that we put aside are if that's where they should be and they likely should be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just want to make sure that we're looking at the digital inclusion part of money that got signed by the governor today. And I think for those that hadn't heard, this is probably the biggest digital, digital and broadband investment in the state of California to low income communities and to communities that are underserved by broadband.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's going to be substantial for us in Long Beach or we are excited about that. And so with that, there is a motion and a second to continue the hearing to the next meeting and receive and file the information that was presented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Members, please cast your vote on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Motion carries.'"

        "'speaker_6': 'Action. Nothing really has changed. One of the key components of our concern is how the primary business is defined. You heard tonight it's defined as a restaurant, and somewhere in the last 20 years it has shifted from a restaurant to a bar.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In looking at the city zoning ordinance, if the city were to define it as what it is a bar, we don't believe there would be any grandfathering allowed and they would have to go through a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The reason we have conditional use permit is so that you can see how a specific operation is being done at a specific location. If this establishment was in a commercial center or a community center, it may not have any problems.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'They moved from city to city and are really, really dangerous. So great work from you and your staff and thank you for a well-written item and a great presentation. I'll be in support tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, support this item. I happen to be very familiar with these takeovers as I represent the prosecuting agency that's handled a bunch of these cases in Orange County. And it is also a state crime to point a laser at a law enforcement officer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not only a federal crime. So we can be a little bit more aggressive with that because you're absolutely right, it's incredibly dangerous not just to law enforcement, but to anyone that has a laser pointed in their eyes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it can cause additional traffic fatalities, which are obviously very tragic for everyone and just as violent as any other type of violent crime. So thank you for bringing this item. And I support it 100%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you. Council members, super and all for bringing this item forward. And looking at that video, it just made me very angry. This is an important issue that has gotten significantly worse during the pandemic. It's important that we stop these events which are happening all across the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I heard from residents on shoreline, on the ocean corridors, pit parking and the turn around at Rainbow Harbor. And these are events are happening in downtown as well. They're dangerous, they're disrespectful. And I think an ordinance and penalties are definitely needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Counting rooms in the house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And vice mayor. Thank you. Councilmember Super not for bringing this forward. I think it's very important that we bring this forward right now and especially before there is loss of life. I think that is very important. And you were right the first time that I saw the video.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did not see those passengers hanging out of the window. And when I did see that, it just made me cringe because they're risking their life and and the lives of others as well. So thank you so much for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I look forward to supporting this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thank you all for my comments here. Thank you, Councilmember Sabrina, for bringing this forward. We've we've had this issue in in North Long Beach, particularly the Hamilton neighborhood. We talk with staff about it. And I agree. We need to look at, you know, solutions to to address it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I agree that something needs to be done. And while I wholeheartedly support doing that, you know, I have to say, when I looked at that video, what I saw was a bunch of teenagers and middle school kids. So so I think this is like we should go look at alternatives and look at strategies, but we should also'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be mindful of all the work we've done around My Brother's Keeper alternative path. We have more tools in the toolbox, so when it comes back, I want to see it comprehensive. What we learned when we did the PATH program was a lot of times young people within a certain age, their first experience with the city is with'",
        "'speaker_6': 'law enforcement, and that can have positive effects and also have negative effects in terms of their development in time. So so if a 14 year old gets caught at one of these, I think there are, you know, path program essentially gave them, hey, you know, the penalties for doing these things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, we can connect you with this resource that the city has or that resource and bring them into one of our mentoring programs, something I think we need to just be comprehensive, particularly with young adults. So on these programs, I'm supportive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our residents know that like we're very, very clear we shouldn't do it. I've seen we've done roundabouts in some of these intersections and that's helped. I think we need to invest a little bit further. And if we were to do a hotspot map, I'll tell you, you're going to see a lot of those incidents in North Palm'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Beach. You're going to see them in a lot of different areas. But you may see some trends. You may see some trends that say, hey, a little bit of infrastructure investment here or there could help, like calm down what's happened in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what I'm saying is both and we should certainly look at penalties, we should also just be developmentally sensitive and appropriate when we deal with young people. This is my comments there, Councilmember Supernormal. You know, I just want to respond to that a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First of all, this item was brought forth very quickly. You mentioned I got the phone call on this Friday night at 11 p.m.. Did the research over the weekend that my deadline was Monday at noon to get this thing agenda?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So not a lot of time. But ironically, KFI Radio had a special on this topic on that Monday night. And one thing and I think one of the reporters embedded with CHP, I believe in up in the Valley.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the points they made was because I believe CHP or some other agency found an abandoned airstrip or something, say, hey, guys, just go out and do the donuts there. That wasn't the thrill. That is not what these kids wanted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The thrill was escaping the police. So I think where traditionally we might want to look at alternatives to this activity, I guess we always do. But you're really up against it on this one in terms of finding an alternative for this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thanks, vice mayor. I also want to add to your comments about, you know, well, I'll say that, you know, I do agree that a lot of these activities are dangerous. And, you know, it's important that we do take steps to addressing it and looking at, you know, it's common for a reason in the sense that, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, it's more than one parts of our city. And I wanted to also raise that. You know, Atlanta had the same issue. And, you know, they ended up setting up a specific area and dates and where takeovers are actually allowed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, again, you know, I think it's important that if they're going to happen. Right, is there a way that we could consider it being a legal space for them to do so? Obviously, there should be parameters like maybe no, you know, certain, but but you know, that's another alternative I want to add.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to to consider as well. Right. Because sometimes while, you know, taking these approaches might seem like it work, it might not as well. Right. It might end up being more common because it's adding to, you know. So anyway, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to make sure we're open to all kinds of ideas. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. It's been a while since I've had a really in detail conversation from a public safety standpoint of this, and maybe Councilman Price can add some context. But from what I understand, the individuals who were taken these, they go all over the region.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so putting them into our local programs, we have to have a way to refer them to local programs in their own community that have a better connectivity to who they are. And I don't know what that looks like long term in terms of our influence on other cities and their programs and what we can do to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'encourage those. But I think that there there has to be a an enforcement component and then there has to be a handoff because like we've learned with homelessness, we can provide all those wraparound services. But if they're not in the areas where those individuals want to be or they don't have a support system there, they're really not'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going to provide the outcomes that are necessary and they're going to recycle back into these programs. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilman Turanga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Great discussion. But, you know, I'm sort of unclear. I'd like to have a definition of what a street takeover event is, only because I don't want to see that there's an unintended consequence. If there is a protest, car's just going through an intersection or going to a council members house to protest something and then it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'becomes something else. So, I mean, I think it's very important that we get a very clear indication, a clear handle on what is a street takeover event so that we can impose or some of these. And I agree with the concern of Richardson in regards to, you know, we could get some alternatives for these kids who especially'",
        "'speaker_3': 'who are younger than than 18 and curfew setting and what are they doing out there. And of course, to a classroom or sorrows about, you know, creating a safe space where these people that they want to do such a thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I my district has also been affected by by this event. I only see the evidence. I haven't seen it actually in life or has anybody sent me any video of this kind of event? I don't see the evidence as the donut in the middle of the street in one of the larger intersections in my district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm hoping that if and when staff comes back with this ordinance, that there will be a clear written definition as to what it is so that it's not misinterpreted, so that other people who are, you know. Maybe cruising or just or, like I said, going to a protest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, who are writing, you know, following each other in a card are not misinterpreted as to being for this it to be applicable to that of it. I know. I make clear what I'm saying. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Next, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Put in a plug right now for an organization that's very close to my heart, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. They have a driver impact panel that now is used as a diversion option. So if someone gets a citation instead of having to plead guilty and having a conviction on their record and having it have a lasting impact as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a diversion option, they can attend this driver impact course through MADD and I. I sit on their advisory board. I'm very involved with Matt, and I have attended a couple of the driver impact panels. Most of the people that are ordered by the court to go to the panels are between the ages of 18 and 25.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're engaged in speed contests as well as the takeover efforts, which it's a very, very different thing than a protest. I mean, totally different definition just with the number of cars that are required and the coordinated nature of them and the length of time that they take.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so those panels are designed for specifically young individuals who participate in these types of activities. And they have speakers on there who are mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters who've lost a loved one as a result of a traffic fatality, either related to speeding or reckless involvement in a in a take over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So driving or car takeover.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that there are a lot of opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Both preventative opportunities, but also rehabilitative opportunities for those who are cited to have an opportunity to get an education. See from the other side how their actions could impact someone else's life unintentionally, and perhaps that serves as a deterrent for the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would love and I know that our city prosecutor also serves on the MADD panel with me on the advisory council. So I will communicate with him as possibly that being an option that can be offered as a diversion as as we're doing in Orange County as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So we've heard. Preventative measures, infrastructure penalties. We've heard alternatives. You heard a lot. Good discussion, a lot of good direction as any public comment on this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. There's one public comment. Adrina Redman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Audrina Redmond, resident of District two. Active member of Black Lives Matter, Long Beach and member of the People's Budget Coalition. I wanted to speak to this item for precisely the reason that Councilman Urunga brought forward, which was how the potential for how it could be used against people protesting and righteous protesting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to now that I've heard comments from Urunga, Sara Richardson and even Ward Councilor Price said, I want to appreciate what you said because it seems to me. That there are there are laws in place. There are alternatives to policing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are alternatives to criminalizing people. And it saddens me to know in that after all of the activities in this city and across our country and across the world last year, that the creative juices are not running in here among some of you, that your effort to address this issue goes immediately to the notion of policing and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'criminalizing, rather than recognizing that young people are young people, that people do risky things when they're young, and that there are long term consequences for folks when they are criminalized early on in life. And so, again, I want to take to the take the council members who raise those issues, and I want to encourage that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The laws that are in place to address what did you bring up? Council supernovae, the lasers we have, we are able to deal with that. If we're talking about traffic issues, we're able to deal with those already. We don't need new laws that punish people and we don't need new laws that will have yet another excuse for'",

Honorable Mayor and members of the city council meeting are here this evening to present the proposed amendments to the Human Relations Commission and to seek approval for the ordinance to be revised.'",

The first of which is to end systemic racism in Long Beach in all local government and partner agencies through internal transformation. From their strategy for is focused on building robust organizational capacity to support anti-racist reform.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Here is a timeline of the process we've been engaging in since you provided this direction in January. In February, the Commission met to discuss counsel's direction, a timeline process, and formed an ad hoc committee who could dedicate some additional time to this effort outside regular monthly meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This ad hoc committee met with the city attorney to best understand the parameters of the City Charter and role of advisory commissions. In March, the Office of Equity held a visioning session with community stakeholders to gather input around what the functions and role of a Re-envision commission could entail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In April, the Ad Hoc Committee reported back to the Commission on the visioning session themes and began discussing and forming recommendations which the Commission voted on in May and circulated for review with the city attorney and city manager in June.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are excited to share these recommendations for your consideration this evening. The proposed amendments in the Long Beach Municipal Code Chapter 2.4 cover four key areas related to the Human Relations Commission, including the name, purpose, functions and membership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will now walk through each of these areas. Thank you, Theresa. So the Human Relations Commission proposed the revised name of the Equity and Human Relations Commission. There are multiple options being explored by the commission members and community stakeholders, but ultimately they narrowed it down to a few options.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An Equity in Human Relations Commission emerged. The name was selected to lead with equity first, while also acknowledging and uplifting the human impacts that we were seeking to achieve through our equity efforts. Next, I will walk through the three revised purposes of the commission.'",

Also to serve as a forum for community discussion on equity and social justice policy issues, and to encourage input and participation from the groups most impacted by these issues.'",

The second recommendation is to ensure that the Commission is broadly representative of those persons and groups impacted by inequity at the individual community and systems level.'",

And finally, that members must attend an implicit bias or anti-racism training upon being appointed to the Commission.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So I think you've done you've done your job, and I'm happy to support what you put in front of me. There's one area and, you know, I you know, I think it needs to be a little tighter on one area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, focus on the programing and all these other things. I would have loved to see systems or policy added in there, too, because the part of this is really systems and policy. So, you know, that's just my only feedback there.'",

I'm a lifelong resident here in District two, and I am coming to you as the vice chair of the hopefully soon to be renamed Equity and Human Relations Commission. I'm here to support agenda item 15, which is this recommendation to revise the title of the Human Relations Commission to the Equity and Human Relations'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We want to see some dedicated staff time so that they don't have to work five times harder than most other folks. As the City of Long Beach engages in efforts to institutionalize equity and infuse an equity lens throughout this process, it's we want to move that through its practices, policies and decision making.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it has and it is critical that an independent citizen commission has the ability to advise, advise city council on matters of equity and social justice and be on hand to provide accountably accountability and partnership throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just as you said, vice mayor. I think policy is most important in the work that we're doing. This is something I know we've been able to do in past years as we present and comment in council. But with this change in ordinance, we will ensure that this work continues into the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On that note, we are hoping that not only will you support this ordinance tonight, but that you will look at the items that were recommended through the process from community commissioners and staff. One important piece is that we also need to staff this important work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But as Chair Sardinia's stated in the Cape Cod presentation, all commissioners want the community to come out and share their needs so each commission can help. We meet on the first Wednesday of each month and would like to make sure that any of the community here come out to our meetings and be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Another recommendation we have is about commissions. What we found through our work is that this is not the only commission we need to look at. A women's commission is desperately needed in this town to look at the work of what we can do to uphold these people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's critically important, especially when we're thinking about naming buildings and naming bridges. It's important to think about women in that as well. I wanted to also share that some of the work that we also need to be doing is around ensuring that this work goes on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are going to be coming back to you to talk to you about how we can make this a charter commission. We know that you all uphold the values that we that we hold dear, this commission. But we don't know that you're that the people that come after you will as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you so much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. My name's Chanel Smith. I'm a resident of District three and the district appointed to the Human Relations Commission. And I want to thank Council for your recognition of all of the hard work that went into this new name and the new purposes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to that, the staff, Teresa and Katy, for the amazing work that they did in helping us through this process. I won't take up too much time. I think that Commissioner Erikson said it perfectly. Vice Mayor, I appreciate your comments on how this is really a systemic issue and how this commission needs to start looking at systems'",
        "'speaker_2': ', which is why we want to have the revised duties that the Equity and Human Relations Commission are asking for.

        "'speaker_2': 'we'll be coming back. It's really important that we have staff to support this and that we recognize that we're not asking to reinvent the wheel.

        "'speaker_4': 'in the city manager's office. Back then, maybe you could imagine the Human Relations Commission was a little bit pooh poohed, for lack of a better word. It wasn't really lifted up or valued. There was not budget and staff support that I was able to give was very minimal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that commitment just wasn't there. So this is very encouraging to see this effort being made and this support from staff and hopefully from you, all this council and really making this change. I had the honor to independently outside of my 9 to 5 or nine train or depending how late this goes tonight, my full time'",
        "'speaker_4': 'job to participate in the March 24th Community Stakeholder Visioning session. There were about 25 no 35 passionate community members and ten staff, I believe. And it was an amazing experience. Folks shared, very frankly, how much they care about human relations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some great tips on how commissions could function. So I definitely encourage you to read the report that is added here in the materials. And I wanted to tell all of you council members that some people in the community have a perception and concern that you all don't necessarily embrace equity to its fullest and that there may be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'staff who do not embrace equity to its fullest and that there's work to be done there. We're really looking for actions beyond words, as well as funding and budget and change in system and policy. So the community was very clear that they're looking for your leadership to really show how deeply you embrace equity, diversity and inclusion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Something I was reminded in the process is that the Human Relations Commission was started and then restarted again in response to police brutality. And back then there was an article about 30 years ago where a person who was involved said, We really hope this commission gets some teeth this time, so we're asking you for some teeth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please support this item. Please support deeper equity regardless of race, sexual orientation, our age or immigration status. It's vital that we see diversity, equity and inclusion priorities in our government. We're waiting for your leadership. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Vice Mayor Rex Richardson, council people, city staff. I see the equity team over there. I see fellow commissioner here. My name is John Schulz and I'm a 20 year resident of the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Today I speak to you as a member of the Human Relations Commission. I'm the newest member, and really, I've only seen these people on on Zoom. And you guys all look better in person briefing. I ask you for your support of agenda item 15.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Up on the screen, the logistics call for a name change. Some additional commissioners that's likely to pass at a moment. So today I'm going to advocate, advocate and encourage the city manager, the mayor and the council to help find the funds requested in this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a relatively small amount, and we do have some federal one times to look at, especially any of those funds that require an eye on equity. We have a huge task of reconciliation ahead of us. Help us help you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the policies, logistics and implementation of equity and everything that that word means to our city. That's what I got. Thank you for your time. Stay healthy. Fantastic. Thank you. All right. Well, thank you all for your participation here.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Let's hear that presentation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much, Vice Mayor, members of the council, we heard very clearly from this council earlier this year that we were expecting to dedicate additional resources towards what we call our safety recovery plan. We have that plan ready and in front of you tonight as a proposed plan for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Assistant City Manager Linda Tatum will take us through the presentation and the different buckets. And it's important to remember that while we're proposing some additional safety resources, that's coupled with what's in the Recovery Act already, which was really focused heavily on longer term violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're going to cover that as well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Linda to walk us through the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Tom. We'll get started and we'll try to keep this fairly brief, as all of you are aware, since the start of the pandemic back in 20. Like many other cities, the city of Long Beach has had a significant increase in violent crime, especially crime around gun violence.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a national issue, not just a local Long Beach issue. And it stems from economic distress, unemployment and societal stresses due to the pandemic. Gun sales have increased nationally. They're up nationally. Long Beach Police Department firearm seizures are up, as well as firearm assaults.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In Long Beach. They are up 60% compared to 2020. And a call to action. Last month, the city council requested that the city manager work with our police department to develop a plan to address these increased levels of violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The police department began their work in 2020 and they focused on a number of strategies to reduce violent crime. And I'll just highlight those here. They are neighborhoods and partnerships with community based nonprofits, organizations in the community. They are very focused on data driven approaches to allocating their over time and resources to address crime.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're also they rolled out this year a pilot program on a community or a coordinated response team, and they are committed to the implementation of policies, procedures and through the implementation of the Office of Constitutional Policing, which is a new component of the police department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city manager worked with the police department and has is proposing this safety recovery plan that includes investments in additional policing measures and additional violence prevention work that was approved through the Long Beach Recovery Act that was approved by the council earlier this year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This plan allocates $5 million in one time general fund dollars, and these programs are led essentially by city staff. But they really do rely on those community partnerships with nonprofits and community organizations to implement specific components of these plans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the funding will go not only to the to the city staff, but also to some of those organizations that will be assisting city staff in these efforts. This investment includes, as I said before, $5 million for violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that is in addition to the $3.6 million that the city council approved through the Long Beach Recovery Act program earlier this year. And when you combine the 5 million with the 3.6 million, that's a total of $8.63 million that will be focused in our community to address violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But also importantly, it will address violence prevention. And again, I will note that that funding goes to not just the city staff and that the various programs, but it will it includes components that rely upon funding for community based organizations as partners in these efforts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll walk you through some of the programs. These are all highlighted in the staff report, but I'd like to just talk about these. And these are the the new or continued programs that are proposed in the community in the safety recovery plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The first of these is the coordinated response team, and this is funding both sworn and non sworn PD staff. They will investigate firearm incidents using crime analysis and intelligence techniques, and that's a $1.7 million. There's also what we call calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's fundamentally enhancing base staff staffing levels in the police department. This program supports reductions that occurred from last year's budget reductions in the police department. And it essentially is designed to maintain existing beat and deployment levels among the officers in the police department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that the the focus here is to maintain response time so that they do not degrade from last year's response time. This is really critical to instill public trust and confidence and making sure that there is a public safety response as crime increases.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's also the Neighborhood Walks program. This is a new pilot program that started in 2021 with the objective of increasing outreach and community engagement with residents, businesses and community based organizations. It's the police officers actually walking in the community and engaging in direct engagement with residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is also the Neighborhood Safe Streets initiatives. This is very similar to the the Neighborhood Walks program where the the officers are on bicycles and it gives them a lot more flexibility to make direct contacts. However, the focus on the the bike program is its focus on the city's entertainment districts, the waterfront and the tourist areas and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'other areas that have been impacted by crime. We also have as a part of this program, a program that's called the Active Bystander for Law Enforcement, or the acronym is able. It's this funding is a match of a federal grant that the police department has received to support this this pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's an initiative that aims to prevent officer misconduct, police mistakes, and to promote general officer health and wellness. We also have the entertainment and business district program. This likewise will support staffing levels and respond to the increased calls for service in the city's entertainment districts and in the business districts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This will address an increase in some of the kinds of activities that have been occurring in those areas, such as fights, vandalism and other disorderly conduct by individuals, including individuals that are unhoused. The next program is the Community Youth Engagement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This includes a city team working with community based organizations and again, funding those collaborations with those community based organizations. And it really is a very it's a rich program where the city teams they they coordinate with to to offer programs such as Midnight Basketball Playground Partners and what they call summer night type programs in partnership with those'",
        "'speaker_8': 'local community based organizations. And this program, the funding covers officers overtime pay to participate in these programs like the Bicycle Program and the Community the WALKS Program. These programs are really all about relationship building by allowing the police officers to interact directly with residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in this program, the last program is the gun buyback program. And this was a council directed program last month that council approved. And this will involve a buyback event that's coordinated by a police department. And I'd like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like to transition and briefly cover the the other programs that are really aimed at the the upstream to violence to prevent violence before it occurs. So I'll briefly walk through these programs. The first of these is the Be Safe program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This program has been offered for the last five years by the city's Parks and Recreation Department. And the funding that's proposed here would expand this program and offer activities for children, teens and adults to enjoy to enjoy summer evening hours and additional locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they already are being provided both in central west in north Long Beach. The next program is the Safe Passage program. This is likewise a violence interruption program. And it is this program is implemented by the health department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it likewise expands upon a program that's already in progress. It provides safety to our residents or youth from gang related crimes against youth and families. And it's really focused on the hotspots that have been identified in the communities to offer safe passage for for for youth in the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And on the other program is the Office of Youth Development. This is a summer neighborhood engagement program. It offers our youths training in civics leadership development in partnership, again with local community based organizations who would receive funding from the city to participate in these programs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'd one of the other particular efforts of this program is the foster community or neighborhood pride in the youth, in areas such as the Washington Street neighborhood, as well as additional neighborhoods in north and west Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A another program is the it's called the increasing funding to to current building youth social capital grantees. Again, a, this is a partnership with some of our community based organizations. This program is already in its currently existing. It would increase funding to the eight organizations in partnership with the city's health department currently.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This funding will expand youth engagement opportunity in these existing work programs. We also have the Teen Center Enhancement Program. Fundamentally, this program expands existing normal operating hours for 16 centers in the community, and it expands those hours from 4 to 6 hours per day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It also allows enhanced enriched programing at these ten teen centers for four Long Beach youth. And we also have the. It's called career exploration. Exploring Space Beach. This funding is a variety of work based learning activities that raise awareness of careers in careers and academic opportunities in space technology and engineering.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With our local emerging space tech partners that they include Virgin Orbit, Relativity and other a new space technology firms that have located here in Long Beach. Okay. I'd like to really briefly summarize the other the remaining programs that are part of their safety recovery plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these are programs, again, that were previously funded by the council approved Long Beach Recovery Act. And there are six programs. Here are the first is youth academic programs. This funding goes to the city library to expand library services and programs for teens.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The Youth Life Coaching and mentoring. This program by the Health Department would establish a life coaching network and mentoring for youth in impacted areas of the city. The Youth Health and safety programing. This is a collaboration of both the health department, the police department, Parks and Rec, as well as community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is a very robust variety of programs. These activities occur in city parks at night. They include midnight basketball, as these are examples, because it's a pretty robust variety of programs midnight basketball, job readiness, life skills, family and teen enrichment and wellness classes and summer lunch programs just to name a few.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, a very robust program that it requires a partnership between multiple city departments as well as our community based organizations. And then we have the the Be Safe program. I talked about that program earlier. This funding through the L we are a enriched that program which is already in operation and this expands that program to give'",
        "'speaker_8': 'it a higher impact in some of the cities communities that are impacted by violence. It provides access not just to the youth, but also to provides family supportive services. We also have the reentry pilot program. This program is to provide services, reentry support for individuals coming out of an incarceration setting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It actually integrates and provides support for mental health services, employment and other supportive services for these individuals that are reintegrating into our community. Then we have a mental health crisis, a response pilot. This funding provides a community, a community responder team that provides responses to calls for service that do not require a police response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These responders are these calls are typically the lower risk calls related to mental health addiction, and they do provide a collaboration with the city's homeless response teams. So that's a summary of the programs, both those that are proposed by.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Proposed as a part of the program. And lastly, I'd just like to acknowledge that, like the city's CARES Act program that was implemented last year and closed out this year, this program incorporates strategies from the city's equity toolkit, and the proposed safety programs will be designed and reviewed through an equity lens to ensure that they reached the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'city's hardest hit communities and those areas that have been most impacted by COVID. The fiscal impact. This authorization is requested for this current fiscal year for up to 5 million and general fund. These costs are intended anticipated to be covered as we discussed earlier under the city's approved Long Beach Recovery Act funds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these funds are currently set aside to cover budget shortfalls and to replenish the reserves for FY 21 and 22. And lastly, all of these funds are one time request and they do not involve any structural enhancements. In closing, I'd like to conclude with the recommendation that the City Council consider the proposed plan, provide input and policy'",
        "'speaker_8': 'direction, and also improve the plan and its priorities to address public safety impacts that the city is is experiencing due to the COVID 19 pandemic. And the final recommendation is to authorize the city manager to allocate, in this current fiscal year 21, the expenditure of up to $5 million in general fund group to implement this proposed safety'",

And that taught me a lot about how much that population have really dictates the quality of life in our communities'",
        "'speaker_6': '. You know, as I look at your at the $5 million proposed proposal, you know, I hear, you know, it's law enforcement working with CDOs. But when you look at look at it's it's the 5 million is 85% law enforcement, 5% CDOs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's that's really misleading because, you know, we have CDOs like Central Cha, where I work for has a track record of public safety. They have a track record of dealing with justice impacted folks and getting those like those violent people, those people in and out of the penitentiaries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's a menace in our society to heal them. So they don't so our our community can heal and thrive. So we need to look at and I heard the second part, there is a little bit of money in reentry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But again, you know, it's not enough money. And if we're going to be community partners, you know, I think that the funding should, you know, be a little more. Equal because everybody that's into, you know, the work that we do, we have a track record of public safety.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'on the street. So community based organizations like this need to see more of the funding to make sure that this product doesn't go to waste and it actually becomes a servant of the society. And I'm just trying to give back.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Two $3 million thrown to police infrastructure, and I see $60,000, $35,000 to youth programs and prevention. It's not fair. That's not how we should be investing, especially after a year. I'm not convinced.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That the police needs this money. You're telling me that crimes involving firearms have increased 60% compared to last year, 2020 a year when almost all people, everyone stayed constantly isolated inside their homes. That doesn't surprise me.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Of all property crimes were cleared. That Martin Luther King Jr. Statue desecration. There's an over 90% chance that that won't be cleared at all. We need to invest in our communities and stop investing in things that don't work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Jesse Johnson. I'm the founder of the 100 Men of Long Beach, as well as the past advisory board member of Midnight Basketball. I want to commend the city council and the chief of police for a successful position.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was a successful program we had in the past. Midnight Basketball basically is a program where we assist and with youth by providing meaningful workshops to empower them and then let them play basketball close to midnight. It's been so successful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thanks to both Mayor Doris Type-C our board and chess ancestrally Walter that we it started here and not about 1995 and there's actually 26 leagues throughout the nation and there's one in London. So again, thank you for this consideration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this program is, again, well needed because it's a fact that when that program was not in existence, crime went up in the area. So, again, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon, City Council Honorable Rex Richardson and all of the council staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Leonard Adams. I am from the sixth district of Long Beach. I am also the ex coordinator for Midnight Basketball. I was in charge of the program for 13 years. So if you heard anything about midnight basketball more likely?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was a part of it. So midnight basketball actually started in another city. It started in the city. Maryland, Glenn Arden, Maryland. It was started up by a city manager. His name was G. Van Standard Sanford. It was started because he started to notice between the hours of 8:00 and 2:00, there was a lot of crime, a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lot of shootings that are break ins, residential burglaries. So he figured out a way how to get those those population of people to be in one spot at one time. So he started by going around town looking for empty buildings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And he found one and he installed some some basketball goals in it. And he invited kids in it. He let them play, just basically have free play. And later on, he developed a program called Midnight Basketball, which we had for 13 years here in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The crime went down about 60%, according to public records. Glenn Arden, Maryland. The program also was implemented by President George W Bush, not George W, but George H. Bush in 1990. He earned the honor grandstand for it and also call it 124 points of life.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if the city is willing to take a chance on our today's youth, I believe that midnight basketball is the perfect tool to have in our community to come back crime and to drive down the violence that has been occurring for the last year and a half.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much for coming next. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To be polite. This plan stinks like a porta potty and it's full of bad ideas and no toilet paper and only five months. This plan spends nearly $2 million on police salaries and overtime for just one investigation team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, 92% of the plans $5 million will fund police salaries and overtime. Under this plan, police will get another almost half million dollars of even more overtime to walk the Washington neighborhood. But the city manager said that with 186 overtime hours, the police made only 300 contacts in Washington.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's one community member every 37 minutes. Steve Urkel could make more friends in 37 minutes. And it's a sad commentary when meeting neighbors requires overtime in a pilot program instead of simply being a part of your job. And then there are the bifocals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city manager admits that an additional half million for bicycle cop is perfect for a waterfront business and entertainment districts. Well, that's just perfect because Mary, Sue, Lee, Roberto and Rex have beautiful waterfront and business entertainment districts. Ideal for bicycle camps.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when I'm done, the city manager will tell you there is a recovery plan for next year. Has plenty of work missing this year. It's not true. Most of next year's money goes to parks and library programs. We hardly have enough parks in the neighborhoods where the shootings are popping up and the library programs are great for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'kids, but they don't work for teens. Choosing between schools and gave one three, five, seven, nine. And the mayor, you're up for reelection. And this is the issue on everyone's mind.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Simms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are my kids safe? Am I safe? And the answer is, hell, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The next five speakers Melissa morgan, Dr. Kim Tiberi, Adrianna Redmond, Jessie Johnson and Caroline Hines. Speakers. Can you please line up? Melissa morgan. Dr. Kim Tiwari. Adrianna Redman, Jesse Johnson and Caroline Hines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we already had Jesse. I don't see Doctor the bar here. I think we just have Melissa and Audrina and Carolyn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right, 90 seconds. Remember these numbers, one 814 zero one. We have one person here, a guy from Washington neighborhood. He's our hope. He's our future. He's and we're fighting for and why we're showing up and staying late and missing our kids for dinner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One eight $8 million. You're squeezing into the police department's budget for fiscal year 21. Do not pass this program. Come on, you guys. Come on. Last year, you hear this? There are people in the street saying defund the police.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What does that mean? Divest, invest, shift your money. Here's a gift thinking caps for each of you to think creatively outside of punitive work. I worked with Chief Luna in the past 15 years ago doing youth and gang violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This has not worked. Using police and using punitive measures does not work. We heard from that one gang. You're telling us you're giving police 8 million more dollars, 14. You want to increase the police budget by $14 million?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's two more health departments. We're saying get money to the health department, give money to Centro to give money to what works. We know what works here. Some sounds slick, slimy, slimy, sleazy, slightly sickening soap opera. That's what this police department's budget looks like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're asking for money at the last minute, squeezing it in. The community has the answers. You hear us coming here? We're passionate. We can come to a principle for a day to have Washington. I live in Washington for a day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'See what happens. Council members see what life is like on the other side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you make speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Audrina Redmon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Resident of District two, BLM and the People's Party Coalition. I'm going to put this here because this says defund the police. This was a cry, a mantra. It is a call for an opportunity for the city to invest in something other than failed policies like the Long Beach Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Specifically, I want to point out and reiterate what other people have said. But I am struck by two things. A couple of things, actually, Abel, which is the active bystander law for law enforcement. Now, why in the hell do we need something like that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Isn't that supposed to be a part of their training already? You're supposed to be able to to. To do policing, right? And to stop your fellow officer when they're murdering people and abusing people, which our city has a very strong record on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm ashamed that something like this has to be put into our budget. I'm ashamed that we have. What is this? The notion of an office of Constitutional Policing. I remember when Chief Luna came in and I went to a couple of his introductory meetings to the community, and I heard him talking about constitutional policing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It sounds like some more B.S. for police funding. There's plenty of money for the policing in our budget, existing 44% or more of our city's budget. We think that 25% of that ought to be taken away from the police department and reinvested into things the community really needs, reinvested into the hopes and and the direction expressed by'",
        "'speaker_5': 'David from the Washington neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's Redmond. Your time is up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm still talking the general fund. This is a guy's is $5 million additional money for the where the police department is is a ruse. It's all a ruse just to give them more money. It is not addressing any of the things the community talked to you about when you got down to those items in the in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in your budget. It was shameful is shameful how little you really care about the things the community was calling for and you're still doing what you've always done, which is hiding behind criminalizing people, which is hiding behind looking at folks as if they are are wanting to exist in the way that they are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I appreciate you. I think we get the point. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Carolyn Christian.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hines and I reside in the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Awesome and amazing District One with the leadership of the unstoppable and incredible memories and day House. As my council member.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am here tonight because I am a alumni of leadership, Long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Beach and as many of my colleagues are here as well. And why are things that we learned about as soon as we completed the process we had to serve. And my first service was with the midnight basketball camp and program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We were able to bring in young men who are not all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Justice involved, not all gang affiliated, but many of them did have needs. They were either service suffering from homelessness or food insecurity. And so the finding we need I'm going to ask I'm going straight for the ask.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We needed to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Provide the program to deliver it to the participants. Midnight Basketball was an amazing program like Leonard already mentioned, but in Long Beach, it was rewarding. It was. It was inspiring and it was definitely effective. My background, I work in Juvenile Justice Coordinating Council in the County of Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm a grip and gang reduction and intervention professional facilitator. I also work with the L.A. Regional Reentry Program, and I started out with the Long Beach Bars program with Operation Shortstop. So our background is to get them in the game, play the game, and then we do workshops.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want you to just know two things. One, we need the money. Two, We are productive and it works. So if you want gang intervention and prevention crime to drop this, we need funding for money for the program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of them just can't they can't even play because they're hungry. So thank you for your time. Thank you, council members and thank you for the money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm asking the Libyans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. All right. So now we'll take the conversation back behind the rail, the making the motion. Councilwoman Allen, your comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Linda, for the presentation. And also thanks to all the folks that make comments tonight. Leonard, I love the midnight basketball idea. And I also want to thank all of our officers who have gone above and beyond in these challenging times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I appreciate you. Our business districts are finally seeing visitor numbers increase and tourism return. They need all of our support to keep their customers feeling safe and secure and to protect their businesses and properties. With firearm assaults up, prohibited possessors out and about, and increased calls for police services and our business corridors and neighborhoods across'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the city. We needed to respond to these serious issues. I will not list all the programs that will be funded. They are in the report, but a few of my priorities will continue to be community policing, entertainment and business district policing, ensuring adequate adequate base staffing levels and proactively targeting prohibited possessors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Youth engagement. And. Violence, violence prevention and in all of its forms. The amazing funding that we're getting from the American Rescue Plan gives us an opportunity to support violence prevention programs and early intervention. I believe we must tackle current crime and implement structural programs to reduce future cycles of crime and violence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The plan. This plan takes an important step towards both of those goals. So thank you, Chief. Thank you, city manager, for your hard work. I will be supporting this item. And Chief, I do have a multipart question for you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can you please describe the reductions in staffing that took place last year in our entertainment and business districts? And and also can you walk us through what additional staffing like bike officers and targeted district staffing might look like?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. Thank you for calling me up. Obviously, this is a very complex issue. Very passionate. Glad to hear there's a lot of passion in this room about it. In regards to the last question, in regards to how the bicycles and foot patrols would be utilized.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's all data driven. Each of our commanders that are in charge of each division participate in dozens and dozens of community meetings where members of the community come forward and they talk about the challenges that they see in their neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We listen. We deploy to those needs and where the where those needs are needed. That's where we would deploy. Regarding last year's budget, we took about a $10.3 million reduction in the police department budget. Which equated to approximately 51 sworn positions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as I have come before all of you on the city council, as we're dealing with violent crime. Almost all of you were looking at all of us in city management and saying, this is unacceptable. We need to stop this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I agree. It's absolutely ridiculous. Our shootings are up. They were up a lot more earlier in the year. Right now, they're up approximately 56%. It's not something we're just seen here in Long Beach. We're seeing it in almost every large city in America.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's an epidemic of violence. President Biden talked about it several weeks ago. He talked about funding more police. But putting more police on the street is not the only solution. So those cuts have impacted our city. And this plan that we're putting forward adds additional officers on the days and the hours and the specific areas based on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'data to keep people safe. And I keep on repeating myself and saying this over and over. We've had 21 murders this year. All but one are people of color. That offends me. Just like I'm sure it offends everyone else in this room.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my job is to stop it. My job isn't to put people of color in jail. I do not believe in mass incarceration. My job, though, is is to stop the people who are using firearms to hurt people in our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I intend to do that and continue to do that. And I see I this is a team effort. We have the best police officers in the country.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Pryce, the second year of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much, Chief, since you're up here. One of the issues that I've been very concerned about is the proposed changes to the air support unit last year. And I'm the one that brought the item to ask us to reevaluate the proposal for last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the Air Support Unit is a really great resource. It's it's not a street resource. It's it's an above ground resource that has a higher a better view, better scope of what they're looking for and is very successful in crime prevention and and crime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Solving crime really can be. I know that the police department issued a memorandum recently in response to the item that I brought to council, but I didn't see that called out at all in the safety recovery plan. And to the extent that we're having these discussions, I would like to see the Air Support Unit continue to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'evaluated in terms of what makes most sense, because if we have to lose patrol officers to put them in the air support unit, that's not beneficial for any of us. And so I want to make sure that that's something you don't have to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I know that August 3rd is going to be the main public safety budget issue of presentation, but that is something that's concerning to me. The other area that I know I've talked with you about and the city manager about is the area of traffic safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm very concerned about the number of traffic fatalities that we've had. I realize it's a different type of violent crime. And I'll tell you, every family member that I have met who's lost a loved one in a DUI collision will tell you it was a very violent offense to them and it was a very violent tragedy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to make sure that we're not forgetting traffic safety. Our traffic division has been reduced over the years, and that's really not allowed for a proactive outreach and education, reminder about speeding, reminders to people about the importance of not being impaired when driving a car, things of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I was disappointed, too, that there was no money in there for traffic as well. So those are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Two areas where I wish we could have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Contributed some more resources or allocated some more resources. I loved hearing from the audience today about some of the programs. I'm involved in several reentry programs and also diversion programs where we work with a lot of nonprofits that the the county and cities support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think those programs are tremendously helpful. I think when you can walk alongside someone who is seeing things and getting support from the criminal justice system, nontraditional support partners and they succeed, that is the biggest reward ever. And to be able to work with people and get them into the trades as part of a reentry program, which'",
        "'speaker_2': 'is something I'm very involved in for folks that are coming out of prison, not jail, but but still it's so rewarding. Personally, it's so rewarding. And so I think those programs are great and I want to continue to support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now we all know not all nonprofit organizations are built the same. So the foundation that an organization like center trial would have is going to be very different than maybe a newer organization. Everybody has to start somewhere. But I think those that have developed a strong foundation for rehabilitation, integration and access programs, I think we should continue'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to support them. And I'm glad to see that there is some support for those programs in the budget. I would love to see more, but of course it's always a balancing act and I look forward to hearing what my colleagues thoughts are on this topic and where that money might move around.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But again, I, I would I would have liked to see a little bit more money for our support and traffic safety, because I think those are two very needed resources that every city should have and in the name of public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That was the motion in the seconder. I'd like to insert my comments here. I want to start with Mr. City Manager. So first of all, thank you for responding to the mayor's request. You were asked to do a public safety centered approach, largely because when we presented the recovery plan, there was no funding associated directly'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the police department or safety. I want you to respond specifically to the claim about the funding being 80, 85% versus five or 15% for community. How would you respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So as the assistant city manager talked about in the presentation, there are two components here. The original Recovery Act had about $3.6 million, and it was all violence prevention work. There was no public safety dollars in that. That wasn't actually an eligible use under the Recovery Act to begin with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That has changed and that has been changed at the federal level to also include safety type programs since that time. But when we proposed it, it was a 3.6 million there. So we heard very clearly from the council on multiple occasions about the need to address shootings and violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that really was our focus. So as we went back and looked at the safety recovery plan, we found the additional resources of 5 million. And so when you combine that with the Recovery Act money that was already funded, which is the longer term violence prevention, and a lot of that money is going to be going out'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to our community. When you put those two numbers side by side, it's about 53% would go towards safety programs in the police department and 47% would go towards violence prevention programs. So I think it's important to look at all of that together as a as a response plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the. What's the timeline on the violence prevention police? Do you anticipate that these all rolled out around the same time?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Fundamentally, the a lot of the work for the Long Beach Recovery Act program rollout is underway. And we anticipate most of the programs that will fund community based support of implementation of those programs, those RFP will be going out within the next 30, 30 to 45 days.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And all of the the various community based organizations that support the basketball programs, the reentry programs and all of those, they would be eligible to respond to the RFP and participate in those programs. In addition, though, the staff has a relationship with a lot of those organizations in the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what we do in advance of submitting the RFP is to to reach out to those individuals to make sure that they're aware that it is coming out and just make sure that they apply if they are interested in receiving that funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And part of the strategy, if I can add, vice mayor, is we're dealing with shooting crises right now. So right now we know we've got programs that need to get funded, especially on the safety side that really is urgent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can put those overtime dollars to use almost immediately. We can react very quickly with our own staff and some of our Be Safe program, and they're just adding more hours to people who are already on the payroll.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our nonprofits, we we really like working with them and supporting them. There is a competitive process we have to go through to make sure that we're allocating dollars fairly. So those do take a little bit longer and those are our longer term strategies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So both will happen. But there is a timing perspective on which dollars we can spend a little faster.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So two, two things respond to that. First, I think we need to do a better job being clear about what people can expect in terms of the comprehensive approach. I think we need to lean in. I'm a big believer in violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some people say it's fantastic. I know that it works upstream and downstream. So we need to talk about we need to when we present this, we need to focus on these are the things we're doing upstream. These are the community supports that we're putting in place or reinforcing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Here are strategies and here's where the suppression comes in. Here's where the Neighborhood Safe Streets program comes in. Here's how we're addressing this. And I think the responsibility is on us as the city to take that additional step and explain that to folks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really want to see more of that moving forward. The second thing I would say is I want to thank all the speakers here, particularly the young man from the Washington neighborhood. I thought he had a very impactful statement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what he really spoke, talked about was investing in youth and investing in youth works personally. Is that and I won't use the example, but my first year in office, there were three incidents that happened right before I took office violence and impacted four young men.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I was I was 30 at the time or 29 before right before I took office. And these three men, they met, I mean, they were very similar, similar age. You know, it happened these incidents happened all in the middle of the day between 12 and two and unrelated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They didn't know each other. But it struck me because I wasn't that far in age from where they were. And I asked myself the question, where was I at 2:00 and during a weekday? Where was I when I was that age?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I was blessed enough to have the opportunity to go to college? Some people were blessed enough to go into the, you know, have a good job or go into the military. And I always ask my question. I ask myself if we did lean in to those types of opportunities for more of those young people or those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'young men in particular, would they have been in that place at that time to be a part of that incident? And I firmly believe that the. More. We invest in them, we can impact their lives and it's backed up by data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You look at the victims of gun violence going back the last decade, the majority of them between the ages of 18 and 29. And that's the age group. They're vulnerable age group. We know where they are, you know where they live.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so if we use that, we we should continue to invest in useful. So I believe that we we certainly the way we talk, the way we walk and the way we invest, we have to continue to invest in youth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's the neighborhood support. But I also know as a council member, there's a lot of time where, you know, I actually, you know, set a budget aside because when bad things happen, they get they need to get a phone call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's community support that needs to happen. You talk to the neighborhood group, you go do a community walk these things on violence happens. It it leaves and it makes an impact on the community. And so our communities want the shootings to stop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are one city team. So there needs to be invested in community and there also needs to be suppression. Police are a part of our city team. There needs to be we need to look at it comprehensively.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so as we invest, we need to make sure we're thinking with left side, right side of the brain. And we're doing we're standing up as one city family. In terms of some of the specifics here, I think, you know, question was raised about the bikes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've been a fan of bikes because we've had bikes in North Long Beach. I just want to be clear that, you know, we have an uptown business district, but even outside of the Uptown Business District, I want to make sure I want to see some bikes on Artesia Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to see some bikes on Long Beach Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue. So so just first question. Can we just be clear that the bike program is not limited to the entertainment district? It's a question. No, it's not limited to just the entertainment areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As a matter of fact, the primary role in the entertainment areas is more foot beats. That's been very effective. It's the foot beats that saved a young man's life when there was a triple shooting at the park about three weekends ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are very effective in regards to bicycles. All of you I know have outstanding relationships with your division commanders. If there is an area where you see the need, you can absolutely talk to that commander. And they will provide that service if the staffing allows.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And, you know, I had a community walk with Commander's Able yesterday and she very much so supports doing doing activities. The next thing is, how can we I know that there's talk about business districts and funding for business district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's both funding in the recovery plan for business districts. How can what I love to see as a part of this is a plan or strategy for each of those business districts. I don't want just P.D. operating in a silo from the security that assessments pay for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's private security there. There are lighting plans. There are September plans. I would really love to see what the strategies are going to be to integrate on the business corridor. Atlantic Avenue. Michelle Obama Library. Artesia Boulevard. Right. Uptown Business, I think, is an example of a business that's very different than, say, the downtown entertainment district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it really requires a little bit of focus. And so that's something that I'm going to be looking for. And the last thing I'll say is, with this with this program, I would love to see how we're going to how we're doing right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's get a report back on the safety recovery plan. We've asked for a report backs on every one of the recovery plans. I think this should be no different. So we should have report backs on how on what the impact the community is based on community impact, positive negative use data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And let's show some some impacts because if these strategies work, we want to stand up and say this strategy worked, this one didn't. And so I think that's incredibly important. So I support what's in front of us today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we can go a little bit further in terms of investment. I'm never going to turn down additional investment for North Long Beach and communities like North Long Beach. I'm never going to turn it down, so we need to continue to invest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I support what's in front of us today. Next is Councilwoman Longo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Chief. You mentioned that your department took well. First, let me go back. Thank you for the presentation. Thank you for staff for putting together the proposal. Thank you for the context that you provided, Mr. Modica. And thank you for all the very passionate speakers and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To to kind of touch on some other topics that my colleagues said before I go into my list of questions. I just want to echo the comments of my colleague, Councilman Price. I remember when I first was deployed to Lakewood Station, my sergeant said, the first thing you do is call air ops.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's worth 18 units on the ground. To be able to cordon off an area in a meaningful way is much more comprehensive and and often results in chases and other high risk things where an air support is just a different tool and having sworn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both in the pilot's seat and calling out all the different things is just a huge asset that I just don't think people know or understand unless you've heard the difference on the radio. And I say the same of dispatch that I've said it in the past and things like that.'",

Prevent chases, prevent all other sorts of things and the be safe program huge supporter of be safe every year as budget chair committed additional funds to be safe and I just believe in it so much and I think that it's a great program that we just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have to continue to invest in. And I appreciate. Councilmember Richardson's continued advocacy for his his areas and his districts. I would just reiterate that we all have areas that we think are important, and I would just hope that we continue to focus on the data that's related to the specifics, because I know that the specific comments I'm'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sorry I'm losing my breath with this mask.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really hard to speak in this mask. I shouldn't have worn burlap mask on on a council night. That the commanders know the data as well. And we just need really responsive data. And I don't know if you're getting the data as quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know the systems used to not be as I know they were antiquated. I don't know what your time lapse is on accurate data, so I hope that you have that to make those decisions. And then I would just my last question was or I guess my main question, Chief, you mentioned that your department took a $10'",
        "'speaker_4': 'million reduction, but I believe you also have a savings target. Do you know what your savings target is this year in terms of millions?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'll have to get back to you on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I think that that's another component of this. I mean, if your department's been asked to save $2 million or $3 million or $4 million, I think that that's just another component of of. Areas where there isn't funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while I appreciate that some of these funds are coming in to target specific programs, and that's great. There's a lot of complexity in your budget, and I appreciate that you're you're working through that. And those savings are critical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had an item that I've pulled from tonight, but you lost 80 officers last year. And you're about to lose another 30 officers this year. And. It's difficult to be a police officer. And the only way that we can continue to grow with the community is by onboarding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'New.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Young police officers and training them well. And so I really am passionate that you have the resources to make sure that your academy next year is funded. And I'd like to see a way that that happens. I know you have savings targets, but I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't see how we move forward without those things. Targets are one thing, but I'd love to see a dedicated set aside of funding that's necessary to restart your department. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, vice mayor. You know, I do appreciate having, you know, this Long Beach safety recovery plan and that there's just so much that's gone on in all rounds of violence, two crimes. And I think as a person who's come from doing youth development and leadership work as well as violence prevention, I think that that, you know'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I believe and I've always spoken about believing that it works and investing in our community. But I also believe that we do have to have a balanced approach to also making sure that when people do want to call the police, that they're there available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. The services are there because I do get residents requesting for these services. And so I think that it's making sure people also feel that they're getting a response when, you know, as far as calls for police, when they do ask for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so I do believe that with the percentage of youth violence prevention and ensuring that we do think about the programing that is coming through the safety program. And I would like Chief Looney to speak to the community policing aspect of these programing, because I'm interested in learning while some of these are pilot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm interested in learning. How has that improved or is working towards or if it's a that's your goal to work towards increasing, you know, the relationship and trust in the community because that's one of the things that has, you know, in the past year demonstrate has been broken.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, I'm interested in learning how how you think these programs are helping to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, ma'am. Council member sorrow fundamentally from the time we recruit our officers and I think many of you and many in the audience, potentially even on television, have been involved in our civil service process when we hire new police officers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you cannot be hired as a Long Beach police officer unless you talk about community policing, partnerships, diversity. That's the kind of police department we are and we've evolved into. So when that's just getting hired, when we train you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Whether it's in the academy, which is six months long, and then another year long program out in the field. Those are the things that we emphasize. So in some of these programs we're talking about now, and by the way, the emphasis is really on partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A police department cannot be successful if it's not partnered with its community and vice versa. You need safety. It comes from both sides, and each and each and every one of our officers is trained that way. The standard is that way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we fall short once in a while? We're human. Of course we do. But I'm proud to say it's probably less than 1% of the time. But in some of these programs we're talking about as an example, our Neighborhood Walks program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can't tell you how many police departments around the country are calling us to say, hey, how did you do this? What did you come up with? And basically what that is, is taking officers who work in a beat.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And remember, we work in police cars because our number one priority is response time. We have one of the best priority one response times in the country. When people die, dial 911. They want a police officer there as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what we did is, hey, how do we connect better with the community? And we tried it first in the Washington Middle School area. We're currently doing it up on the market corridor up in North Division. And it's the officers coming back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And walking that beat so that people know each other on a first name basis. Yes, in a perfect world, if officers had more time when they get out of the cars to do that, we'd love that. But when we're handling 600 calls for service every 24 hours and making at least a thousand contacts per day in a'",
        "'speaker_6': '24 hour period, I know there's been some comments in here, but they're false. They're not real. I can give you the data. And when you're doing that, you don't always have the time. In this Neighborhood Walks program. You have the ability to get out and know the kids, know the parents, vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want the officers to know then I want them. I want each of them to humanize each other. And that's what our officers are doing. And they're doing an amazing job. There's stories of people just hugging the officers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank God you're here. You hear stories of people not liking cops. That's you get out there. And 80% of the people running it who love the officers in their neighborhood, they absolutely love them. So this program so far is working well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We modify it as time goes on because we want that connection that will make us safer. A lot of the programs that have been talked about here in the audience will make us safer. It's a collective effort. It is a balanced approach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And at the end of the day, that's a goal to make our neighborhood safer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Can I add just one thing? I know my time's up, but I just wanted to make sure to do a shout out for them. Midnight Basketball. I appreciate Mr. Leonard and Mr. Johnson being here to share, and I hope that we can kick off the first midnight basketball in the sixth District where it started.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I know there has to be an RFP process, but I'm hoping that will get it in and get it kicked off in the sixth District. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. And they have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, Vice Mayor, and thank you to staff for the presentation and thank you to both of my first district residents, Carolyn and David, for being here and for speaking up and everybody else who provided their their public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to especially thank you, David, for your passion and dedication to our first District youth in our neighborhood, Washington area. I'm very proud to support and help fund your organization, books and budgets, which aims to provide alternative opportunities to our youth in our Washington neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the First District, we continue to face the most shootings and violent crimes. This is why I know it is important that we acknowledge and to work quicker and more efficiently to address these issues of violent crimes and preventative measures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason that we talk so much about safety issues is because we are passionate about that, about speaking up for our youth. We want. Either our youth to grow up in a healthy and safe environment because they are the future and must be a key component of our violence prevention solutions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is why I am a huge advocate and supporter of youth programs that seek to mentor, empower and support our youth to to head towards the best possible path for their future and ours. And one particular organization that is introducing this opportunity to the first district community is, again, books and markets, which I am very proud of'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I think that we need to really. Look at programs that are making a difference in the youth that we have in our communities, like midnight basketball, like books and buckets, and so many other programs that help our community heal and that help a community move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because right now we are going through a lot right now with violent crimes and shootings almost on a on a weekly basis. And it's it's got to stop. And we need to work together to make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. All right. So just looks like that concludes council comment. Just one outstanding question and thank you, Councilmember Mongo, for raising it. Mister City Manager or Chief, what is the status of the Academy for next year?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we are planning for an academy next year that is going to be for F1 22. We do fund that using attrition savings and so we can get you some more information on that. We don't have yet a final amount or when.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you remember, we just graduated an academy in March 2021. We do our looking at attrition rates of probably between 50 and 80 over the next this year that we're going to need to replenish. And so that is planned for F1 22.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. A second question. I know that you're working on and you know, you don't have to share it if you're not ready for it yet. But what can we anticipate? A report on the the paramedic alternative response report that you're working on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's the E.T.A. on that tomorrow? Okay. Well, we'll have to look at tomorrow. Okay. All right. Just so here's what I heard. I heard people want a balanced approach. I think your clarification, you know, 5050, that demonstrates a balanced approach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council member Sorrell said, Hey, residents, when they pick up the phone, they want to make sure that we have a responsive response time that we show up on time. I hear that from my neighbors. I think that's a universal across across the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think you're hearing that data and reporting or response data and accountability and reporting. I think that's a standard. Air support has been raised three times by the council. Investments in the community, we really heard that come out very, very clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we need to lead with that in the future investments in the community. And then seems like Midnight Basketball is a pretty popular program, so we're looking forward to hearing when I can get going. That's it. Thank you all for your comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And members, please cast your vote.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'You know, one of the things that I've shared with our delegation is this idea that Long Beach. We're working so hard to try to meet our housing goals. And there are so many cities that are not taking that approach, and there are many cities that are ignoring the mandates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I wonder if that's possible for Long Beach or cities like Long Beach who are working so hard to expand our housing stock to be exempt from some of these policies or somehow build build an exemption through our work such that if you're meeting the goals or if you're.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Making progress in meeting the goals, then maybe you get a credit so you're not subject to the same requirements or the same state intervention. I don't even know if that's possible, but I feel like we should be treated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Differently than cities that are completely rejecting the reality of housing. And I don't like the fact that we're being all lumped into one, because just in the third district alone, we're producing 10% of the required housing for the city of Long Beach in the next three decades.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would love to see if there is a way that we can advocate, of course, through through discussion at the state ledge committee. But how can we best advocate for Long Beach to either either be exempt or have different standards?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't know. Is that even something that you guys have talked about?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We'd be glad to report back on that and then just share two items with the council. You know, there's a lot of interest in these two bills. We may remember several years back, a bill called SB 35. And there is a lot of concern about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It turns out we haven't had a single SB 35 project in the city, but that bill had triggers. So if you are meeting your Rina, you are totally exempt. If you are meeting certain portions of your RINA, you went on to middle category.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's a model that already exists in other legislation. We can report back about that and then we can also report back separate from these two bills. There is a provision making its way through the legislature called the Housing Accountability Unit, which would hold cities that don't follow housing mandates accountable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know there's a lot of different opinions about that just sharing with you. I think it's a frustration to staff that we invest. Hundreds of thousands of dollars to understand every year all the rulemaking and legislation that comes down from Sacramento and following it to the letter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of our peer cities don't take the same approach, and this would provide staff at the state level to take enforcement against those cities that aren't aren't following the rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, well, that's good. Thank you. So as to right now, does SB nine or ten have those triggers in it, or is that something we might be able to advocate for?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those triggers aren't in in the legislation today. And I'll work with Dr. Carley to see what's possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Thank you. Appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you all at my comments here. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongeau. I think it's the right approach. Hey, let's sometimes the legislation, you'll see a lot of smaller cities will get together and advocate one position or the other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as Mr. Coons just, just stated, we have our own a governor affairs apparatus here and here in Long Beach. I'm a part of an executive board of two organizations that they do that they they look at what's best in general for cities like Skaggs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Their position on on SB nine was oppose unless amended with some very specific things that they requested contract cities this year for one year I'm on the executive board there. Their position was, I believe, the same, I think here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think this approach of asking staff to actually place the lens of Long Beach on the policy and see what's, you know, is there an impact along Beach? I don't see that that the bill actually benefits us very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't see a benefit to it. I think there are things like SB six, seven, nine that will open up the playbook for funding. And years ago we were very, very clear that Long Beach we've done we've allocated, I think, 28,000 units, the Orlando minus element, the spaces there to build our biggest barriers, funding to make housing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'affordable and to incentivize development. The legislature took our biggest tool away redevelopment, where 20% of every dollar will go to accelerate affordable housing production. Specifically, the most important and impactful thing we can get from Sacramento is reestablish a finance mechanism and tool to build and produce housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now that's Long Beach. Now there are issues in other communities, but that's not a Long Beach issue. So I think whatever our position is in Long Beach, it should be proportional to the impact on Long Beach. If is not much of an impact on Long Beach, then we should put our focus on being proactive in Sacramento on'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Let that be known. I'll put a finger on the scale if we need to. But we should really be putting our resources behind the things that we know will actually help us solve the problem, in my opinion. But I think I support this item.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So in response, SB nine builds on the successful approach of current ADU law and expands options for homeowners who wish to be part of the solution in solving the housing crisis. So this bill has a number of safeguards to ensure that local governments maintain control of zoning and design standards, that community character is respected and that tenants'",

And this bill also expands opportunities for homeowners to build equity while also generating affordable units excuse me for working families and seniors, creating new home homeownership opportunities for those currently locked out of the market.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it provides flexibility for multi-generational housing. So as the vice mayor kind of alluded to, that as benign as it's currently in will have little impact on most single family neighborhoods in Long Beach because of the local control components of the bill so as to be nine provides local control over zoning and design standards as long as'",

And in addition, SB nine prohibits the demolition of more than 25% of the existing exterior structural walls unless the ordinance allows a local ordinance would allow that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, it has a tenant. Owner occupancy requirements. So far the structure had been occupied within the past three years. That would be exempt as well or excuse me, protected as well. And I'd like to conclude my comments with the some comments from the Senator directly.'",
