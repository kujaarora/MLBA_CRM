        "'speaker_0': 'I'll give Doug another round of applause for his lifetime of service. Congratulations. Okay. Great. I know we have a full agenda. We are going, like I mentioned before, to the item that most people are here for so we can get them on their way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is going to be item 34. So if I can have the clerk, please read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 34 Report from Economic and Property Development Financial Management Recommendation to enter into an exclusive negotiating agreement with Grand Prix Association of Long Beach for the production of an annual Grand Prix race and associated events District two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We're going to turn this over, I know, to Mr. West, it's a staff presentation. Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members, some time ago, the council directed us to do an RFP to look at the opportunities to continue our relationship with the Grand Prix or potentially to a Formula One race. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our assistant city manager, Tom Modica, who will walk us through the process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. West, Mr. Mayor and members of the city council, we're here tonight to really give the culmination of a tremendous amount of effort and work that has gone in over the the last year or actually a year or two to really look at the possibility of a street race in Long Beach and whether to go'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with an IndyCar type race or a Formula One type race. There's been a tremendous amount of analysis and review. And what we're going to do with you tonight is walk you through the process that we used and talk about the kind of three different groups that we use to analyze the proposals.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're going to hear directly from our outside experts, KPMG, who we brought on board as this is very technical analysis and we needed some outside assistance to make sure that we're fully understanding both of the proposals. We will review City Staff's recommendation and ask for some direction to take the next steps in negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we also want to spend some time to talk about the future potential of the shoreline area. That's something that I believe the council has been very interested in and the mayor has been actually very involved in in leading this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe he wants to make some comments about kind of the future of the shoreline area and the next steps there. So getting into the presentation. I'm trying to get this to work. Pardon me? Here we go. So one to cover a little bit of background, what is Formula One and what is IndyCar?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So Formula One is the highest class of single seat auto racing that is sanctioned by the FIA. Formula One are the fastest road course racing cars in the world. Europe is really the sport's traditional base and hosts about half of each year's races.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the scope, the sport's scope has expanded significantly and an increase in the number of Grand Prix is are held on other continents now. There were 21 Formula One races held in the 2016 season, and those include places like Austin, Texas, Melbourne, Australia, Singapore, Sochi, Russia, Montreal and Canada and many others.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'IndyCar was founded in 1994, and that's the IndyCar Series. And is is the sanctioning body for the Verizon IndyCar Series. The Grand Prix Association of Long Beach currently operates and promotes the existing IndyCar event for the Long Beach Grand Prix, and it has conducted three races and Long Beach for the past 42 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The current Grand Prix event is the largest single street race in North America and the second largest event on the Verizon IndyCar Series calendar behind the Indy 500. ABC and NBC provide comprehensive, live, high definition television coverage of the Verizon IndyCar Series in the United States, and ESPN International has race coverage in over 212 countries of our'",
        "'speaker_10': 'race. The Verizon IndyCar Series has 17 events on the 2017 schedule, and that includes places like Long Beach, obviously Indianapolis, St Petersburg, Florida, Birmingham and Toronto. So I wanted to cover a little bit of the proposals in the RFP process and the process that we use to be arriving in front of you with the recommendation today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we when directed by the Council, the Council really started this process asking staff to look into whether or not Formula One or Grant or IndyCar would be the best fit for a Long Beach. And so having given this direction, we went out and found some assistance in developing an RFP, and our RFP was released on October'",
        "'speaker_10': '5th, 2016. Responses originally due on the 28th, and we allowed some extra time based on the request of the proposers to November 28, 2016. Responses were received by two groups, the Grand Prix Associates of Long Beach and World Automotive Championship of California, or WACC.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Subsequently, two rounds of clarification questions were issued. So we spent a number of months really looking at the data and the proposals and then had some additional questions and issued those questions on May 18th and June 12th to both groups so that both groups could respond to those questions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then each proposal submitted clarifying questions. So we had the responses reviewed by three separate groups. One was our economic and property development staff and our management team. We also brought on some outside consulting expertize as this is a very technical field and we engaged KPMG Corporate Finance and they have a sub consultant apex circuit designed to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'really do that due diligence and analysis of the selection process. And then we also had a third group that was doing interviews with the proposals and that consisted of city staff and some outside specialists in economic development and special events.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the KPMG study really provided for that technical qualification. They're looking at technical qualifications, assessment of technical reasonableness and achievability. They're commenting on economic data, the assessment of financial capability and review of all the financial data that's submitted by both groups in assessment for commercial viability.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They provided a very significant report and that is attached in in your packets for you to review. And also, we consulted with our public safety personnel, our public works and our planning staff on any of the changes or improvements to the city's infrastructure and public safety plans.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We had an interview panel as well that consisted of staff from the Economic and Property Development Department, Public Works and Long Beach Police and Fire. We also brought on a board or a member from our city's Economic Development Commission to help provide some of that expertize.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we also went outside to the city of Los Angeles mayor's office for special events to get an outside view as well. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to our KPMG team for them to walk through a little bit of what they found.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we will follow up with the city staff's recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. My name is Gareth Lee and I represent KPMG Corporate Finance. As noted, the city retained KPMG on April 18th to review proposals received for the city of Long Beach Grand Prix. Following the execution of our agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'KPMG mobilized our team, including the International Expertize of Apex Circuit Design Ltd, in order to conduct our review of the proposals. I'm a I'm accompanied here today by Clive Bone, founder and Director of Apex Circuit Design Ltd. The scope of our assessment was to provide, review and comment to staff on the major area of areas of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'proposals in line with the city's stated evaluation criteria presented in the request for proposals. Areas of focus included economic, financial and technical. As shown, the city stated nine evaluation criteria in the request for proposals, including things such as competence, experience, financial capacity and economic impact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, which I will refer to as GPA, was the incumbent provider. GPA indicated a continuance of a ten and a half day format, culminating in a three and a half day Grand Prix during round two of the clarifications.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both proposer teams were requested to confirm their ability to organize an event in 2019 which GPA was able to do. GPA indicated that they did not anticipate changes to the circuit footprint beyond adjustments for safety and identified that they have Coastal Commission approval for another four years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have an existing FIA grade two license and demonstrated sanctioning body support in the form of a letter from the CEO of IndyCar with respect to potential economic impacts to the city. GPA included an estimate of $40 million in their proposal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, they were unable to produce the report supporting that estimate, and we were therefore unable to substantiate that claim. GPA also provided a detailed schedule outlining set up time and take down times of 16 of 60 and 1717 days respectively.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will now hand over to Clive, who will summarize the Formula One proposal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks, guys.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for Formula One, we had a submission from the World Automobile Championship of California, also known as WEC for Short, who are the bidding promoter for the Formula One race in Long Beach? The wax submission proposes a long weekend of activity, starting with free practice on Friday, qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday with supporting events'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for spectators throughout that weekend. It's interesting that White can't commit to an earlier first date than 2020, and I will explain later about why the circuit will need to be upgraded to host Formula One as the existing IndyCar circuit doesn't meet the minimum track length for Formula One.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So two extensions have been proposed as upgrades, together with more general upgrade to meet the higher safety standards required. And no change to the existing infrastructure can commence without Coastal Commission approval. And we don't believe that work have yet opened a dialog with the Coastal Commission, a process we understand can take two years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Formula One is the highest level of motorsport sanctioned by the FIA, with the international sanctioning body, a French named entity translating roughly to the International Automotive Federation. And the circuit will need to accommodate an FIA Grade one standard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Formula One cars are mandated to run on circuits which have smoother, flatter surfaces, have more energy absorption in their barrier systems, and are engineered to a higher standard than for a grade two standard, which is the current specification for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The process of homologation or being issued with a circuit license by the FIA starts with a full design submission to the FIA Circuits and Safety Commission followed, following which the FIA design approval is usually achieved in a few months and the actual circuit license is only ever issued once the upgraded facility is complete and ready to host'",
        "'speaker_5': 'an event. The sanctioning process with the FIA can only commence once there's a contracted event in place with the city of Long Beach. Concurrent with the design approval process with the FIA, then the World Motorsport Council will need to approve the event for the following year's calendar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hence the claimed inability to achieve an event sooner than 2020. Somewhere in all of this, too, would be the negotiations with the commercial rights holders for Formula One. Neither bidder provided any economic impact analysis to review, and so we can't substantiate the $100 million claim for economic benefit to the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lastly, the submission proposed a quicker set up and teardown schedule than the current program, which is interesting, but probably the result of having a permanent pit structure in place in their proposal. I'll just give you a little bit of a synopsis of the tracks that are proposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I presume that most here are familiar with the existing IndyCar layout, but I'll summarize it briefly. It's entirely temporary in terms of setup. The pit and paddock complex are based in and around the elephant parking lot. The team set themselves up in here and control the race from here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The pit lane, which provides a safe mechanism for access to and from the circuit, uses the northern carriageway of the east side of Shoreline Drive, a road, by the way, made of a concrete slab, something I'm going to refer to later.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The pit lane joins the track, which uses the southern carriageway, a short line drive heading west and turn one. The Toyota turn is a 90 degree left hander opposite the Pike outlets and starts a low speed sequence past the Aquarium of the Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Around the aquarium garage and back onto Shoreline Drive at turn five, a small section of track runs in the opposite direction on the approach to turn six, which is a 90 degree left turn onto Pine Avenue, a very bumpy and cracked concrete surface, and then turn eight takes the track along seaside way, which by the way is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'one of the better sections of Resurface Road before the track, then peels across the elephant parking lot and rejoins Shoreline Drive the hairpin at turn 11 on Shoreline Drive is the final turn before the run to the finish line opposite the pit lane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By comparison. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the submission made by Wack to show their proposed track layout. Norm in this industry would be to submit a 3D computer aided design submission. Even at this early stage in proceedings. So to assist you in understanding our interpretation of their sketch, a handwritten sketch, and the written submission from Wack, we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'prepared this. The track is notionally the same as that used by IndyCar, but to achieve the additional lengthier extensions at each end of Shoreline Drive. So Turn five is now a left hander running west and you hairpin is established after 65 yards before the Queensway overpass and then follows the existing last until the track rejoined Shoreline Drive'",
        "'speaker_5': '. After crossing the 11 parking lot, a new hairpin near Iteration Boulevard intersection is required, resulting in a net increase in track length to just over the mandated minimum of two miles wack identified certain upgrades, namely a fixed pit structure which might be permanent or semi-permanent, similar to that used in the Singapore Marina Bay Circuit or Albert Park'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in Australia. This pit structure is proposed to be 520 feet in length and 40 feet in depth, which would make it the smallest on the F1 calendar. The track would be widened on the approach to and into aquarium wear at turn one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And of course the two new corners which have already been described back, acknowledge that some road improvements are required. And I'd like to draw attention to the fact that all of the track on Shoreline Drive and on Pine Avenue will require re-engineering on one hand, you back to Catholic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can. So in summary, GPI has confirmed its ability to conduct race in 2019 with no changes to the existing format and existing permits and licenses in place. However, it is noted that GPA has been unable to confirm economic impacts associated with the event, while on the other hand has indicated that they are unable to organize events'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in 2019 and based on the information reviewed are scheduled to the achievement of permitting and approvals was not made clear and presents additional risk for the implementation of this option. In addition, the city's financial liability under this proposal is also not clear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While materials were provided and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Reviewed indicating the benefits of Formula One on other regions and economic impact assessments specific to the city of Long Beach was not made available. Lastly, the work proposal includes structures that may limit long term redevelopment and impact city parking spaces in the area.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we wanted to now review and now that you've heard some of the analysis that your proposals city staff is recommending that the Council give us direction to begin negotiations with the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, and we wanted to review some of the proposed lease terms with you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to be clear, you're not approving a lease tonight. You were essentially giving staff direction to go and negotiate. And we wanted to give you a sense of the areas that we were going to be working on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We will work on those planning council direction and then come back to you with an actual one agreement that will be negotiated and ready to be approved. And so those proposed lease terms are in your packing, on the screen and on briefly go over some of those.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It would be a five year initial term with a15 year option at the city's option to extend the term. We would require that all physical improvements to the track be the responsibility of the promoter. There would be a minimum of at least 14 cars to participate in the race, and that race would occur in April unless unless'",
        "'speaker_10': 'otherwise authorized. The promoter will be required to submit a schedule of all the planned races for events for race week which the city will approve. We are also going to be asking the promoter to essentially match the WACC proposal as much as possible to reduce the current set down and take the set up and take down times'",
        "'speaker_10': '. And we would negotiate what that is and of course make sure that it's a time that is also abides by all the safety requirements in addition to reducing that sit down, set up and take down time. One of the things we do want to add is a requirement that the promoter would take responsibility to alleviate some of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the negative physical impacts that we've seen. Those are things like markings on our streets. Your city staff has spent a lot of time over the past year trying to test a number of different solutions to get those marks off the street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we believe we are successful and have now identified one that can safely remove them. So we'll be including that into the agreement. We want the parties to agree on a promotional package to be provided to the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is to help with our economic development efforts. We also want to ensure that we have an outreach program for disadvantaged youth so that they can participate in in the Grand Prix as well. The promoter will pay a race fee, administrative cost reimbursement and all extraordinary costs, reimbursements and lost revenues to the city so that the city'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is not financially on the hook for anything. And we would have no responsibility as a city for out-of-pocket expenses associated with the race. And then finally, one of the things that did come to light during this process is we need some better data on our economics that there is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Both parties really didn't have the type of data we were looking for, for economics. And so we'd be requiring Grand Prix Association of Long Beach to provide an economic impact study that the city would work with them on, on finding a qualified vendor, and then periodically update that so that we have some some real data on what'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the economic impacts would be. So the next steps we're asking for your direction to execute and into an exclusive negotiating agreement for up to 90 days. We hope to be back within 90 days. We would have the ability to have 230 day extensions for any unforeseen circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We would negotiate the terms and others, the terms I just described as well as some others, and bring all that back to you for final approval. And with that, I believe the mayor had wanted to have a little bit of a discussion about some of the kind of future potential of this area and how this fits in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with the Grand Prix.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Murdoch. And I want to just begin, of course, by thanking staff for their extensive review. And I also want to thank I know the council has been very involved in ensuring that this was a process that was open and ensuring that it was also a process that was fair, but one that also, I think'",
        "'speaker_0': ', address some of the needs of the of the city, whether it was around ensuring that we had strong infrastructure and some of the the needs of the business community as well. And so I do want to thank the Grand Prix Association or the folks from F1 that were also involved and everyone that contributed to the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to just also mention a few things. I think it's important to talk as we go into this process and as if the council moves forward tonight and begin negotiations with the Grand Prix Association. There's also been some conversation around the actual site itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just want to say a few brief notes about what is happening when it comes to this this site. So we know that the Grand Prix, of course, also and the track of the Grand Prix is also built around a very large parcel of land that is in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The lot is sometimes called the elephant lot. It's highly used not just by the Grand Prix for that for the event, but of course we know is used extensively by the CVB for numerous events for parking, it's used for events, it's used for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pride uses it for many of their events. So it is a pretty active staging ground for for many of the events that happen in the city of Long Beach. At the same time, it's also an underdeveloped site as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so one of the things that I was I just want to make sure folks know is that over the course of the next few months, I had I've already been and already engage with Councilwoman Pearce as well as the District two team and city staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we will be launching a visioning process for the long term use of that site and the long term development of that site as well. This will also concur concurrently as the city begins to redo the PD six zoning zone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for those that aren't aware with our our zoning jargon, that part of the city is actually called the zoning. A name is PD six and it needs also an update for zoning. And that's since we did the downtown plan many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But PD six or basically south of Ocean was not done. And so there are many partners at the table from our residential community to the Dolby to the CVB and the Grand Prix and others that need to be at the table as part of that process, as well as, of course, the business community and the businesses that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are there along the coast. This is a process and the visioning process. I will also say there will be a lot of interested folks involved. I have assured those who are involved, including those with our current race, that the Grand Prix would be and will be an important player and partner in any discussion about the future of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the site, as would be the other partners like Long Beach Pride and others that use that site for large events. And so I do want to thank everyone that's been involved in that. And I just let you all know that in the course of the next few months, you will be hearing a lot about the beginning early'",
        "'speaker_0': 'stages, which is essentially visioning process to begin having a citywide conversation long term about what we do with the incredible amount of land that is there along the coast of the city. And so I wanted to say that because we've had a lot of questions about that, and I look forward to working, of course, with Councilwoman Pierce'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and the city on that process. And so with that, I'm going to turn this over to the the maker of the motion and the seconder. And then if there is an objection, I'm going to go to public comment or I can go through the whole council and then do public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really up to when we do public comment first. Okay. So why don't we go ahead and go and do public comment on this is public comment for the Grand Prix and for and for this contract. And then we'll come back to Councilwoman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me begin. I'm going to invite first I know that there was a request from from Jim to come up and say a few words first. So if Jim, you could please come up and then we'll do begin public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But thank you very much, Mayor Garcia, members of the city council, city staff. You know, 43 years ago, a unique proposal came before the city. City then was known primarily as a Navy town and it was looking for a way to increase its identity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Long Beach, as the Grand Prix Association was looking for a place to stage a race, a lot of transpired. In the interim. Look at the city now. Dynamic, vibrant, growing. And the Grand Prix Association, too, has grown over those years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has become the largest street race in the world and we're very proud of that fact and it has contributed immensely to the recognition of the city. We are over 183,000 people come to last year's event. Almost 2.5 million people watch the race on national television, not including the international component.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've had a number of accolades from that. The USA Today poll showed that Long Beach Grand Prix event was one of the top ten races in the world. The Washington Post indicated that this was the gold standard of street racing in America, and the L.A. Times and the local press Telegram have also talked about the marketing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'capabilities of the event. But I wanted to take a moment tonight to talk to you about where we see the vision going of this unique partnership into the future. And it really pertains to something that's really critical to us, and that is something we call commitment, because that is really what we represent here in terms of our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'relationship with the city. And for us, the commitment starts at the top. It starts with our ownership. Kevin Keller, Calvin and Jerry Foresight bought this company in 2005. They've been significant supporters of this event and of our company over the years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, Kevin has actually flown in from Florida tonight to be here. And I wanted to take a moment to recognize Kevin Carl Coleman, one of the owners of the Grand Prix. Thank you very much. Thank you to you and Gerry for your continued support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's really important. And the city has in this possession a commitment from Mark Miles, who's the CEO of the Verizon IndyCar Series, to continue conducting their race here as a part of our weekend for as long as we have an agreement between the city and ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we really could have made this event happen if it wasn't for the extremely capable staff that we have at the Long Beach Grand Prix. They have a tremendous amount of experience. Some of them have been with us 20 years, 30 years, one of them who's actually been with us for 40 years, and they know how to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'put these events together and do them in a manner that makes it a really a for first rate operation. I'd like to take a moment to ask our staff to stand up and be recognized. There a great group.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's my privilege to be able to work with them every year. And speaking of commitment, I know that there's a number of activities that take place in this town that we are committed to continuing as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like we talked about the reimbursement of the city expenses and making sure that there were no city expenditures involved in that. And we will continue to do that. We also have made a very significant effort to keep this event as affordable as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Jim, we've got a wrap we're going to wrap it up some time. Okay. Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you take a look at our ticket prices, they're very, very reasonable. And we also have the opportunity for children 12 and under to come in for free, which is really important for us. And we work with the CVB in terms of filling hotel rooms and also working with the stakeholders in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there's one other point that I think is really important to remember, and that is this is a city event. We are part of the fabric of this community. And as such, it's really important for us to be involved in the activities in this in this region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks so much, Jim. So we went over the 3 minutes. I got to keep the 3 minutes to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Okay. Just to wrap up. Go ahead. Let me let me just let me just say that in concluding this really important for us, that we make the commitment. Our commitment is that we will continue to operate a very fan friendly, family oriented festival here in this town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's our commitment to you and to all the residents that will bring them an event that they will be very proud of. And we're delighted to be able to continue that relationship for years to come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks so much. Thanks so much, Jim. Appreciate it. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor Garcia, Vice Mayor Richardson and honorable members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of the city council. Good evening. My name is Peter Santillan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm the business manager, Secretary-Treasurer of Labors Local 1309. And with me tonight, we have several of our members, former employees of the Grand Prix. If I can ask you to stand and be recognized as well. And they're here today in support of the Grand Prix of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of these members have worked, are still working, worked on the Grand Prix this year. We work putting the track together and I think we do a great job. One of the things that I'm really happy about in partnering with the Grand Prix of Long Beach is the safety aspect that they follow that they stick to'",

However, the previous visuals that I just seen, it kind of indicated that there would be a, quote unquote, severe financial liability and an unknown economic impact.'",

And speaking of transparency, why would the Long Beach City Council incentivize this organization to do their own study, kind of outlining what the economic impact would be of their existence in this partnership?

And as you may know, nonprofits struggle with continuing to get funding and the Grand Prix Foundation has been there for us for over 20 years and we really appreciate their continued support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not only do they give us grant funding, they also offer Grand Prix items that we can sell at our auctions and fundraising events. So they've been really instrumental in keeping our program going. I also appreciate the Grand Prix for especially this year.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And Jim, for your amazing leadership and Gemma for holding them all together. You know, the Long Beach Grand Prix does more than just hold an annual race. They do so much for our community overall, and I hope that our city councils will continue to support them for decades to come.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good. You're clear. As he addressed, I moved into Long Beach and Grand Prix Day May 1977. It was a Sunday. And if memory serves me correctly, the mayor then was a unique Seattle mayor of impeccable, impeccable character, cut from far, far different cloth than our current mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I fully support this concept of it in genders dollars, which the city needs. All right. The problem is, of course, the city's management of that money becomes an issue. But we can deal with that later. I'm going to suggest also that when the study is done and I support the concept of having an outside study as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'well, is to consider fashioning the venue in such a manner that the event that took place in the Marine Stadium last year, in the year before being relocated down there along our shorefront, it has clearly outgrown that and it shares one thing with the Grand Prix.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is not quiet. I could hear and people could hear those noises all the way down in Los Altos Shopping Center. And I think having it down in the waterfront area would help tremendously because the buildings themselves was to act as a sound barrier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I believe it's a I think there could be legitimate revenue streams to that because obviously the guys are making some pretty good money on there and so forth. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And with that, Mr. Colvin and Mr. Forsyth, it's one of the greatest things that about the L.A. area. It's a highlight of my year and having been to 27 consecutive ones. It just keeps getting better and better every year.'",

On the other side of it, the international FIA, they want to have market penetration in Southern California. Who doesn't? This is a proven product that we've had for 33 years, since Formula One was once here and then left because of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'financial considerations. It wasn't cost effective for them. I'm going to cut this short.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Sant will be our final speaker, and then we'll go back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, Tom Stout. I think the Grand Prix Association's done a great job for a lot of years. I started attending the first 5000 race a long time ago. I brought many of my students from my auto class here, compliments of, I guess, the Grand Prix and Toyota.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They enjoyed it immensely. It brings in a lot of income to the city. It's if the city were run as well as the Grand Prix, we wouldn't be having as many taxes as we do. So you guys should maybe talk to them a lot more because they seem to stay within a budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a lark, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Asked one of the council people I got one of my bucket list requests was I'd like to have a seat in the Long Beach booth. And obviously, you know, I didn't think that was going to happen and it wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was offered a seat in the section with the people that were promoting Measure A, and since I wrote the ballot argument against it, I just thought that was cruel and unusual punishment. So, Pat, maybe before I expire, I can get that bucket list request.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe you could talk to him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Grand Prix is great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, it's an international event. The only problem is it's so expensive. I mean, that's why it disappeared the first time. You can't afford it. Indy cars, America. Well, at least. Well, I can't say the cars are and I can't say the drivers are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the event is there are a few drivers now, so that's good. But it employs a lot of people to keep it. You know, I never thought you were really serious about going with the the Grand Prix anyway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You've got a proven quality quantity here. Stay with it. Don't screw this up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. We're going to go back to the Council for fair deliberation and comments, starting with Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you so much. I want to thank everybody for coming out tonight and sharing your support or your concerns. An event like this that is such a big deal for our city, not only to the residents that live nearby, but is televised and get such recognition for our city is a big decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to first thank the mayor for our conversations that we've had in the past around visioning for the highest and best use of this piece of land. We want to make sure that as we support the things that we've historically done in the city we're talking about, how do we integrate that into the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City that we're becoming in the future, and how are we making sure that we're doing that in a community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Process that's engaging and so thankful for that process? I also want to thank staff. I know Tom and the team have worked really hard on this and Tosha day and special events when we talk about special events in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I cannot imagine a more logistical challenge than this one. And so I really want to just give a round of applause to all the staff that works not only on the past events, but just getting this together today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're fantastic. Round of applause. They deserve it. I don't want to put on a Grand Prix race, let me tell you. I also want to talk just a little bit about the Grand Prix and what I've got to learn about them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to say that Jim has demonstrated a real partnership with the city. I don't know that anybody in the city has reached out to me as often to sit down and talk about not only this, the event itself, but how they're working with those nonprofits, how they're working with our schools, making sure that they're going in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and talking about science, talking about engineering with our kids, and that they're doing that in as many schools as they can. I think they said almost every school except for maybe the elementary schools. And so really appreciate that real partnership that they have there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a few questions for staff. Can you guys elaborate just quickly for us? How long does it take to set up prior to the event historically and take down afterwards?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So historically it's been about a 60 day prior to the events set up in the current event. And then about 17 days after in the last time that we did the contract negotiations, we heard loud and clear from the council in the community to shorten aspects of that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so there are aspects that are actually open within 24 hours and taken down within 24 hours of the race. So that is something that we have made a lot of progress on. And we're looking for this next iteration to to shrink that a little bit, particularly on the set up time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think we do pretty well on the takedowns time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. And can you share with one other concern that I've heard from community residents? Is the clean up? Is that done by our city employees? Is that done by by Grand Prix or is that done by the bid?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the Grand Prix Association has some requirements to do clean up after the race and with street sweepers and a number of things. I think what you're referring to more is what happens afterwards after they're all cleaned up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They do have a requirement to restore the track to its to its prior condition. But we have had challenges with the street marks that are left on the street. We've been looking to find ways to environmentally or to remove those in environmentally safe manner and also in a way that doesn't degradation degrade date the street.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this year we actually tried, I believe, three different methods to see what we could do. And we believe we finally found one that works. It's actually a pressure washing type of very high pressure to remove those marks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we'll be working on that in the next. We've been doing some work actually in July and finishing up in August and and we're going to build that into the contract so that gets done or there'll be a slurry seal in order to keep the streets looking the way that we'd like them to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you for that. I really have looked through the proposed lease terms, and I think the one that is the most important is that the promoter will provide the city with the economic impact study. And I know there was some questions and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you clarify that that study will be done by a third party?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, it would absolutely be done by a third party. We envision that it would be someone that the Grand Prix Association would go through a process to select and that the city would have a role in making sure that it's an independent third party, that it's a qualified group.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And of course, so we have a lot of the data that they would be looking for, as well as Sebi and others, so that we would be partnering in that in that effort with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. So in that economic impact study, just want to ensure that we're looking at things like ticket sales, attendance, the number of jobs created. I know that there's some discussion about, you know, that we've had a ton of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just had several people here that mentioned that they were on those jobs. So looking at the long term effect for that would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thoroughly support staff's recommendation. I think that we're, you know, at a unique opportunity where we can talk about doing this for the next five years. It's going to take us a while to envision what else we want to see in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the Grand Prix has again demonstrated a strong partnership with the city and as long as we continue to have transparency and we're able to audit the process, it's also, I think, something that is we've been able to depend on the fact that the city isn't at risk for spending any money, whereas with our other option'",
        "'speaker_2': ', there are a lot of uncertainties from what I can tell. And so again, I think this is the best fit for us and I'm really excited and I hope that my colleagues will continue to support us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you. I had a question. I think it was answered, but it was basically relative to the economic impact study. And you answer the question, it will be conducted by a third party. I'm looking over I believe it's Montreal's Grand Prix and their commission, of course, with their convention of convention bureau, as I'm sure we will'",
        "'speaker_1': ', as well as their university. So I think that might be another opportunity as well. I know that's up to the Grand Prix, but just throwing it out there and it includes a lot of information which I think would be really great for us to look at in the years ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that it's a lot of work to pull together an economic impact report, but to do it in a way that really shines not just on the event but on the city as a whole, I think will speak volumes to what we can do in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I too will be supportive of this as well. I do believe that the Grand Prix has been a really great partner as well. Speaking with Jim on and off through the years and being able to just pick up the phone and call you, I know, of course, not only the community events that you drive, but just the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'recognition you give to the city in terms of bringing, you know, the drivers prior to. There's tons of events going on that even other colleagues from various cities and across the regions come to to enjoy here in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's just a wonderful time for us to gather and really celebrate our city in that sense. And I agree, too. I appreciate Ryan, bring the ULI report because I remember this a few years back and how important that underdeveloped land is, especially our underdeveloped land near water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know as we have these discussions, you know, anything that will be developed, I don't see that happening, you know, in the next five years or so. It takes some time. But in that time I know that the Grand Prix will take all of these proposals terms into consideration and they'll do the best that they can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with our recommendations as well. So all to be supportive of this as well, and I thank you all for being a great partner. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excited to continue our partnership with the Grand Prix of Long Beach. The great things that you do in the community are felt by many. I know that this year, particularly with the heightened awareness related to this RFP, it really got people's ears open and eyes open.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that a lot of things great came out of it. I'm was excited to see the zip code breakdown of who in our own city are purchasing the tickets. I think that it's important for the community to recognize how big of an impact the Grand Prix has, not only on the region but on our neighbors'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so with that, I also hope that as a part of your economic impact study that we receive a yearly report on who's buying the tickets and what zip codes are they from. It's important that people from outside the city buy those tickets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hopefully they're from far enough outside the city that they also reserve a hotel night and so that we can continue to grow that economic impact through utilization of our hotels and our local restaurants. And then hopefully the East Side hotels that are also filling up to the brim will be able to work out structures by which we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'help get people downtown, or at least to the blue line to bring them into the community more effectively. For one, I was looking at dates to book my wedding, and when I went to pick a date, the first thing I said was, When's the Grand Prix?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because our hotels do fill up. And we ended up moving at one week earlier just to make sure that if our family was in town. From Colorado that they'd be able to stay and experience something big for a long beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I appreciate you and I appreciate the name. It's brought to Long Beach. And I also look forward to seeing continued opportunities to feature the Grand Prix in the community at events so that the community year round can remember what a great asset it is and to hold that date a year in advance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I echo a lot of the comments of my colleagues. I think I appreciate the work that went into this process by staff and the education by KPMG this evening regarding the process. And I think both of the RFP has presented some great opportunities and things for us to consider.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have done an extensive amount of research on this topic and I feel very comfortable supporting staff's recommendation this evening. I will say I do have and I want to thank the Grand Prix because over the years they've really integrated into the Long Beach community even outside of the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we're exposing a lot of our residents to the Grand Prix event and auto racing in general by virtue of the Grand Prix actually going into the communities and introducing folks to the sport of auto racing. And I think that's fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you. I'm encouraged to hear about the visioning process that we're going to be starting. And I'm I'm assuming from what I'm hearing tonight that this is going to be a process that's going to be parallel, moving parallel to us entering into this contract and entering into this new agreement, such that in five years, we have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the opportunity to not only look at what development in the area could look like any recommendations, and then be prepared to implement any of those recommendations. And I don't know who on staff could maybe talk to the timing of a visioning process for the downtown area for this space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there someone who could talk to us a little bit about the timing and what we can expect in terms of this visioning process?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, Councilmember Price, I can give it a shot. We don't have a specific time yet where everything's laid out, but what we envision, we've actually already started. What one of the major things we need to do is this is one of the most complex parcels that we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's got convention center uses on it. It's down in the coastal area. It's state lands, has a role down there. We have a lot of events on that space. So one of the things we're doing right now is going through an analysis of what is what are the encumbrances, where are the opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is obviously the site also for the Olympics that we've chosen in 2028. And how does that factor into it? So we imagine that's going to take a couple of months to really dove into all the operating agreements that we have for that space.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Then we do want to kind of identify for the council what a visioning process could take and and how long that would take. And if there is financial resources that need to be dedicated, we want to start kind of on a on a low cost, obviously, to to start generating some of those ideas.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then as the visioning gets nearer and nearer, then there's other steps that would happen, such as updating PD sixes. The mayor mentioned, updating some of our zoning documents. So it would be a longer term process, but we would have some information back to the council fairly soon in the next couple months on kind of what that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'what the constraints are, what are some of the opportunities and then how we would move forward with the visioning process?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, that's encouraging. And the reason I asked that question is because it is a lengthy process and we have a five year window to get ourselves in a situation where we're looking at opportunities and actually planning for implementation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Should we decide to do something different after that five years, should the sport of racing change in terms of trends, I think we should be in a position where we have data and some clear recommendations in terms of where we're headed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think that's really important and I appreciate that that we will get updates on this as we move forward so that at that five year mark, we're able to make some decisions. I was impressed by the construction period and the proposal by wack, so I'm hoping that we're able to make that a priority in our negotiations'",
        "'speaker_8': 'because I do know that that's something that Council has articulated very clearly, is an issue for our businesses in the area and our residents, of course. So to the extent and I heard Mr. Rodak, I heard you say that that's going to be something that we're going to try to impose some priority on during the negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So to the extent that I could underscore that, I would like to do so. And I think that that's an important one. But but beyond that, I think staff for the recommendations and all of the folks from the Grand Prix for being here too tonight, for your support throughout the year and for integrating auto racing into our'",
        "'speaker_8': 'communities in a way that's. Very positive. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dear Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I'll also be supportive of staff's recommendation. I think the Grand Prix is of Long Beach, is truly part of our city's DNA, our identity as much as the Queen Mary is in many ways. When people across the country think about Long Beach, the Grand Prix is one of the the points that that is also'",
        "'speaker_3': 'often raised. You know, I think it was mentioned that and I didn't know that we were the second largest IndyCar event in North America next to the Indianapolis 500 and the largest streetcar race in the country. I thought it was actually in Detroit, but that was my first experience to a Grand Prix.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I did have some some questions and I'm encouraged to hear that as we negotiate this, Indy, that there will be emphasis on economic impacts because I think, you know, the $40 million of income on comic impact that's presented and represented by the the Grand Prix along beaches is great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm interested in breaking that down and understanding how that is measured and how we can grow capacity in that regard and improve that economic impact if possible. And the same thing with attendance. All right. You know, I think the number has been thrown out that there was 183,000 participants and fans who enjoy the Long Beach Grand Prix'",
        "'speaker_3': '. That is an impressive number. I want to know how we arrive at that number. I'm interested in knowing the methodology and again, how we can improve the capacity in that regard as well. And so I think the economic impact of study is something that I think is very important in terms of this negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, I will be extremely supportive of this, I think, and I look forward to attending the next Grand Prix. I haven't missed one in many years. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Wawrinka.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. My late father in law was a great, great fan of the Grand Prix, and I think he would kill me if I didn't support decision. But speaking of the Grand Prix and I know that there was a lot of study that went into it and obviously the feasibility of one versus the other came'",
        "'speaker_9': 'down to what would be the best race that we could have with the conditions that currently exist. What are the points that came out here that really stood out? Was the immediate availability of the Grand Prix to put out put on a race and the inability of the other or the wag to put on their race and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not until 2020. And with that, the additional changes that would need to be made, such as extending the track and adding some other improvements to to the race itself. One question, I don't know who can address this, but does the Grand Prix have any permanent fixtures in the race that those that might last see that go up'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for the race but then stay up there for the next race the following year? Are there any permanent structures allowing the race round or anywhere for the Grand Prix?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, we don't believe that there are any permanent structures. It's essentially going to be the proposal that you see today, which is temporary. It gets put up and it gets taken down. That being said, there was a potential in the back proposal for a permanent structure or it could have been temporary staff looking at the size of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it, kind of deemed that it would likely be a permanent facility, which of course would get into the council commission arena and really have to start looking at the permitting process for a permanent facility.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, and that's what led to this question because I was looking at the at slide six in the what you gave us here, there are some proposed buildings, I guess, that would be there that would be permanent and a bit on the north side of the track, which would basically be on a year round basis, interfere with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the view shades of people who come down to the beach and those structures be there and just interfere with the views to the beach. So, I mean, that that was something that I would not be able to support even here for, let alone it and the Coastal Commission, because the effect that it would have on view should'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and that is to the next question as well as in church. When we look at the at the at the visioning that we keep that in mind that the the current structure of the race is such that it's used for what is it, about 60 days in and 15 days after I guess, or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And. Then it goes back to normal. I mean, it's it's like you wouldn't even know that a race was held there until the following year. So, I mean, I love that. I love the fact that we're able to hold a race, bring in a couple of hundred thousands of people to enjoy it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then once it's done, it goes back to to normal, to being to be what the Long Beach offers, which is a great view of our ocean and a great opportunity to wine and dine and enjoy all the amenities that Long Beach has to offer along the shore.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So in looking at this, I hope that it's not an issue now, but maybe we should put it on paper is a fact that hopefully during the negotiations that we can include in there an item that would that would restrict any structures being put up along the race that would be permanent in nature.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because I would like to have a permanent opportunity for us to put up and take down and return our, our shoreline to to its existing in 16 forms. So that that would be if if it's needed, fine, if not fine, too.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we won't want to memorialize that just so that we have it on paper, so that in the future, should there be a request to have a permanent structure put on there, that it would fit certain criteria, that that would not infringe on our views alone, of course, in long shortly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Just very briefly, I wanted to ask staff and I'm not sure if if Tom or John would like to answer this, but if it proved tonight, can you tell us for the next 90 days, will there be a two from four member come back to us where there were other milestones that that council should look'",
        "'speaker_6': 'at over the next 90 days?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'll start with that. We are envisioning going fairly quickly. Hopefully we're spelling out and it's helpful to get the council's input on those terms right now so that these are essentially going to be the major terms. We would sit down for 90 days and work with our partner and then we would come back with a council'",
        "'speaker_10': 'agenda item. If at the end of 90 days, if we're not going to hit that mark, I don't think there would be an issue. But if there were an issue, we would do a two from four memo and let you know that we're going to need to extend by 30 days or 60 days and give you an'",
        "'speaker_10': 'update of where we are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. And Councilwoman Mongo mentioned the impacts on the east side of town with the hotels. And I can tell you that the association got us on IndyCar before the race in April and we parked in front of Joe Joe's and took a picture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as of tonight, they've got 927 likes and a 97 share. So it's a popular item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to chime in and say I know a number of cities would love to be in this position, to have two world class races competing and come into our city and the opportunity to go ahead and further develop more opportunities in our waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we should just take a moment and just acknowledge that as a city, I think I want to start with just thanking the Grand Prix Association and all of the family that is associated with them for conducting themselves in a way that the city staff feels comfortable making this recommendation to the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to say thank you to the grant to Formula One for expressing this interest and coming through this process and allowing us to sort of test our mettle a little bit here. And I and I would say I think this is a smart approach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This five year agreement with the option to extend because it allows us to conduct those that visioning about the highest and best use of the area and allow some options to be placed on the table for the city council in the years to come for some flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So to all the players, all the stakeholders. I look forward to many more fantastic races. You know, I've probably been to three or four of them, so I'm pretty new compared to people who have been going for, you know, I've heard, you know, 20, 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But but we have a fantastic time every year and we get to know more and more people. And I brag about it more and more every year when I leave our city. Have you been to our Grand Prix?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I feel pretty embarrassed. My first three or four years living in the city, I never I never I had never attended. So I think many more people are going to continue to discover this Grand Prix and what it what it really the way that it really demonstrates and showcases are our downtown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks a lot and obviously has my support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and go to a council vote. So, members, please go ahead and cast your votes on the motion in front of us, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. And of course, to Kevin, Jim, the association, all the incredible volunteers and community members. Just thank you for your partnership with the city of Long Beach. We look forward to many more years with the race and to our partnership in many other ways as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just thank you to the team and I thank you all for being out here. We're going to transition to the regular agenda. We I and this is I know an extensive agenda. We actually have three hearings that we have to go through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you're not here for one of the hearings, I do apologize. This is a long a very long agenda. And so if I can ask everyone, this would be a good time to exit if you're not here for if you're here for the Grand Prix.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're going to go into our three hearings here in just a minute. So I'm scared. Just I'm going to restart in just one minute so people can exit. Okay. One minute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bring us that. No. Okay, Kelly.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'For their consideration. And we're here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To answer any.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Questions. And we have our team and experts here if there are any technical questions that council members would like to ask. But we believe that the written record can speak for itself and we agree with staff's presentation. So I'll hold my comments and interest everyone's time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So you want to. So you're deferring your time or you're done. You're good. Okay. Thank you. How about the appellant? Please come forward and you have 2 minutes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Thank you, City Council. I'd like to reserve 3 minutes of my time. It's only fair that if there's a rebuttal that I would get to respond to the rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Up to the city attorney. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, generally we don't allow someone in this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Particular position to reserve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Their time. The reason the applicant gets a rebuttal is the applicant actually has the burden of proof here to establish under city council that this project merits going forward. And that's why they get the last word.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Understood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, that's not how Mayor Garcia has previously run these. I'm going to always let there be a rebuttal time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, thank you. Considering that the applicant. You only spoke for about 2 minutes, I think this is fair. So I'm going to just defer to the city attorney's advice. So you have 2 minutes and we'll start your 10 minutes with you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Warmed Lisowski. Long Beach Citizens for Fair Development. The reason that we are bringing this appeal is under California Environmental Quality Act. And I understand that staff has instructed that there is a downtown plan, also known as a programmatic air.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there are many exceptions to a programmatic air. And staff was referring to the tearing of square tearing can be used and is being used in the situation. But when there are certain substantial, even mitigated effects that does not allow further environmental review to be completely avoided.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this project sits directly across the street from the George to Deukmejian courthouse, which is 63 feet tall, and this proposed project is 84 feet tall. So it's a full two stories higher than the courthouse, and it also sits to the south of the courthouse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know if you've been in the courthouse in the main lobby, but there's a great amount of light that comes in. It's a vast improvement over the original courthouse, and this building is going to tower over it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you look at all of the renderings that staff has created and that the developer have created, none of those renderings show the courthouse and the development in relation to each other. So really what you're going to have is this seven story building really kind of dwarfing that beautiful new courthouse that we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another issue is they're proposing to only use the existing curb cut. There's only one curb cut on Magnolia Street and Broadway, Ocean. And seventh and seventh are the six are the only major entryways from the 710 Freeway into downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, you know, this downtown plan, this council envisions this beautiful pedestrian interaction between the courthouse, the Civic Center and these other downtown Long Beach areas. This is going to this should be a major vital pedestrian intersection. Putting a seven story building there is going to significantly reduce the visibility for both pedestrians and vehicular traffic and the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'parking these these right turn only parking strategies. We all know when we leave parking lots in downtown, there might be a sign that says Don't turn right, but most people turn the way that's more convenient for them due to the one way nature of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the. Of most of the streets in downtown. I apologize for boring the city council, so I'll try to try to make it interesting and short here. So the downtown plan was the programmatic air was adopted and in the draft air it stated that further environmental review might be necessary to examine whether there are project specific significant'",
        "'speaker_3': 'effects which are peculiar to the project or its site. Our position is that this is a peculiar project site being on this intersection right near the new civic center, right across the street from Deukmejian courthouse, as well as the major entryway that Broadway is from the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This creates a situation in which this is a unique or peculiar project site. Also the program E.R. promised that further environmental review would be done and that this planning, the planning commission, as well as this body, continue to approve projects inappropriately using negative declarations or exemptions from seek that are not appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. Here's some of the. Some of the unique things about this site are the esthetics. I've already spoken about the courthouse being an award winning, glass walled building. That's part of the pride of our Superior Court district here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've also talked about the traffic, about the ingress egress on Magnolia, and that the Broadway corridor is a vital part of vehicular entry to Long Beach from the 710 Freeway. The population and housing? Yes. The downtown plan calls for high density housing, but every week we read about pedestrian deaths in our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you can only imagine that these pedestrian deaths are caused by gridlock and driver frustration. We've all driven down Seventh Street before. We've all driven down Broadway. These are narrow streets. If there's a bus in front of you and there's pedestrian stops, many cars lurch out and these lead to pedestrian deaths.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've all driven down Pine Avenue before, and I've been told by parking staff that they are specifically instructed not to ticket commercial vehicles. So tell me about the intersection of Broadway and Pine. Where you've got an unsafe, an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing and you've got multiple commercial trucks parked in the middle of the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's just one of these days before a child or a pedestrian gets into an accident and gets hit by a car that they can't see around. So these overly dense parking, these these are the reasons that this project deserves an environmental review.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The environmental documentation that the city and the developer have chosen to use is an exemption. It's not even an initial study. There's no negative declaration. There's no mitigation. It's just simply an exemption. And the Class 32 exemption that's being used in this case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'States that if there's a reasonable possibility that there's a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances, then the categorical exemption cannot apply. So once again, we find that staff and developers work together to back in to these environmental reviews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when I say back in, I mean I get the result that you want, which is we don't need an air. And then let's figure out how to make every single line of our report match so that there's no environmental review needed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we've got the unusual circumstances. I'm going to use my last 3 minutes since Mr. Vice Mayor said I can't use it later. Let's talk about guest parking. The downtown specific plan changed the parking ratio for from one per unit plus to a quarter of a space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For guest parking. I don't know if anyone on the council and Mr. Vice Mayor have used any of those combined guests and commercial parking. But they fill up quickly. They fill up fast. And there's nothing there's nothing that keeps long term guests from occupying those spaces that are supposed to be commercial.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know if you've ever been to Pet and Pooch, I believe it's called or the Stav bar on the promenade and you try to pull into the alley there. There's only one egress, ingress, egress on a small alley.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The name escapes me. Liberty Court, possibly. And. And very often all those guest spaces, those commercial spaces are taken by long term guests or residents of those buildings. So we do not feel that these dual use guest and commercial use spaces are appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're going to have commercial on the first floor, then you should have the appropriate number of spaces for commercial as well as for the guest spaces. Those should be unique parking spaces for each of those two groups, not overlapping as they now are being approved very often both commercial as well as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. So once again, what we're asking for and we will continue to ask for is that when there's a programmatic E.R. that's been passed, that this body and the planning commission insist that the developers follow the California Environmental Act, the reason that environmental reviews there or is to create a period in which citizen citizen input can be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'made. The problem with using these negative declarations or exemptions is that there's we're only limited to 3 minutes of public input when there's an E.R. The law gives many opportunities for the public to interject. And so by using this inappropriate exemption, you're depriving the residents, the citizens of Long Beach protection under the Environmental Quality Act.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for your time with the applicant. Like the rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Damon. Mama like us from Armbrister, Goldsmith and Dell back on behalf of the applicant. Just like to so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a moment. Let's set the clock to 3 minutes and if you need an additional two, well, we can go up to five, so 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll make it short. I'll try to keep it within the three. Thank you. I'm just a couple of points to address that the appellant has raised and I'm sure staff will address them as well. First off, upon further review of the appellant's appeal, staff determined that we no longer needed to pursue a categorical exemption under sequel, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'rather as allowed for under the school guidelines. We were able to do environmental analysis under the programmatic air for the downtown plan. And despite appellants claims, additional environmental analysis was done specific to Sequoia. That went.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Through all of the issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That are raised, all 18 impact issues that are raised under Sequoia to determine whether or not there was something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unique or peculiar to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This project. And the record contained ample evidence of that, not only including environmental analysis by our Sequoia expert, but also technical experts as well. There's a shade and shadow study, for example, that looked at the courthouse and the near sensitive receptors and determined that there would in fact be no shade shadow impacts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As to traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And ingress egress. That was also subject to a very thorough traffic study. And again, no impacts were determined. Nothing unusual, even if we were to be under a categorical exemption, was there. And there's nothing peculiar about this quickly under population and housing, as was already represented by staff, this project is smaller than what is contemplated under the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'downtown plan and is fully sufficient with it. And finally, even if one were to look at the categorical exemption and determine whether or not there were unusual circumstances, it's not enough to show that it's appellant's opinion. There's something unusual here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rather, the test is unusual circumstances leading to a reasonable possibility of a significant impact. And as I mentioned, the record contains a full environmental analysis that shows, in fact, there is no reasonable possibility of significant impact. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for your time. So that concludes the hearing. So at this point, we're going to open it up to public comment. Is there any public comment on this hearing? Number one. Thank you. Please come forward. State Stage Name.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Laurie Angell 458 He's quite straight. I think what's missing here probably is a fair evaluation of a plan as it's maybe morphed or changed over time, and to give the individuals that may have changed over time because the planning process can take decades.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so you have individuals that find themselves all of a sudden in a development that they had no input on. And they're astounded by the magnitude of the of the development that's going to occur. And they're not given any opportunity to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in terms of fairness for the individuals that actually live there, it really isn't a very considerate process. And I think it's important that people that have moved into neighborhoods have an opportunity to weigh in on projects that are going to impact them, possibly for the rest of their lives.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'that are experiencing an increase in crime. This has been a very useful tool over the years and has proven successful in improving safety in our community. As proposed, we will receive $900,000 in general fund one times to be used for discretionary overtime.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will help support overtime for our Investigations Bureau to clear cases and other initiatives such as the Hazard Incident Management Team. The police department is also grateful to receive measure funds to support police recruit academy operations in Fy18.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will hire a recruit class that brings us to maximum capacity. We are excited to hire a larger than average class size to help with our staffing needs. In addition, we will receive Measure M.A funds to support drug recognition, expert training for patrol officers and overtime for short for sworn presence at the Civic Center.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Metro contract will add a total of 28 sworn and civilian positions to the Fy18 budget and will be assigned to the field and administrative teams for the new Metro Transportation Section. The police department will also convert several clerk typist positions into analyst positions, furthering our objective to be more data driven.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To be a more data driven organization, and the department will convert an administrative sergeant position into two civilian positions in the community engagement division as the department looks ahead. There are a few challenges that I would like to point out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Although the principles of policing remain consistent. Our environment has undergone significant shifts that will redefine police filled investigative and business operations. We are all fully aware that homelessness has been a challenge citywide. The police department continues to support the Health Department, our health department to impact homelessness by implementing creative solutions with all of our city and community'",
        "'speaker_7': 'partners. Also, increased workload demands have constrained our ability to undertake initiatives outside the police department's scope of core services, such as additional quality of life officers. We understand and support the city's efforts to attract and promote special events.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, the growing number of special events continues to be a challenge for the police department. Planning and staffing. From a staffing and planning perspective. Criminal justice reforms also continue to negatively impact public safety. And we continue to receive unfunded mandates for technology, mental health training, as well as procedural justice training, only to name a few.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition, the continued use of aging facilities and technology infrastructure, including the police academy facility and outdated records management system, continues to be a challenge. Our body worn camera pilot program will continue or will come up to an end in November.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will be reviewing the results and exploring our options. We look forward to presenting our findings over the next several months. So far, we have learned that body worn camera technology is complicated and requires a huge investment for any city that chooses to fully implement this program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, despite these challenges, there are several opportunities are available to the police department allowing us to better address contemporary public safety issues. We are currently evaluating field operations to maximize swarm presence in our community. Specifically, we are researching various models that would limit patrol officers from transporting and escorting inmates to obtain medical care at hospitals and clinics'",
        "'speaker_7': '. This would free up patrol officers to answer calls for service, as well as providing more time for proactive policing and engaging our community. I also wanted to highlight that our department has been working closely with the city's innovation team to research police operations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This partnership has allowed the city to identify opportunities for intervention to help reduce repeat criminal offenses in our city. With their help, the city has implemented an administrative regulation which will permit data sharing between city departments to address high utilizers of city services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Additionally, we are in an ongoing participant to the Data Driven Justice Initiative in collaboration with the Technology and Innovation Department. We are developing a strategic technology plan to identify best investments in public safety technology and software applications. In Fy18, the police department will begin the RFP process for a new law enforcement records management system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will ensure the department meets the FBI's updated federal crime reporting requirement. It will also assist our efforts in being compliant with AP 1953, which will require us to collect and report specific data to the Attorney General regarding all of our stops.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In closing, the police department will continue to build public trust through a number of efforts which coincides with our mission of public safety through partnerships with your assistance and support. We will continue to expand our technological capabilities. We will employ a data driven approach to our enforcement and investigative strategies to maximize our resources, reduce crime, and improve'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the quality of life. We will continue to address violent crime increases through a variety of initiatives, including our continuing support and participation in the city and in the city's public safety continuum violence prevention plan and working with our city's innovation team.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This concludes my presentation. We will be available to answer any questions after my partner, Chief Terry, makes his presentation. He's currently staged and ready to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Chief. We're going to get our other chief, the great chief, to load up the presentation. And then once we have both presentations, we'll go into city council. Questions or comments?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, members of the city council. This evening, I will be giving you a brief overview of the Long Beach Fire Department's fiscal year 18 proposed budget. My presentation will also touch upon services provided by the Fire Department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Some of our key accomplishments for the current fiscal year. Notable changes in fiscal year 18 proposed budget and some major issues and opportunities that we foresee in the upcoming fiscal year. The Fire Department delivers fire rescue, emergency medical services, marine safety response, hazardous materials response, and non-emergency response services to residents, businesses and visitors within the city of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Long Beach. We provide 24 hour operation for which all first responders must be prepared at all times. Additionally, we work to ensure the safety of the community and to prevent fires through proactive fire prevention and code enforcement programs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we also provide training and education that is essential to the delivery of our core fire and rescue services. I would now like to outline some of the fire department's accomplishments and highlights for the current fiscal year. Over the past 12 months, we've responded to over 71,000 fire, emergency medical services, marine safety and other emergency incidents.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This equates to more than 150,000 individual unit responses. Included in this number are over 51,000 medical calls and over 5700 fire calls. This number also includes hazardous materials responses, airport responses and other non fire responses. A major highlight of the current fiscal year has been the restoration of fire engine eight in the Belmont Shore area and the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'restoration of Rescue 12 in North Long Beach. These restorations have improved the department's fire and emergency medical response capabilities citywide and would not have been possible without the Long Beach measure. A funding excuse me. We also continued our multiyear multiphase plan to address workforce privacy issues throughout our facilities, working in partnership with public works and utilizing capital'",
        "'speaker_11': 'improvement funding. We are completing improvements at three of our fire stations this year stations to Station ten and Station 22. With one time funding from the City Council, we implemented a new and innovative program our Homelessness, Education and Response Team, commonly referred to as our Heart Unit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This team is comprised of two firefighter paramedics who work closely with the city's continuum of care partners, including the city's Department of Health and Human Services, to assist individuals who are experiencing homelessness. This program has been highly successful, and as you'll see later in this presentation, the proposed FY 18 budget provides resources to structurally fund this program'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on an ongoing basis. Additionally, our Fire Prevention Bureau actively managed and participated in 512 film days and 450 special events, doing our part to enhance the city's reputation as a destination for special events and filming. Finally, for the first time ever, we conducted two simultaneous fire recruit academies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This was a tremendous undertaking by our training staff and was highly successful as we graduated 39 new firefighters. The proposed fiscal year 18 budget for the fire department is $116.9 million. We have a total of 528.91 full time equivalent staff consisting of 403 sworn Ph.Ds in the fire ranks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Another 27 full time year round marine safety first responders, over 180 seasonal lifeguards and 26 full time ambulance operators. Additionally, the fire department is supported by a civilian staff in fire operations, support services, fire prevention and administration. 74% of our budget is in the general fund, which supports most departmental activities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The proposed Fy18 General Fund budget for the fire department is $86.6 million. The Long Beach Airport provides support in the amount of $5.3 million for fire and rescue services provided to the airport. And this is included in the fire department's general fund budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, the Tidelands Fund supports marine safety activities as well as our fire operations in the Port of Long Beach. The Harbor Department provides cost reimbursement for the services provided in the port in the amount of $18.5 million, and that's included in the $27.4 million Tidelands Fund budget for the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Proposition H from the Oil Production Tax continues to provide additional support for fire staffing in the amount of just over $2 million annually. And along with the Health Department, the fire department content provides environmental protection services that are supported by the Cooper Fund.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This stands for Certified Unified Program Agency and through permit fees, it provides funding for inspection services and businesses and business emergency plan reviews to ensure hazardous materials and hazardous chemicals are handled, stored and transported in accordance with current state and local standards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Fire Department's proposed fiscal year 18 budget includes several notable changes that I would like to highlight. First, as I mentioned earlier in my presentation, this proposed budget includes the resources to structurally fund the Homelessness, Education and Response Team or Heart Unit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The mission of the Hart team is to reduce the number of fire department responses to individuals experiencing homelessness through rapid response to 911 calls for service, collaborating with our continuum of care partners, and educating the fire service and community members about issues surrounding homelessness and available resources.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'By all accounts, this has been a very successful program and we look forward to continuing it on an ongoing basis. Therefore, 18 budget also includes funding to add a battalion chief in the Fire Operations Bureau. This additional staff person will give us the subject matter expert who will be responsible for managing the fire department's 26 facilities, providing'",
        "'speaker_11': 'supervisory expertize and testing, procurement and inventory management of equipment, and providing consistent oversight of specialty programs such as urban search and rescue, hazardous materials, airport rescue, firefighting. The proposed budget includes additional staff for the medical marijuana program as well, based on anticipated demands of the and inspecting all the medical marijuana facilities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additional staffing is necessary to maintain a reasonable turnaround time for the inspection process. The firefighter slash investigator will be the lead staff member during annual inspections for sanctioned businesses and will also take the lead from the fire department on enforcement activities related to illegal or unsanctioned businesses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are also proposing the upgrade of two positions that will improve management and administrative oversight, upgrading a battalion chief position to Assistant Fire Chief and our Community Services Division and upgrading Marine Safety Sergeant position to Marine Safety Captain and our Marine Safety Division.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Finally, the proposed budget includes the increase and increase in ambulance transport fees. The Long Beach Fire Department has not adjusted these fees since fiscal year 14. And since that time, the rates authorized by the County of Los Angeles EMS Agency have increased and now significantly and see exceed Long Beach fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For this reason, we are proposing an increase of $217 for advanced life support transport and $105 for basic life support transport. These proposed increases will improve our cost recovery and bring us closer to the ambulance transport fees charged by the majority of providers in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Looking forward to fiscal 18, the department has several significant challenges and opportunities. The first is to improve our response times and response capabilities and to continue to meet the expectations of our community by maintaining fire suppression and emergency services staffing levels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As I mentioned earlier in my presentation, the restoration of Engine eight and Rescue 12 has improved emergency response capabilities, not just in their immediate response areas, but also citywide. Another significant challenge is to continue to train new firefighters and new fire recruits into firefighters and existing staff.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With regard to fire suppression, emergency medical services, wildland firefighting and specialized services such as air aircraft, rescue and firefighting, urban search and rescue and hazardous materials. We are an all risk department, meaning that we respond to all the needs of our community, regardless of the nature of the incident.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Therefore, we must train all of our employees to be ready to effectively respond to a wide variety of emergency incidents. Another significant challenge and opportunity is to prepare the next generation of firefighters to step into positions of leadership.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To that end, the fire department continues to train up potential for future leaders in areas of supervisory skills and management development. These succession planning efforts are critical to the long term continued success of the Long Beach Fire Department in coming years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Finally, we will continue to work with the Department of Technology and Innovation to utilize new technology to help streamline operations, implement performance management tools, and overall increase our efficiency. Mr. Mayor, Council Members, thank you for the opportunity to present an overview of the Fire Department's fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that concludes my presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. Fire Chief. And think, of course, our police chief as well. A great presentation. We're going to go ahead and go into now. The city council. Is there anything else, Mr. West, that you wanted to add to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. So how do we go ahead and go into the council? We have a motion in a second to receive and file the hearing and move to the next hearing. But let me start with Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you very much for the presentation. Very well done. And there's a lot of very exciting news that both departments share. So I appreciate that. I want to start with the police department presentation and Chief Chief Luna.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First of all, I cannot support. Any more. If it were even possible your commitment to increasing RDR. So for the folks who are not familiar with the program, D.A.R.E. is an international program and the state of California has more dealers than any other state in the United States, and dreams are going to be needed and used a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'lot more in light of the passage of Prop 64. So there is no roadside test that is reliable to detect the presence of drugs in an impaired driver's system. So the drugs are going to become a very useful tool statewide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm personally very involved with this program through my work as a prosecutor and trained statewide on this. So I'm very, very encouraged that our chief is going to make a commitment to include D.A.R.E. training for our officers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you know how many certified dealers we have on our force right now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have approximately between ten and 12 and then working to get more or gain more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So one thing that I'm thinking of and I'm putting it out there to my council colleagues and of course, you know, a good case will have to be made for it. But but I do believe there are agencies that are considering providing stipends for officers who will become certified degrees and maintain their certifications.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's something I would like the city of Long Beach to think about or participate in. So I'm putting that out there because I think that's something that the association might be interested in, including in negotiations next time around.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think a a stipend for each certified degree multiplied by the number of degrees I hope we have, would be a very insignificant amount of money in the grand scheme of things, but would encourage our officers to maintain their certifications and would make the city of Long Beach one of the first cities to have a stipend for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'degrees, which is a trend that a lot of agencies are currently exploring. So I want to put that out there so that that dialog and discussion could be had. But even if we were to double the number of degrees, a 20 $500 a year stipend, for example, for each officer that maintains their degree certification really would not'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be that big of an impact on the city, but would mean a lot to the officer and provide an incentive for them to continue their certification. So I completely support that, that program and that commitment, and I think it's very timely right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when we're in a situation, when we have a drug impaired driver involved in a horrific collision, which happens all the time, but there are those collisions that get the attention of the media. And when we're asked what is the city of Long Beach been doing to combat this issue, I want us to have a story about'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our proactive response in terms of training up our officers to become certified dealers. So thank you for that. The Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative that we allocated $1,000,000 for. Could you provide a summary for the Council of what types of projects or needs were funded with that money in 17?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Councilmember Price what we've used that money for in the past and what we intend to use it in the future is it goes to the basis of our philosophy of policing. As you all are aware, because all of you work hand in hand with our division commanders.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The community comes to you. We work closely, hand in hand, with all of your staffs to listen to our community and the needs, those needs can be anything from violent crime, property crime or quality of life issues. Every division in the city is different.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So commanders will come to us when they need resources outside of their allotment to handle some of these specialized challenges that we have. It has been a very successful program for us in the police department, I think really for the whole city in the past.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think as as you see our crime rate, which right now we're very fortunate as a city to have an overall 5% reduction, a big contribution or a big contributor to that, I should say, is the fact that we're through data analysis, we're able to see some of these challenges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're listening to our community and we're using those resources to apply to specific problems. At the end of the day, a simple math equation is that it really adds more FTE, but we put them out there on the days that are needed, at the times that they're needed, and it's been very effective for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now I know when we talked about this issue, when we first allocated these funds, it was very important to to me at least, I can't I can't speak for any of my other colleagues that that this money be used to address specific needs within districts and not necessarily prioritized based on the type of crime or the particular'",
        "'speaker_8': 'district. The basically the allocation of the funds be equitable and not really prioritized within the crime category. Do you believe that that that goal has been followed in the allocation of the funds?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe it has. And that's not only listening to our patrol bureau where our division commanders are, patrol division commanders reside, but a lot of feedback from our community members and all of you. So hypothetically saying North Division, the commander up there, Rudy Camisa, can have a challenge where he asks for these funds, this funding request.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Liz Griffin, who's in the audience, she is listening to her counsel, people out east, out in east division and the challenges are facing out east are very different than maybe the ones out west or out north or down here in South Division.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I do believe that they're being utilized for that specific community's needs and they're done by patrol division.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, that's good. That's very encouraging to hear. And, you know, I want to go on and on record in making it clear that that that money should be distributed in an equitable fashion throughout the city to address the different needs in every district, and that it really shouldn't be looked at from a district wide standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that and it sounds like you're doing deferring to our commanders in determining what the needs are. I know I meet regularly with with the commander and my division and we talk about the needs. And so she has a very good handle on what it is that our residents, what is keeping our residents awake at night, which'",
        "'speaker_8': 'may be different than what's keeping residents and another division awake at night, but nevertheless it's keeping our residents awake at night. And so just making sure that those those concerns are reviewed kind of holistically would be very important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I appreciate you. From what I'm hearing, you're continuing your commitment to that, that kind of analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For quality of life officers, I realize we have resource restraints and limitations. But I have to tell you, I think that is one of the most effective programs that we have, because it combines social work with law enforcement, which is something we rarely see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so my my question is, did we give any thought to requesting more quality of life officers? And if so, what was your recommendation in terms of whether that was a feasible option for you?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The simple answer to that is yes from a perspective that our quality of life officers are very effective at what they do. Policing has changed. But at the end of the day, our core services from a calls for service perspective, homeland security obligations and investigative obligations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We we do our best to prioritize where the people should go. And something that the council needs to be aware of is that the quality of life officers that we have for the Long Beach Police Department are not budgeted as quality of life officers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are patrol officers, calls for service officers who each division commander. Going back to what we talked about on your previous question. They they're listening to their community. They're responding to the community's needs. And they determined to pull somebody out of calls for service to apply themselves to that specific task.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have had they are so successful that we have had requests to increase the size of them. I do not have the capacity to do that at this point. So any request to add additional quality of life officers would be asking for additional FTEs for the police department sworn to ease.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I'm guessing that based on the challenges before you the recommendation on the FDA is and the new FTAs that we've already discussed and where those would be assigned, you made those recommendations based on the totality, given what your resource needs are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Okay. So I want to talk about body worn cameras. I have to say, I understand the frustrations with the technology and the lessons learned. I'm experiencing that every day in my capacity, in my other job with agencies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I will say, I think that. It's something we need to figure out and implement and in full force soon. A lot of other agencies are doing it and we have a stellar police department. We set policy for a lot of the region, set standards for a lot of the region in terms of things we try and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'do. And I would like to see us get moving and operational on the body worn cameras. And I don't know what you think about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is becoming more of an industry standard out there. It is. And that's why we are currently in the middle of our pilot program. The pilot program will end in November, and we are already gathering facts and will be doing a thorough report that will we will be bringing forward at the end of the pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as I stated in in my presentation, it is a challenge because as we are studying not only what we're doing here at the Long Beach Police Department, but we're paying very close attention to what's going on in other police departments in this region and across the country.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is extremely expensive. And if this policy body wants us to move forward with that technology, we're going to have to make a significant, significant financial commitment to do that. And that is not in this year's budget.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I and I get that and I appreciate that. What I would be interested in moving forward is how many cities of our size don't have body cameras. Because I will tell you, in the numerous law enforcement roundtables that I host and attend statewide, they are becoming the standard of practice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is rare to see an agency not have body cameras, especially a large agency. And I don't want to be one of the only agencies who doesn't have one if that's where the industry is headed. I think I think it speaks to the to the the credibility of the agency in terms of responding to and adopting trends'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and standards. So I understand the fiscal challenges, but I also think that we need to do a very good job of educating the body on, you know, what the what the best standard standard of practice is in the industry right now and being able to articulate if we can't come up with the resources to invest in that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'technology, why we believe that's not going to set us back in terms of using that the latest resources and tools. So I just think it's very unusual to be in a room with multiple agencies, at least in the Southern California region, and say who's not, who's using.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it used to be you'd say who's using body cameras six months, eight months ago, and one or two agencies would raise their hands. Now, you say who's not yet using body cameras and one or two agencies will raise their hands.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's been my experience. It could be very different in L.A. County, but I think that's data that we need to know in terms of our budgeting. And, you know, how many urban cities with a population similar to ours are not going to be using them?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's an important issue. I think that's a huge investment that we're going to have to talk about. And and we can use one time dollars for it, which is which is good, is my understanding. We would have to have ongoing money for training in that and such.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think that investment needs to be something that's a priority for us. I don't know if you agree or disagree with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You ask some very good questions. Many of the questions you're asking will be part of the assessment that will be presented to this body in several months when the pilot program is completed. And then just I don't have a list right off the top of my head of what agencies do or don't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But just as an example, the Los Angeles Police Department does have most of their officers are carrying body worn cameras. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is not. So those are two examples of two agencies that are doing it just a little bit different.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, I know that Sheriff McDonnell's considering a pilot program sort of like ours. So are they going to go that direction? That's to be seen. But those are we're trying to keep our finger on the pulse of what others are doing so we can be on the front end and not the back end.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that's very good. I would be shocked if in the next 3 to 5 years there's a single agency that's not working on body worn cameras. I mean, I would just be completely shocked to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think I think that's just something that if it's not an expenditure we have scheduled for this year or 2019, we certainly should be planning for it in 2020. But that's just my $0.02. So thank you, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I appreciate that. Chief Tory, I do have a question for you on the Hart team. So I was speaking with a council counterpart, I guess, in the City of Orange, and I know that they too have a Hart team.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not sure if exactly the same composition as ours, but it sounds like this is something that a lot of cities are using and that, from what I heard, the successes has not have not been as as impressive as ours.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the attention to the team in terms of what the public knows the team to be has not been as successful as ours. So I want to commend you on the outreach that you've done on that. Do we have any data on where we're deploying the Hart team citywide?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because one of the concerns that I hear and I don't know if it's if it's rumor or myth, but that that they they're really not going citywide. I know that's a lot to ask for one team, but what efforts are we making to to make sure that the allocation of that resources equitable.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember the the Hart team in working with the continuum of care partners at the Health Department and our partners at Long Beach PD with the quality of life officers and acting on basically what they know from being out on the street, they target certain areas where we know that people are experiencing homelessness, congregate or where they're directed'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to. It's not uncommon for the Hart team to be given a tip, if you will, that a constituent will call the fire department and say, hey, you know, there's a number of people that are experiencing homelessness in this area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Can you guys have somebody go out and check it out and we'll do that. The majority of their work tends to be in places where people who are experiencing homelessness congregate. So they're not specifically directed to be in one specific geographic location or another.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as you well know, people who are experiencing homelessness in the city of Long Beach are all over the city and in places sometimes that you can see and sometimes that you cannot. So we've done our best through Deputy Chief Rex Winkle in operations, has done our very best to get them to go out to the various'",
        "'speaker_11': 'segments of our community that have people who are experiencing homelessness and do the best we can with the two people we've got. So the short answer to your question is, no, they're not. I can't I can't tell you they're specifically assigned to one place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're doing our very best to be in as many places at once as we can. But really, the information that we get from that community and the information we get from our otherwise bigger community dictates how we deploy that resource.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Would it be feasible at all? And this is not something that you have to answer right now. I'm just I'm really just thinking out loud. But would it be feasible at all to take that resource, the number of hours they work during the week and have half of their shift each you know, half of their shift be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'designated to a particular either either a police dove initiative. We want to do it that way or a district and then have the other half be responding to constituent calls or tips or things like that. But that that they that they touch every part of the city in a week on a weekly basis, that they they touch'",
        "'speaker_8': 'it in the sense of they're driving around actively and proactively identifying people who might need help or assistance, and that there is some sort of a schedule whereby we know the Hart team will visit our district on this day, on this day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, we know for sure we can tell residents. Yes, the Hart team, you know, comes to the third district once a week, and this is the day they come, but they also come as needed or they also come as tips are given and that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that of is that even feasible?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'COUNCILMEMBER Yes, the answer is in the fire department we have three battalions right there. Battalion two typically is the east side of Long Beach. Battalion one is kind of downtown central Long Beach, and Battalion three is North Long Beach, the Hart Unit, like, as I mentioned, through our paramedic coordinator and under the direction of Deputy Chief Rex'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Winkel. They are directed to hit those specific battalions. Right. We might get information that there's a person or people experiencing homelessness over on the San Gabriel River Channel. And so they might get directed on any given day to go over there and work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And typically what happens, what we're finding, I think, with them is that when when they get to a specific geographic location, for instance, maybe they're down on the beach, that typically one conversation leads to another, to another, to another.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It becomes a very time consuming process for them to interact with folks. But they are making a difference, I think. I think to to put a little number on it for you, I want you to know that there were about 300 since they been started.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are about 346 calls that came to our dispatch center that the team was actually attached to 164 calls that they went on like welfare checks. They actually just went out and did welfare checks like you suggested. They physically proactively go out and address things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the number of times the heart unit was first on scene on those was 261 times. So they are proactively out in the community making contact with people. But perhaps the biggest number that that I'm happy about is just under 100 times they were able to cancel incoming resources, fire engines and rescues that otherwise would have been'",
        "'speaker_11': 'tied up dealing with that issue. So it's proving its worth. And I would love to have, you know, 150 more people doing that on a daily basis. And I think that's something we're actually getting to the education that we're getting with this heart unit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The heart unit then comes back and is educating the rest of our floor personnel. So ultimately down the road, we will have a better a more well-educated workforce as it relates to this specific issue. And every man and woman that's deployed in Long Beach fire should be able to interact in the same way that the heart unit'",
        "'speaker_11': 'is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that's fantastic. And it's a it's a very it's a great goal because it's really using our existing resources and teaching them a new skill, which is good for them, but it's also good for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But but I will say that, you know, I think regardless of where you are in the city, the residents in that district believe that the homeless or the transient problem is the absolute worst in their district. It doesn't matter where you're at.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so if we say to them, the heart team is going where the need is, but that need may not be always in third or, you know, oftentimes it's another area that's something that that's data that they can't relate to because to them, the problem is the absolute worst than it can't possibly be worse anywhere else in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the city. Right. And so we hear that a lot. So I think if we were able to represent to our residents that, yes, we know there's this resource that's designed to make it. We know this resource makes a difference.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know it works. And we can guarantee that this resource will spend an equal amount of time right here helping you with your need, as they will in other parts of the city. Because I think that that's important is that they may have a different perspective on where the need is, but the residents of a particular area'",
        "'speaker_8': 'may or may disagree with that. So how can we, you know, take what you and I and everyone in this room probably knows is the data and marry that with perception and allow people to see their city working for them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's kind of where and this is something Commander Griffen and I talk about all the time, because you can tell people about data all the time, but if the perception is different, you need to actually back it up with presence in order to get over that perception.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's kind of where the the nature of these comments comes from. And I'm again, I'm not looking for any particular answer right now, but I realize that that's a resource that we can't replicate right now because of our budget limitations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But to the extent that we can allocate it in a manner that is quantifiable and explainable, I think that would be very helpful for those of us sitting behind the dais. So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I have nothing further.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council in Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you and thank you to our chairperson of the Public Safety Committee for her great questions and comments. We have been working on these issues for for some time. I want to thank our chiefs, both Chief Luna and Dori, for their great presentations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The work that you, the men and women in your department do to provide public safety goes without mentioning. It's extremely important. I think it's one of the obviously a core service of the city and some of the most important work that we do and commitments that we make as a city council member when it comes to budgeting'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I had a couple of areas that I wanted to just get a little bit more information on. And so I'll start with the Chief Luna regarding some of the challenges that you raised. You raised the challenge. One of the challenges being unfunded mandate mandates for technology, mental health training and procedural justice upon the department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you elaborate on what those challenges actually are? And specifically what changes have been placed upon the department that are unfunded that we as a council can need to know about and can help possibly fund.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So some specific questions is especially like, for example, the last three years in law enforcement, when we see high profile incidents that happen across the country, there's definitely a reaction, sometimes a response to it. And a lot of the reaction usually is that very well-intended legislation comes across where, for example, there there's a request that police departments'",
        "'speaker_7': 'do more procedural justice training, implicit bias training, cultural sensitivity training, or there are databases, for example, to track racial profiling and things of that nature. The majority of the time, when somebody comes up with the legislation, people jump on board.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But they don't recognize that in order to conduct the training or just in the technology realm, that that costs money and sometimes it costs people. So, for example, for us, we I talked in my presentation about the technology strategic plan that we're working on with with our technology department in another year or so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The FBI has changed the way they're going to collect crime statistics. So they are changing their system. And our technology doesn't match those systems currently. And as we adjust and by the way, the technology or the request to change the statistics and the information being imported into the statistics, I think will make us all better will have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'better information. But we're playing catch up with that level of technology that costs millions of dollars to get there. And those are the things I talked about and working in partnership with our other city partners to make sure that we get there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From a training perspective, it always sounds good and it sounds sexy to say, Hey, we need more procedural justice training and all the ones I just listed and this department is doing that. But at the end of the day, each full time equivalent is allotted 28 hours.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then when you start subtracting training time and other time out of the field, we start doing the math of what we are able to deploy. And when you get into too much training, you pull too many people out of the field, and that's not serving our community the way it should.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we've got to find balance. And the the overtime we're talking about is to backfill a lot of patrol functions or other investigative functions when we have people away at training. So that's just something that has to be managed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when we hear about these great ideas or great legislation, I think a a question that our community needs to ask our policymakers need to ask is, where's the money coming from? Because we're pretty strapped as a as a as a city, just like any other city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understand. And that's, I think, a great explanation. I don't think I agree with everything, obviously, because as a policymaker, we have a responsibility to a constituency that is responding to these actions at the same time. My question to you is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, of the 2088 hours currently, you say per per officer. How much of that or what percentage of that is dedicated to training with, I guess, period?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is mandatory post training and that is at least 40 hours per year. And then on top of that, every day before an officer goes out in the field, they're in a roll call where they are getting usually between 20 or 30 minutes a day, minimum of some current event or something that's changing across the board.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there is constant training that's going on from that perspective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And then the training in regards to and we you listed them implicit bias, cultural sensitivity, racial profiling, etc..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Implicit bias.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Right. Do you think in any way that that training may be reduce may have an impact on reducing costs later potentially or improving police and community relations? I mean, there has to be a or has there been an evaluation in terms of cost benefits of such training?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The straight answer on that is absolutely it helps. I think all training that we're involved in, there's an old saying all training is good training and some is definitely better than others. But from that perspective, every time we have people in a classroom and they're learning how to better deal with our community members, all of us are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'better for it. And I want to throw this out as we're talking about that. If I start giving you numbers or statistics of how many calls or how many people are employee's contact per day, it's in the thousands.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if I start giving you the ratio of if you think of police work and no one dials 911 when things are going well, it's when things are falling apart. And all officers time and time again are able to defuze de-escalate and handle situations even with armed suspects on a daily basis to such a professional level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when you start throwing in the amount of complaints in there that we get, that goes to your question. It is it's minimal. It is less than half a percent. If you look at the ratios of contacts per complaints or we start getting into uses of force, your officers are doing an amazing job out there every day'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in this environment that we're in. Can we always get better? Absolutely. Are do I believe that this police department is on the upper levels of the training we're getting, comparatively speaking, other police departments? Absolutely. We're getting the best training and it's all good training.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not complaining about getting the training. I'm just saying that it does have an impact on us. And as time goes on, we get more and more requests for more training and to do things differently. And those things costs money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it and most of them are great investments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think I don't disagree with anything you said. Matter of fact, I agree with everything you said. Our police officers have the toughest jobs out there. Some of the toughest jobs. And I have nothing but respect for the work that they do, the situations they encounter on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that the average citizen myself wouldn't want to deal with and so much respect to your department and the men and women who do the work. I will say that I think that policing is changing this dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The profession, the practices, the management and administration is changing. And so we have to be flexible and recognize that balance as well. I would also go go to the the the issue of body worn cameras. I will agree with my colleague, Councilmember Price, that I think this is something that we we must commit to as a as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a city moving forward. It is the future, and we need to make it work. I think these cameras inspire public confidence as well as reduce liability for our city. And again, can they may be an initial investment up front, but I think the long term benefits in terms of just public confidence and the potentially the potential to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'reduce liability is is well worth it. And so I'd love to have more conversation about that and look. Forward to getting the the results of the pilot project that we currently have. And when it comes to two to policing, Long Beach continues to lead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to commend you for for your leadership. The the the the chiefs before you for their leadership. And I know we will continue to do that. In addition to body worn cameras, I just want to throw it out there that I think we should also be looking at investing in and cameras in our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we have them in some places, but in our business districts and in key corridors that are important to economic development, I think we need to to invest in cameras in those areas as well. Again, inspiring confidence, but also sending a message loud and clear that that we're not going to tolerate crime in those areas because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they are important to the the economic vitality of our city. I also I know in the past we have you mentioned also the the RFP process for the new records management system. Is that is that that budgeted or or do we have have we budgeted that in this this f y fiscal year?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have some money for it. And we're paying a consultant to come in and assist us to make sure that we're identifying the the right equipment for for our city. But that's something that we're going to have to work together as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it may not be budgeted this fiscal year. That may move into 19. That accurate or safe? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My financial chief behind me saying yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks to you. And then I know you councils passed in not too long ago. Over the last few years we have made strong stances on issues like human trafficking, task force and task force to address issues of prohibited possessors, to get guns off the streets and crack down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How are we dealing with those issues in this budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With our existing resources, our our officers on the street specifically are directed enforcement teams that are working out in patrol, are specialized and investigative units. And our investigations bureau continue to focus. And what we're doing is through better data.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I talked about what the I-Team is doing for us, and I'm really excited about the opportunities we have in front of us. And there will be some technology needs that go along with it. But really, instead of going out and and doing sweeps like we once did is where we're so much more data driven and focused on'",
        "'speaker_7': 'individuals. We're looking at criminal histories and and really looking at patterns and then trying to figure out who we can surgically removed from communities who are causing problems and victimizing people in our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's good to know. And I'm glad to hear that we're getting smarter, I think. But perhaps those those task force have provided some sort of tools and best practices to help us help us identify problem areas. But I'd like to, too, you know, if in any way make sure that we're in place in a strong emphasis on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those areas and not walking away from them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we are and we appreciate your leadership. I know you've always talked about human trafficking. And and I'll tell you what, the city of Long Beach as a whole is a leader in that arena and not only its police department through the leadership in this room, but we have so many community members who have done so much'",
        "'speaker_7': 'out there in organizations that we're working with too many to name right now. But this is just a completely different issue. We look at it a very different way, and I think we are one of the most effective communities in dealing with not only the suspects, but more importantly, the victims.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The other side of the equation of this horrible crime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you for your your patience. And I know we'll be continuing this conversation in the weeks to come. Chief Tory, again, thank you for your presentation. I just have a couple of quick questions for you. And forgive me, I've been I wasn't able to attend the budget hearing last week, and I'm looking beyond the head'",
        "'speaker_3': 'here for good. But in I've just been able to to kind of grapple with the budget here today. But is there an Academy plan for the fire department in this fiscal year?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Yes, part of our part of our annual our fiscal year 18 budget does include the revenue, the dollars to do a fire academy. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And then I wanted to follow up on the Hart team. I think, you know, I think Councilmember Price was on to something at our last public safety committee meeting. We went out into the community and there was a detailed presentation not only on the Hart team, but also the Met team and some of our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'efforts in terms of public safety outreach to to deal with our homeless issues, but also those with the mental illness in the streets. Is it possible and I guess my question specifically is what would it take to employ a Hart team in every battalion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You said that what currently there is a Hart team in the employ or I don't know if it's one to but one battalion but or it's moved around between three different battalions. If every battalion had a hard team dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What would be the cost? And is that possible to. To achieve?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember Each each a structurally funded heart unit costs about 300, and just under $350,000 is what the cost would be. Currently, the existing heart team that we have deployed is it's a citywide resource. It goes it goes all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as I mentioned earlier, wherever the hotspots are is where it will go. So but the structural value of that is about $350,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess with existing resources, is it possible to develop that or to, say, tweak our system in a manner that would actually provide that service?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember the no, not not without additional additional funding that we don't have. You got to remember, when we first put the hard team into place, it was put in as a pilot program. We had one time dollars to put that in place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What this proposed budget does is it turns that pilot program into a structurally funded resource, so it becomes an ongoing resource that we can use whenever. So beyond the dollars that have been allocated in this proposed budget, I don't have any other discretionary dollars that I could apply toward that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You couldn't rely on your great administrative management skills to kind of make that happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman, I might be able to do it once.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But no, we don't have any additional revenue in our budget that's not already accounted for in other programs or resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Well, I'm not going to give up on that that that thought an ideal. I think we we have some there's some opportunities. And again, with and with policing, I think with our fire services, we need to be adaptable to to change to 21st century needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Specifically, we know that, you know, fire services has changed quite a bit over the last few decades. And medical responses are are pretty much what we do. But but there's a there's a certain level of proactivity that I think is necessary for us to be the city we want to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We we have. And I'll just say I get constituent calls and correspondence on a daily basis. People are concerned about homelessness. They're concerned about, you know, people on our streets that could get services. And if we were more proactive in reaching out to them, you know, our quality of life and our neighborhoods would be a lot better'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So with that, I will reserve my comments and look forward to hearing from the rest of the colleagues at the council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That's me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Richardson My goodness, that is a lot to follow. And so, yeah, I had like three or 4 minutes, so, so let's just go through what I have here. So first, there's a lot to be proud of in this budget, but I want to begin just just talking with the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we've we've worked over the last few years to identify the resources to finally put paramedic services back into District nine and at Station 12. So and I know that we've we've worked on this. We found different iterations of of wait means to do it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We finally got it done with measure. A So what has been the impact of the system since we've placed Rescue 12 into service?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Vice Mayor When we put prior to putting Rescue 12 in service, the average response time in Station 12 was first in area for a paramedic resource was about 8 minutes and 40 seconds. Since we put Rescue 12 in service, that number has dropped down to 5 minutes and 36 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's been a significant decrease in overall response time in that geographic area and citywide. The addition of Rescue 12, because it really is a citywide resource has taken it's not as significant, but it has shaved about 30 seconds off the expected response time citywide by having that resource in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm gonna pause for a minute because that that is a significant number. So we've shaved 3 minutes of paramedic response time off of the response in North Long Beach. I mean, it's just unheard of to think about the fact that we've had response times for that long eight minute response time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you imagine a cardiac arrest, a heart attack, you know, a major events, life support, emergency, the fact that folks had to wait that long and we're finally addressing that with shaving 3 minutes off. That's something the entire city council and everybody who supported Measure, that's something they should all be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So congratulations to you and thank you for that. And I do want to say citywide, 30 seconds is significant. That means our system is healthier. It is stronger because we didn't think so much just about our backyards, but thought about the entire system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this should be evidence to us that we should we should certainly think about. The human element of the choices we make, how it really impacts and makes a meaningful difference in the lives of people. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Chief, for that are my next question. Let's talk about the fire fee. So this council went through a process and we walked down a road and explored a a first responder fee. How is that common and how is that how is that developing and how we approaching that in the budget this year?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Vice mayor. The first responder fee has been in effect for the past year, roughly. I'm not prepared to give you an actual the exact number that we've pulled in. I can tell you that is it has trended a little bit over initial projections on the amount of dollars that have come into the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We projected that it will receive over to over $2 million this year from fire impact fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is that what we saw? We met our projections.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We went over our projections. We initially projected we'd reached about $1.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In how we budgeting that surplus. Are we utilizing that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, if you go back a couple of years, Vice Mayor, the fire impact fee was was used to plug a hole that was left with the elimination of the RMD program. A portion of it was used to plug that and the rest has been allocated in the proposed budget general fund resource.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so do we anticipate to that trend to grow that we can see that as an amount that we can continue to budget on and make other enhancements to the budget with Vice Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that would be a financial policy decision through financial management. We're working with them to determine that that is a stable funding source, but we don't anticipate in the fire department that we'll see a reduction in our annual calls for service in EMS.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we believe that's a pretty it's a pretty stable number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What is the fire fee? The same level it was when we initially established it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, same same.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Number. Okay. And how does that compare to the fire fee in other of the regions?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Vice Mayor That that number is literally all over the board, throughout the region and throughout the state. In some places it's as high as 5 to $800. In some places it's as low as $50. The study that we put forward to the Council prior to implementation of the first responder fee outlined a number of cities throughout our'",
        "'speaker_11': 'region, and this placed us directly kind of right in the middle and it's actually included in the budget book from last year. If I, if you want me to refer to it, I can. But in the middle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think where I'm heading here is, you know, I don't I would love to know there was a significant discussion about how this might impact low income residents. And we established a like a a program or a system to identify them and provide fee waivers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have we have we had to use that? And at what levels like how did this impact our low income community?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. Vice Mayor The when, when we do get cold calls from time to time, we'll get calls into the fire department from people who express that they are unable to, to pay the first responder fear they have. They can test the bill or whatever, but most of them will take their information.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We then pass that information on to our partners over in financial management. And the financial management folks are very good about educating them what process or what steps they need to take in order to get the fee waived or come up with a payment plan or whatever they want to do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We don't receive a great number of those calls, but there have been a few. And Director Gross's here, he thank you, can speak to that if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since we implemented the first responder fee and at the request of city council, we've we've tried to be very sensitive about those concerns. I would say that the number of fee waivers has probably tripled or quadrupled since we implemented it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think that's all been for the good. We have I think we have done a very good job of making sure that people who have those concerns get a fee waiver application. The city attorney reviews it in general.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most of those fee waivers are approved, and I think we have considerable satisfaction in that process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's fantastic. There's been a lot of conversation about, you know, you know, we've made progress, but there's still interest in expanding, say, the Hart team. I've, you know, learned a lot through Councilmember Pierce and our fire chief about the Hart team when it was an idea.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's something that it seems like folks folks like and it seems like it's making an impact. And the narratives are great and the data is great. And, you know, based on the narrative today and other conversations that I've had, there is significant interest in expanding it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we should think about maybe a plan rather than look for a short term solution in this budget. But I think we should evaluate our ability to bear to, you know, look at that fire fee and compare where we are with other cities and see without, you know, sort of without placing a burden on our our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'low income communities or the folks who might opt into this fee waiver, see how much and someone who's insured, how much we can increase to offset a, you know, additional support in terms of the Hart team. Because what we see is a value added here with this this new model with the Hart team.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's definitely interest and need to be proactive with with homelessness. So maybe we should be creative and take a look at maybe doing a study over the course of the next year on what we could bear and how that could help us to support additional Hart team apparatus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can tell you, you know, less than a year ago, less than a year ago, my my neighbor called us because, you know, there's a gentleman you know, there's a gentleman sitting on my bench on the front porch having a good old tall can of beer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they said he doesn't look like the council member. I don't think he's a he lives there. And so, you know, we we responded and Petey responded and helped us. And we, you know, we helped get this gentleman support at our local shelter and helped it out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if that happened to me that, you know, that could tell you homelessness is a is an issue all across our city. And our residents want us to do as much as our guys as we can to evaluate ways to address it systemically, but also to respond to the needs of neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that is a balance. So I do appreciate all the dialog tonight about, you know, hey, I have a real need in my district and people want to see that response in their district because if you see your house, no matter whether you feel as equitable or not, I want to see a response.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I completely understand that. So I support the dialog as far as it's gone. In terms of the Hart team, we should look at, we should look at rather than, you know, dictating police resources and saying, just show face.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In my district. I don't see a meaningful I don't see a meaningful impact. And if that means add additional resources or or look at this first responder fee that's really working, I think that I think we have two things here that could match up and say first responder fee and an Hart team match up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, and I'd have to give once again credit to Councilwoman Pearce, because this is a conversation we've been having for a while now that we you know, we'd like to see more of this Hart team, and this may be a potential solution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So hopefully we can take that up in the in the months to come. Switching over to PD. So there's there's a lot to be proud of in the in the police department budget as well. So we've got for you know, before I do that, what do you think about Mr. GROSS?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What do you think about what I just proposed? Mr. wrote Mr. GROSS and Mr. Dery, we've got to both right next to each other. We think about that putting the plan together to leverage, to reevaluate the level of first responder fee and see if it could offset structurally funding heart or expanding heart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now my my job in the gets to be a little beyond just the financial numbers but part of part of our responsibility in financial management is to collect the fees, the first responder fees and issue you pointed out, deal with the waivers and deal with the calls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is this something we can look into from the both of your opinions? Is is this a direction that we can realistically explore?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, it can be explored. I think there would be a lot of resistance to an increased fee in that area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And Mr.. Mr. Dooley, what do you think?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think I typically defer to the director of financial management on on policies related to financial management. But I. Vice Mayor, I would certainly I would certainly provide any necessary information and that would be required to have a robust discussion on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we would definitely have a seat at the table and and see if that's something that could be done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. So. So I'd like to I'd like to understand that resistance and understand if this is feasible. So so moving on the police department. So for back to back academies, that's certainly something to be proud of. When I started working here years ago for Councilman Neal, you know, just we were fighting just to have one one academy'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I see Greg Abbott shaking her head. She remembers nodding your head. She remembers one was a big feat and we've done four back to back and we are supporting them in this budget. And that's so that is something to be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative and I haven't tracked it very closely. I remember when the discussion came up and my understanding was, you know, this is a resources that as needed, we can draw down and make sure we sort of focus on certain areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr.. Mr. Chief, how does this connect to the impact team's? Are these related to the impact teams? Because I know we utilize impact teams to really when there's an incident, we want to have a heavy response. We utilize the impact, the impacting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are they related?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Vice mayor, if you're asking about the are directed enforcement? Yes, directed at, for example, our north division directed enforcement team, which is very effective in doing what they do. Those moneys that we are talking about are apart from them, although they can be utilized as the resource on overtime.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the commander data directs us that way. But usually it is a a problem that occurs on on any specific given day or time of the day. Wherever the data takes us. So, for example, if it's auto burglaries on graveyard, we're going to figure out how to get more people on overtime during the days that we see'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that that's happening to us. So it is different, but they could be kind of the same. It just depends on where the data takes us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And I'm sure we're likely to hear much more on this from my colleagues. But it seems to me, I mean, crime crime is heading in the right direction. And in our city, we've seen crime, certain categories of crime hit in the right direction in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I meet regularly with our commander. It seems like the resources from from, you know, the are the direct enforcement team as well as the neighborhood safe streets team is being deployed in a in a meaningful way that's making a difference.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'd like to continue to evaluate that and make sure that, you know, our body, you know, as elected officials, were not influencing things based on a different value model, anything other than need, anything other than, you know, need and crime and keeping our community safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd love to I'd love for, you know, to continue to hear that. And I think it would go a long way to here, you know, city manager, one of these memos on a memo to come out soon, just giving an update on that that that program, because since it first came out, I haven't really received an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'update on it. So I'd like to see that. Yeah, that Miss Malika got it. Thank you. So I'm really excited about some of the data driven justice stuff. So we had a conversation maybe a year ago, Mr. Chief, who was in your office and we, you know, we talked about a number of things from, you know, rap'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lyrics to to models that we've seen all across the country, from Oakland to New York. And since then, you know, we've been heading in that direction. Our innovation team has pivoted and establish a new a new sort of focus here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, we had a community community discussion around 21st century policing, you know, over two years ago with our ministers alliance and so so clergy and community partners about really doubling down on things like diversion and things like sort of body cameras and things like implicit bias steps have been taken to head in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Specifically, the innovation team's work, specifically the violence prevention work that brought in an expert to talk about implicit bias training and the establishment of the office equity. And the way I see it, they're all aligned. They're all really aligned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what I'd like to see really is a more comprehensive approach, since, you know, we've heard a lot of discussion at council tonight. And frankly, I think that's what our people on staff has been waiting for. You know, significant people on the council to start saying these things, hey, we want to be serious about body cameras.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want to be serious about 21st century policing because this conversation is really only taking place in the communities. It's taking place at the Federal Legislation Committee. But I think it is appropriate that we have this conversation. So I want to say thank you to Councilwoman Price, Councilman Austin, for helping to breach this subject at the council'",
        "'speaker_6': ', because it has been difficult the last few years to get this amount of focus on this. So I look forward to working together on more comprehensive. Comprehensive we looking at how we can address 21st century policing. I know that there was a study came out of the White House and that we evaluated and we placed into our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'process with the establishment of the My Brother's Keeper Local Action Plan. And we pointed to a number of a number of things, including the version to focus on. And just two weeks ago and I'm not sure if the public is aware of this, our work has been recognized because we hosted a national summit right here in Long'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Beach with the Obama Foundation and the My Brother's Keeper Alliance discussing this very subject matter. So I think it's really encouraging to go to this summit and thank you to all city staff and the mayor for helping to land this here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to take that and here we are two weeks later at the at the city council during a budget discussion, talking about making these things real. So so I want to say, this is this is fantastic work. And I want to see I think I want to see some tracking and some discussion publicly about these 21st century'",
        "'speaker_6': 'policing tactics. And in turn, specifically on body cameras. On body cameras, you know, the pilot that we set out, set out on, I do want to see where we are in terms of data, because I know it took us a little while to get up because of the issues with data and information and the legal circumstances surrounding'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that. So I don't want to put any pressure to keep up with another city. What I'd like to do is put a put a real program together that's structurally sustainable and makes make sense and that the community can have a little bit of confidence and faith in so that so that's that's good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So kudos to everyone who's discussing that and hitting that heading in that direction. The next thing I want to talk about, fireworks. So, you know, fireworks lived in North Long Beach for seven years now. And I got to tell you, it's different when you have a when you have a three, three month old.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, before I would when I was a young guy or a single guy or when me and my wife were just alone, we just we didn't the impact that as much we didn't hear the impact as much because we always spent 4th of July away with family.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I can tell you, it is a disaster. I saw our response, the fireworks to the public. And I know our fire, our police officers and our firefighters work hard. They are slammed. I completely get it. I completely get it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they work hard and I've had conversations. We speak with our commanders and our fire folks all the time, but in reality, we've got to figure something out. And what and what I think is I think the in the hearts and minds of our residents, we need to do a better job at communicating the circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The conundrum wherein in terms of this region I live, you know, my district is adjacent to Compton, Bellflower, Lakewood, Paramount and Rancho Dominguez. And all of them have different rules on fireworks. So living as close to different borders, I hear the impact across the border.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what I'd like to really see and where we can work together on, because there's no easy solution to this. I'd like to see us to engage in a real conversation around sort with these adjacent cities to see if we can talk about a regional a regional solution to this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I, I think the city councils in those areas, we've had off the cuff conversations. I think there's something there we can talk about constraints or maybe engage the county about a response regionally. But I think we need to have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those are those are my remarks on on fireworks. And I would also say that I think physically people want to see a certain level of response like I don't think we bad to grab certain parks and heavily impacted areas and literally set up set up tents with some of our have set up a firework fireworks information'",
        "'speaker_6': 'station on the 4th of July at a park in the middle of the neighborhood where you can talk about where you you know, where to go to report something and you can get information in. And people will feel like feel like we're not just running around putting putting out fires, literally, but rather we have a central location'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to where the community might feel safe. And we can rotate these things around because I know resources are different, but I want to see like a visible response beyond what we did this year on lawn signs. So I definitely have had to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The last thing I'll say is I think I think it was really smart in this presentation to outline your challenges. So I do want to acknowledge that the fact that you outline these challenges, it helps us as a city council to to maybe, maybe can put ourselves in your shoes a bit and understand what your what your'",
        "'speaker_6': 'what your problems are so that we can think be solution driven. Right. And so I would I would like to. And Mr. City managers, that's something that we're encouraging all the departments to do. Yes. Is that is that new?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't remember. That is a new thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've done it before. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I think it should be standard moving forward. Just standard, because, you know, it really helps put things in perspective. So so thanks again to everyone on this. And this has been a good dialog. And again, you know, the my take away from here is that our police department is doing great work and they need and, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, everything has a cost. And we should really think about how we can be intentional to identify new resources, support them. And secondly, three minute response time, three minute cut on our response time in North Palm Beach is something that that I'm going to be proud to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now next up is Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Crime is headed in the right direction. Must be like. I don't understand it. I mean, in the right direction. Up, down, sideways. You know, whatever. I mean, either way, I know it's a positive statement, not a positive statement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the bottom line is, is that, you know, there are some challenges in this budget that the both chiefs have mentioned. We're not exactly where we want to be. Of course, you know, I don't know if we ever will be where we want to be in regards to budgets for our public safety personnel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I and my focus mostly is that we're talking about people and we're talking about those service providers as first responders that we need to have on duty to ensure that those response times are done, to ensure that crime is headed in the right direction, to ensure that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Residents feel safe, and that when they call 911 or the non-emergency number, that there's going to be somebody there quickly and efficiently and provide the the needed response that they need to have. So my comment on this is going to be very brief, very short.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's dealing with if we're going to want people coming out of our academies who are ready and have all the equipment and all the tools that they need to do their jobs, we need to do it at the front end as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So my emphasis is mostly and I've spoken with the city manager about this before, is that we need to dedicate more money, more resources to our recruitment efforts to ensure that we get the most qualified people out there to apply for our jobs in police and fire.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that includes dispatching security, all that. And it's a full service that we want to provide our residents. So I want to ensure that we have enough money in our budget here and identify. To provide some recruitment teams and advertising dollars to make sure that we get the word out that Long Beach is hiring.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a great place to work. It's a great place to live in this great, great, great, great place to raise family. So I hope that from here on out, we are able to get that message out there that low is hiring coming to work for us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a great career. And and we don't do that unless we get the word out with a good recruitment budget and advertising budgets around. That's my message on that. And that's about police and fire. What we need in both areas in regards to the budget, of course, it always is challenging and I think that one of the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'things we haven't really paid any attention to on the city council and I think it's with us at this point, is the the declining condition of our police academy. I mean, I remember back in the day when it was a nice Rancho style Academy lockers, showers, you name it, it was a very nice place to be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our recruits loved to be there. And now we have where bungalows, trailers. And I think that they're getting old. They they have to be old and they have to be falling apart. So I think that we have to look at dedicating some of our budget into replacing those trailers and getting an academy that's top notch state of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the art that provides all the full abilities of our police department to train our police officers the best that they can and that there's a department that they really want to come to because we've got a great topnotch academy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know what the stats are right now in regards to our academy being used by other agencies. I know we used to have recruits coming from other agencies to train with us. I don't know if we're doing that anymore or do we have the capacity to do that anymore?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Put both police and fire.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We for the police department, we currently in this class, this recruit class, we have four members from outside agencies and we did in the previous one as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that speaks well for us, but I'll be probably turning over here because they don't have academies themselves. So but regardless of the growth of that, I think we can expand that opportunity for other departments as well. If we get an academy that that's top notch.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I would like the city council to look at ways that we can create a better Academy experience, if you will, for our recruits once they join a department. And that goes for both both departments. So I hope we can get something if if it takes a bond or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's something that we can discuss in terms of what we need to do to ensure that we have a police academy that that and fire academy. That's a top notch. I know a lot of the emphasis has been on homelessness and the the increased services that we need to provide to those individuals, as well as to respond'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to requests for service when there is a homeless individual out in the in the street and what the response is going to be, we have we have the response teams for that. But from from speaking to some residents, you know, their feel they're feeling isn't without perceptions and some of it is factual.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Some of mine that might not be is that they're getting bolder and more aggressive as time seems to go on. So we need to look at how we can best deal with that with our homeless issues and problems.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're going to be getting some additional funds for an account from a county measure h. H. H. H. Therefore, H or three. H.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'H or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, we're getting 1hi here. I was hoping for a4h program, but that's another story. So we are going to get some help and some relief. But, you know, we need to a few more. So I'm sure that our our departments are going to be looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And given that, has there been a a decrease or a re a new focus on gangs? And back in a few years ago, we're talking about the elimination of the gang unit and its possibility of reinstating it. And I haven't heard any talk about that lately, and I haven't heard the police department really address that the last'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at least the last two budgets. Are we beyond that? Have we have we restructure, reorganized our departments in such a way that we're addressing it, but not really calling it that anymore?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman, your anger regarding gangs. We have not stopped working. Gang enforcement. We never did stop, I should say. Once upon a time during the recession, when we lost over 20% of our staffing, our field gang unit was eliminated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we still had a gang investigations section, a very effective one, a very good one. And to this day, they're very effective at what they do. We have to use other resources within the department. For example, directed enforcement teams in each patrol division are very effective at dealing with violent crime, specifically gang members.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But again, as I've said earlier, very good questions asked. We just have a very different way of approaching it. I think it's a much smarter way of approaching it, a very data driven, focused way of approaching it. And I think and I knock on wood, that's why our murder rate year to date is down over 30%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our gang shootings are down about a third over 30% as well. So the men and women of our department and I got to say, our community, our partners, it's a it's a whole team effort, are doing a very effective job at managing that challenge.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it is always a challenge, but we continue to take it on and. And. Yeah, I mean, they're.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's great. You know, that that's a statement that that carries very, very well with me in terms of the police department is doing an excellent job in, in addressing ah gang issues and problems and if it being able to get done without having a specific dedicated gang unit to it, all the better.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean that means that we're, we're are using our resources effectively and efficiently. That's all I have to have. That's all I have to say to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, first, I want to echo a lot of what my colleagues have said. It's great to hear people talking about equity, even though we might not be using the word equity. When we talk about police cameras and we talk about data driven results.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are things that we need to be able to do to govern for everybody in ways that might help those that have the least tools at their disposal to those that have the most. And so I'm going to try to be quick and not go through all of my questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll start with fire. We've had a lot of chat about the Hart team, which I, of course, love. As far as the first responder fee, is there anything keeping the city from saying that we would have a policy to stay at the rate of the county first responder fee?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, Councilmember, I think I want to let me clarify that. So the county of Los Angeles does not establish a first responder fee. The county of Los Angeles, the local EMS agency, does established establish a guideline for ambulance transport fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the first responder fee is something different. Let's make sure I clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It might be a long night.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To your to your question, though, I think I understand your question. That would be a a decision that the council would make to determine how you how the council wanted to direct financial management or the department to establish, ah, ambulance transport fee as it relates to what it currently is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. And my understanding is we have three battalions in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one proposal that we're kind of playing around with through conversations with you and financial management is if we it's fantastic that we have one that's going to be structurally funded. I think that's great that the pilot program demonstrated numbers that that say this is taking time, that we're not having to use elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if we were able to increase our first responder fees to a level that we could do another pilot program for one of the battalions, I've also been in conversations with our county supervisor around funding and possibly another one so that we could hopefully get to three so that we're at the city capacity, because we do know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that there's great need on, you know, underneath our freeways by the airport. You know, my colleagues just talk. So I want us to try to explore some options outside of the box to try to figure out where we can get funds to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd also like to ask you, how soon could we possibly get just a really quick memo on the Hart team and the impact that you guys have seen, because I know after three months of being employed that are being utilized, that we already had some good numbers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I didn't see those numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Directly in your report.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And Councilmember, we can put together we can put together a memo to the council that outlines all the data points, some of the many of the data points I brought up earlier. But we can go through a kind of a chronological history for you, and I could probably provide that within 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, fantastic. The other conversation that's been coming up is the need for another academy for fire. I know in my district alone, we've got several hundred new residential units coming on and obviously we want to make sure that we have enough fire to to handle that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I might not be restoring an engine, but just doing the basics of the academy. Where are some funding sources that financial management or fire might be looking at if we wanted to give some direction?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, Councilmember, as I mentioned earlier, that the fire department is funded for one fire academy. Typically that's going to depends on the lengthy academy, but that's typically around 20 for new recruits that would start the academy. And we do have some attrition typically.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the key question here for us, we're finding now that, you know, the council has with Measure A and a lot of the council allocations over the past couple of years, we've actually begun to hire people again. We're still kind of playing catch up, though, from a number of years with no academy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you're correct, even though we we brought on two academy classes this year, we're still showing numbers. It looks like we're going to be down a number of firefighters over the next two years. So we're exploring creative ways inside our existing budget that we can potentially add more recruits to our existing fire academy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But certainly any dollars, any kind of one time dollars, I suppose, that were available to help us bring in new firefighters to the system would be would be beneficial for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you for that. I know that you guys also have a long list of any other one time fund opportunities. So obviously we want to support fire as much as possible. I think what you guys have here has been great being able to see us upgrade different staff and I just want to make sure that as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our city grows in population that we have enough firefighters and the resources necessary for that. So obviously fully support. Trying to think creatively about a Hart team option for police are awesome PD department I want to say. How great it is to see in this report back that we're looking at data analysts, that we're shifting over some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'resources to make sure that we're doing that. How closely is the department working with the Office of Equity currently? If at all. I know we're working with the team.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are absolutely working with the team. We've been in meetings regarding the Office of Equity. It's a new office. It's just coming online. So we have had conversations and we're looking forward to working with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fantastic. And I know that you guys are working with the with the team on some of the data. I think what would be really exciting is to see the Office of Equity with the team working with you guys to share with us what data points you guys are hitting on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that they're you know, we could pull data on small areas or on a very long list and looking at what other cities have done, like St Louis, like Seattle, what are the data points that have helped them kind of see a shift would be really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I really want to just celebrate the work that you guys have done that you've put into this. I fully support our additional academies. I wanted to ask on the national incident based reporting system that we're going to be shifting over to in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How is that different from what we're currently doing?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Give me a second and I'll get a document I have that actually explains it in a just a quick paragraph. It's actually pretty exciting stuff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. It's where I'm trying to talk fast.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in the past, the FBI collects well, actually, we turn in our crime statistics on a monthly basis to the Department of Justice, State, DOJ, and then they in turn turn it over to the FBI. And that's the what we call the 3010 or refer to the 3010 report in here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And usually that was just crime stats that they're asking us for. Like, for example, part one divided into violent crime and property crime. What this new system is going to do it. It collects it collects each offense within each incident.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what I what I find exciting about this, it actually asks for characteristics about victims offenders and arrestees property data. So it gets more specific into the incidences. So we'll have potentially the ability to better identify patterns and trends and things of that nature and have more information that people typically ask us about offenders and victims that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'were not always readily able to answer without doing an extensive hand search.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's great and it's great to hear for the camera conversation. Obviously, you guys know my opinion. I completely echo that and think that it's, you know, as you mentioned, that it's cost savings if we're investing in this in the long run.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we look at any. Times that we've been we've had to pay out because of legal challenges. And, you know, I'd be interested to see what other cities have seen reduce as a result.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of having those cameras.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I like to say that my colleague, Councilmember Price and I definitely almost everything she said I agree with today. So that's fantastic, which is great. The last question I have is on property crime. While our crimes overall are going down, property crime obviously is still a challenge and we know that crime rates are directly correlated to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'poverty after school programs, making sure that we have some of that in place. But what is the your department's angle at trying to reduce those property crimes?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry about that, Councilman or Councilwoman Pierce, regarding the crime stats, our property crime is actually in the negatives. It's for the 3010. In June, it was -8.6%. Where besides homicide and rape and violent crime, that's unfortunately the crime that's going the direction we don't want it to, but we're working hard to do that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But overall, the city crime is down 5.4%. From a property perspective, property crime perspective. Our officers are responding to it because our community is more active, I believe, than it ever has been. From a community watch perspective. They're seeing something, they're saying something, they're calling us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're getting to the calls. Usually priority one calls. We're getting there below 5 minutes. That teamwork is really helping. Our investigators are working as hard as they ever have to get the cases filed with the district attorney's office or the city prosecutor's office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're effective in that sense. And I think it's it's important to recognize that we as the city of Long Beach are doing good, comparatively speaking, to the cities around us who are not doing good for a lot of the challenges that we've talked about before in here with Proposition 47, for example, and the challenges with the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'criminal justice system, we have more people on the street who are not incarcerated and a lot of them for good reasons. But we have repeat offenders who are committing a dozen burglaries, 18 burglaries that we're catching are putting away, and then they're coming right back out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those are the constant challenges we have and we're trying to do a better job. Again, going back to this I-Team concept of being more data driven. So we focus on those not that we're going to ignore any crime, but we want to be more focused on these individuals and their histories of why they're there in the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'first place. Is there some education issues, some health issues, substance abuse issues, mental health issues? So I'm really excited about the I-Team and the way we'll be able to use the data to drill down and really focus on these individuals, not only from a police enforcement perspective, but a trying to get them help in a more holistic'",
        "'speaker_7': 'way for me. And I'm going to just focus on the substance abuse part of this, where if we can go to our partners out there and specifically say, hey, we have a grouping of people, how can we help with these individuals?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they use them as examples, positive examples. Maybe we can turn the tide and keep them away from committing some of these property crimes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you for that. And I know you guys are working closely with our city prosecutor's office and that's been huge. So thank you for that clarification. My very last question is the percentage. I'm curious for financial management.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We use Tidelands funds right now to cover some overtime for public safety. How does that percentage right now compare to other years?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The same or have we dipped into.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That more than we have in the past?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We can take a look at the report and come back. I believe it's the same as we have in other years that we're not decreasing, but we're not increasing. But we can look into that and get your response.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, definitely. I know that fire brought up, you know, special events. Obviously, we are seeing an increase in special events. A big chunk of those special events happen to be in our Highlands area. So just want to make sure that we're exploring ways that we can have a conversation around making sure we have resources there so that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can use other resources throughout the city to to cover in those areas as well. So those are my questions. Thank you, guys, very, very much. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Lucky for me, most of my questions have been answered. So. And for us. For all of us. Yes. Okay. Well, I appreciate each of your departments and all of our employees and each of you. I have had just such great back and forth with each of you on on many of the initiatives that we've put in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'place. And I think we are in a really great position currently as a city. So I'll start actually with a question for both of you. How about that? This is a question about, you know, we've been often hearing about and we see it in downtown, unfortunately, the opioid epidemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't see anything in the in the budget specifically tackling that. But I know we're working on that. Of course, some cities have put together like a city county task force. Have we are we doing that or is there intention to do that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember. Yeah. Thank you for bringing up that topic. This is a it's not just a Long Beach issue. This is a national issue that the fire service and our police partners are dealing with on a national scale. There's been a great emphasis and effort lately from the state of California through our federal partners down to the state'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and now coming down to the local level, level, greater levels of education for our employees as they deal with some of these drugs that are out there in the community today in at levels that we've never seen before.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I will tell you that we in fact, just today at fire headquarters, we're having a conversation about this very subject and and the information that we wanted to give to our nurse. Educators are our team, our education team to then get out to our paramedics, get out to our crews in the field, things to be aware of'",
        "'speaker_11': '. And that that also stands true with the police department as well. I mean, there's been a number of cases recently in the local region where police officers will arrive on the scene first and they will be exposed to drugs and opioid, you know, fentanyl and some of these other drugs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They get exposed to that and creates a hazardous materials environment. Fire department ends up coming in and cleaning it up. So it is a very, very serious, very pressing issue. We're taking it seriously. We're beginning to address it through proactive training of our folks with our existing resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And I think we all just kind of needed to hear that, because I know it is a national we hear it. We're hearing it everywhere. And it's just it's scary. I mean, you see people on the street and they just look, you know, they're just completely lost and it's unfortunate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just. Councilman Gonzalez, just real quick, just to add, from the police department's perspective, actually, Councilwoman Pryce asked me this question probably I'm going to say about a month ago or so. And we have a current project that we're working on within the police department, number one, and we're working with our partners in fire in trying to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'figure out it is we're definitely hearing about it. There's a significant challenge on the on our East Coast, some of our East Coast departments. You hear about it every day in the news. My major city chief meetings, it's been brought up, but it's we're doing a stat review to see if it's really a challenge here in our'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city, both on the police and fire side of things. Because when we talk to our employees, they're not identifying it as something they're seen as we're hearing about it in other places. But as always, we've got to be ready for these things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So some of the questions that Councilwoman Pryce had asked about was the use of Narcan that's been used more and more by police departments. So we're currently looking at that and looking at potentially buying it for some officers, trying it out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And again, I really appreciate Chief Gehry's help in it, because at the end of the day, it's it's almost like applying a medication, and that's kind of a new area for our officers. So we're looking at it, we're studying it, and we hope to have more information for all of you here in the very near future regarding'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. And I'm glad you brought up the stats because I think if there's, you know, not a clear enough issue with that, then obviously we have to direct our resources elsewhere. But we know it's somewhat of an issue here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate both of your responses on that. I will start with fire. So great that we have a new academy, 24 new recruits. Sounds wonderful. I also wanted to ask about the increase in the ambulance transportation fees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we have financial projections as to what that will look like in the coming years for us?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember? No. All we can use all we can do is base current kind of current projections on historical data. What we know we've collected in the past. We do know that if we raise raise the ambulance transport fee, the two on the Ehla side and the blue side, we expect to generate an additional $722,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'OC. Okay. Great. And then on the last question for you, Chief Derry, the fireworks I know has been, of course, an issue for everyone city wide. And there was a thought out there about and perhaps it's just a collaboration, but a thought of having more free firework shows, perhaps funded through the foundation of sorts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't know if that would even be a deterrence for individuals to not pop off that are, you know, not on 4th of July, but just a thought out there. You know, I don't know. Maybe we'll see what happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I also want to commend your your Marine Safety Department as well. I think they do an incredible job out there. So overall, great job. And thank you so much for everything you do. So, Chief Luna, also incredible work as well, the innovative recruiting that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to make sure that as do the civil service. I saw that in the proposed budget and it will be done through civil service. This is not an extra position. Correct. That will be designated for recruiting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're doing it through our existing resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And civil service is a great partner. They've been doing an amazing job with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, wonderful. And then the Neighborhood Safe Streets Initiative. I love to see that. It's great that we're creating a robust bus program around that. I know that. I hear you on the bus transit all the time. See something, say something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's in English. It's in different languages. I would say if we can continue that. That would be great, especially in the communities that you know are non English because we know a lot of our we have a homicide that happens and no one calls.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so any more outreach that we can do to just continue that discussion that we need, you know, people out there calling and being proactive is important. And then lastly is do we have a separate dataset for gangs statistics?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we I don't know. I'm sure it's embedded perhaps in violent crime, you know, violence and other stuff. But do we have a separate data set for that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're getting better and better at tracking specific gang information. But we do have a stat we keep away from the 3010 regarding gang shootings. And that's why I indicated earlier that our gang shootings are down year to date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. And then last that I'll leave is with, of course, security cameras. I know with our tech services as much as we can get those up and running as fast as possible, the better. I know we're adding some on our Washington middle school and I have to commend Commander Burke and Camp and Commander Lewis, who've'",
        "'speaker_1': 'been working with us. They have been incredible. I will tell you, you know, when people say that you guys need more training, we need this, absolutely everyone needs more training. But at the same time, to be able to put these groups together and just have a panel, we had Doug Halbert with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had our of course, our Commanders and Ministers Alliance Central, and we built a really good collaboration with great feedback. So I just want to commend your commanders for that as well. And I think those are all of my questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And actually, I'm sorry, I have one question, and this is actually since we're in the PD field, this is actually directed towards our city manager. And I don't know if you have a question for me or I'm sorry, an answer for me relative to our safe passages at Washington Middle School.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what is the question?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our Safe Passages program at Washington Middle School.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to defer to the chief on that. Yeah, if you can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman Gonzales, if you could ask me, between myself and Mara, we should be able to answer it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. D r update council woman Gonzales that we're waiting for the contract to be received from the county. So it is in process and we're working towards executing that agreement. Okay, great. Any help that I can provide in speeding that up, you'll let me know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I thank you for all your work in that. I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. First of all, I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Want to thank all the individuals for sticking around tonight because we only have 32 more items to go. And I know some of you are going to have to stay in the others. You guys are warriors. I find that being close to L.A., you can just sit around and listen to Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Price and Vice Mayor Richardson. You'll get all the overlays if you just stick.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Around, listen to them because they're going to tell you what's going on. I went to sleep, woke up, and they were still talking. But it's okay. It's all right. And I'm going to rush right through this. I don't have two questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is the two things that I heard from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both our chiefs was that it said that crime in the city was down 5%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is wonderful. The other 3% that, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Response time, that was wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You guys just keep up the good work. I have nothing else to say. Everyone else has said everything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mongo hearing the applause and knowing that everyone else has said everything. Perhaps we should start with the rule that the maker of the motion gets 2 minutes. Then every council member after that gets one minute with unlimited recues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As long as you go to the end of the line so that we each get the opportunity to ask the questions that may have been important to our district, but perhaps people at home weren't. They might have been awake at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's after 10:00 now, so who knows? I have a couple of quick questions. Hopefully not too many. I love the Hart team. Think they do meaningful work. Meaningful impact on the homeless study did show that homeless is down in the city as a whole, but that homelessness is up in the East Division.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that when we talk about deployment of resources, while there's still a majority of homelessness in the downtown area, we do have to be mindful of where it is migrating to and do our best to sometimes get ahead of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I kind of think of the potential deployment of the Hart team to be kind of like what we're doing within public works in terms of slurry, sealing some of the streets that we can save and addressing the people who are about to become homeless and or are just becoming homeless and or are moving because of new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mitigating factors and what opportunities there are within that. So there was an infographic online. I've actually been asked to find it and I actually don't remember where I thought if it was Twitter or Facebook or if one of my colleagues had posted it, but it showed a map of the city and it was blue dots of everywhere'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The Hart team had responded and they were all in one council district. And I think that that was alarming to the community. I don't know if it was meant to be. Look at all the great work we've done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're out in the community. There's a lot of dots. I don't know if it was data or if it was just made up. And I think that part of that will be rectified by how we are implementing some communication strategies and public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we need to be do a better job communicating because I think you guys are doing a great job and I have seen the Hart team on the East Side, but when I looked at the end of the graph, the moment it was when I thought there was not a single blue dot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where's where's Commander Griffin? From the cherry line over of the East Division of Police Department. There wasn't one blue dot. And so I think that that's a messaging more than a real resource allocation, anything to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So Councilmember the the infographic you're referring to was posted on Facebook and the fire department every month puts out a series of maps basically based on council district that shows in that council district how many calls for emergency medical services we had, how many fire calls, non fire calls and Hakeem calls.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I suspect what might have happened is you might have been looking at a specific council district and the Hart team calls in that council district were specifically posted there just for that council district. If you looked at a different council district, you'd see the Hart team calls their I will tell you that we deploy the Hart'",
        "'speaker_11': 'team to respond anywhere in the city where the work dictates we go. They they go where we find people who are experiencing homelessness. And that work will take them all over the city. Yes, it's true that we seem to experience a larger number of people experiencing homelessness concentrated in our beach and downtown core.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But they are very active in North Long Beach to the best of our ability and very active outreach to the best of our ability. It is important to put it in perspective that we have one Hart team and and it's the success of the program, the success of the pilot program and all the outcomes, the beneficial outcomes'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we've seen have driven demand to a level that is difficult to keep up with, but we're doing our very best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would hope that we don't communicate information in districts anymore because I think that when those get out, it leads to misinterpret misinformation in the community. And I think that while we are elected by districts and we do a lot of work ensuring that our districts are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are getting their fair share of resources. We also and that it's equitable. I appreciate that too. We also have to think citywide and this is a $3 billion one city budget. And so I think it's important that we keep that in mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were talking about the ambulance transportation fees. I know there's a number of fees within the fire department. Do you want to name a few that are the more recent acquisitions to the department, including the ambulance transportation fee and what that amount is and what the increase is looking like because in the budget book I see $700,000'",
        "'speaker_2': 'variance, but it doesn't say like it's going to go up $32 or it doesn't say the specifics.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember The budget does. When you talk about ambulance transport fees, we're proposing it's a 270, $217 increase in Allison, $105 in bills. That's in the budget pages as proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I must have missed that. So I was looking through when I saw the total net. So what is the current rate and what is the new rate proposed?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Go ahead, David. David Honey City.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or you can tell me what page to go to. I have all 500 pages here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not sure what page it's on, but the the current rate for advanced life support transport is $1,675, and under the proposed budget, that would go $217 to $1892 for transport.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what percentage of that is currently reimbursable by a majority of the insurance providers in the region that are 100% reimbursable for the first call a year? Or I mean, how much how much are we really burdening our taxpayers?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember. That's a question for financial management. You're asking about revenue billing returns. Am I correct in that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I guess if we want to have a robust discussion, I think that's a quote from earlier. You have a robust discussion about fees. What we really need to talk about is how many addresses are being billed this fee annually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How many of these addresses are getting multiple billions annually? I know that we have a couple of addresses within the community that are over users of the system, but then there are others that are moderate users. And then to know and understand, are these the fees that are being burdened by the resident or are they being burdened'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by insurance? And if they are available for cost recovery for the resident through insurance, what percentage of them are actually being paid by insurance companies? Because a $200 increase doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a lot to a person living on a fixed income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was that a question?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the question is what percentage of these fees are paid by insurance companies versus single payers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the most part, to the extent people have insurance, it will be covered by fees, by insurance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even the new rate. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what we believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And will there be a chart that will be getting it sometimes similar to when we increase fees in any of the other departments in the city that kind of show current fee total rate cost recovery. What percentage of these fees go to collections?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A breakout. Yeah. A I mean, this is a large fee to just fold into the budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember, I'd like to weigh in here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the proposed increase in ambulance transport fees would actually put us it's about 50, 50% of what would be required to actually get to what the county rate what Los Angeles County is currently charging for ambulance transport fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Long Beach if you remember in 2014 we we as a to a one city we went beyond what the county was charging for ambulance transport fees. We said we wanted to set our rates higher. We went about almost $200 higher than what the county was charging, which prior to that we had traditionally always kind of married up'",
        "'speaker_11': 'with what the county was charging. There are 31 fire departments in Los Angeles County. 28 of them used the county rates as the baseline and it's built into their budgets. The other the other, there's two of them that are above county rates and a couple that are below.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are now one of them that is below. So this proposed increase would get us about 50% of the way to getting to what the current county rates are, what's being charged in Los Angeles County. So it's it's I think I just want to make sure that we're clear on what we're talking about here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then when we're talking about raising the fees, Long Beach will still be below 28 other fire regional fire agencies for the same service.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there are some fees that we charge for that L.A. County does not yet charge for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Your speaking of the first responder fee specifically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And are we proposing an increase to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And if we do get a report back to have a discussion about the fees, I think that it would be a good dialog because I think that part of the first responder fee was to deter non appropriate utilization of the system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that there are certain addresses that are consistently utilizing our services. I think we've talked about some of these sober living homes that don't have appropriate staffing that we can't do anything about because they're mandated by the state and others such like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that some of the data that we probably need to have in that discussion that we hopefully will have is what those utilizations look like next body worn cameras. So I appreciate the dialog today. I am a personal supporter of body worn cameras.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I strongly encourage any police officer whose department or agency does not supply them to choose to wear them on their own. They are available for purchase. I think that if we're going to deploy body worn cameras as a department, I appreciate that we've gone with the pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that it's really important to discuss the true long term costs that are required. This is not a one time investment. A true body worn camera program includes retention and data and management. And storage of that data is a long term cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It includes upgrades and technical assistance that I think really need to be evaluated. And so I was wondering if part of the reason that this is still a challenge is because we've actually started modeling what those costs are for an agency of our size.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we know what those costs are? Is that still a part of the process? What's the timeline on knowing that? Is that a part of the pilot program council?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One month ago, we selected a very unique technology solution that was not readily available several years back when we started this program. And part of determining the cost depends on which solution we pick. The vary depending on how data is uploaded and how it's stored.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's a cost consideration that we have not yet fully undertaken, but we will do over the next several months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate that. I think that that is a really important component of the dialog. I think that there are not only concerns about the data and its access, but the security related to it. Because when a police officer goes into the home of a community member, they are in their most vulnerable moments as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And while I appreciate that the cameras are there to protect everyone in the in the situation, I think that oftentimes the victims of violent crime, the victims of. Domestic violence. The victims of all of these things are often portrayed in those videos.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you have to talk about what does it look like to redact out people who don't want their identity shared and their personal situations shared? And I really think that we need to have a serious discussion about what that looks like, because these videos without proper security can be very salacious in nature.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Agreed. Councilmember Mongeau. And that is spelled out in our our pilot policy, very strict and direct about the victim privacy. So we're very concerned and and that'll be part of our assessment as we move forward. How did that work out?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And not only looking at how it worked out for the Long Beach Police Department, but still looking at best practices around us to see what we've learned. And with body worn cameras, it still is a newer technology. We're learning things every day from all of our law enforcement partners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I appreciate that. I think that I know that not many people take the time to delve into all 510 pages. But I appreciate all the staff that have put in the work. I appreciate even throughout this dialog, the many questions that staff have been available to answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the two dividers worth of data we've been provided so far. And people do read the book. I know that a lot of staff take a lot of time to put it together. So thank you. Thank you to everyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope my proposal on the two and one minute is seriously considered by this body for speaking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Soprano.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. I think I'm the last speaker. So if that doesn't get a round of applause, I don't know what will happen. Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One minute.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. I'm just following up on a couple of issues. I want to go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Back to the fire first.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Responder fee to Chief de re. As I recall, that was implemented two years ago, July 2015, and it was projected to generate about 1.8 million -200 K for administrative costs or whatnot. Is that about right?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And do we have data?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just know what was proposed at the time. I don't know if we have data to to see where it is now, but we're not increasing that fee is the point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct, sir. And we projected.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That we would receive about $1.6 million. We believe it's trending towards about $2 million of revenue that would come in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are not proposing an increase in the first responder fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. But we're we're trending a higher amount than we projected. Yes, sir. Okay. And the other I just want to make a comment regarding the heart unit, and that is I just want to put in a perspective that this might be the best resource of funds, but I'm concerned about counsel, cherry picking services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My feeling is that the heart unit is part of a system, a consortium of care, and that's who needs to make the decision. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember, and thank you for that. That was definitely the best, most concise of the night. Thank you, Councilman Sabrina. Just Chase, I just want to say thank you for your work. Crime is down. Response times are down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're hiring more cops. We're hiring more firefighters. And you guys are doing a great job. So thank you. Okay, let me go out and take public comment on this issue as what I will also do is, believe it or not, we're still in the last year and we have even started the council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what we're going to do is right after this hearing, we're going to go round up public comment for the council meeting and then the full agenda for the actual council meeting. So it's I know it's difficult with all with this timing, so I apologize for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr.. Mr.. Goodhue, obviously the budget public comment on the budget and they're going to go right into public comment for the council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. And this follows up parenthetically some comments made earlier on a different subject. I'm going to read an email that I sent out to the chief, to the prosecutor and a number of you. So forgive me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I read it, the specter of such was brought into sharp focus over the last few days. My sense is a close examination will reveal that, notwithstanding the ill served Chief Luna's mantra, if you see something, say something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are those within his ranks and the dispatch center that do everything they can to discourage people from reporting crimes or reasons for reasons ranging from rank stupidity to laziness adding to the malignancy. The above have found a fellow traveler, in my view, in the Long Beach City Prosecutor, the above tolls to the imperatives of a federal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'master to oversee Long Beach police and the California Supreme Court's judicial review paradigm. If it is not suspended or revoked the city prosecutors license. It should be noted that the above is separate from the pending U.S. Department of Justice arrest, prosecution, conviction and imprisonment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The self inflicted mayor, selfie addicted Mayor Robert Garcia and a bipartisan U.S. circuit rebuked Camilla Harris. So rebuked for the epidemic of corruption. The former Willie Brown squeeze engendered said arrest and imprisoning, flowing from the criminal complicity of Garcia again to Harris's criminal conduct in the violent, wanton intercourse and destruction of Marine Stadium much needed support structure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to us. What remains to be seen is if the scope of the federal master purview will include include overseeing the entire city of Long Beach. A close order inspection of the revenue stream from the pen for the pending elections in Long Beach should prove to be instructive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for the next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Time and money. I've been here for five and a half hours. The person to whom I wanted to direct my comments just left this room. It falls under the category of safety. And I think the problem is idea and it's been discussed by the entire council to body cameras is great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It probably would have saved untold tens of thousands of dollars had they been warned on June 26th when one of your council members had an interaction with the police. I think there would be a lot less vague comments with regards to what happened, when it happened, what the timing was, because nobody seems to want to reveal this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'information. I'm a pharmacist, so I know a little bit about blood alcohol levels and I did a little bit of calculation. Alcohol was excreted from the body at a rate of 15%, 0.15% per hour. If indeed Councilman Pierce had 80 minutes of delay, her levels would have risen to .08 from the .06 that was reportedly measured.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would make her in violation of the law. Most citizens would be picked up. Even at the level she blew at the severely prolonged time in which it was administered. This speaks to the training. It is my understanding that there was a program put in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe the training was so that people with the record would be more clearly identified more quickly. But I'd like to speak to the 22 interviews and 300 hours that had to be put in such that the case could be put back to the L.A. district attorney so that it could be explored by the Integrity Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Waste. Unbelievable. Waste and cover up. And what a moral canvas for this city. This city. It's just amazing. And I have a great idea for you. On you seem to like to have first responder feet. So let's talk about this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People call about the homeless all the time. They won't press charges. They won't follow citizen's arrest. And so nothing happens. But if the homeless person manages to collect 24 of those citizen's arrest, then they get to go before the prosecutor, and then they get approximately 5 minutes jail time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The citizens need to know this. I see that. That's red. So I'm assuming I'm cut off.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any pressure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Charge them for it. If you get a call and have somebody come out because you don't like somebody standing on your porch or standing on your edge, your property, or they're over there doing something that you don't like and you won't press charges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Charge him for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, ma'am. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, Warren. Lisowski. Couple of comments on the budget hearing here. I've got a problem with the overall budget. I Councilperson Mhlongo alluded to this large binder 500 some pages, but I don't feel that the detail there is necessary to really analyze the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there's a website that you can click with some charts and stuff, but you really can't click through $100 Million line item here to find out where that money is really going in so many of the different department budgets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's operating transfers and interphone charges tends to raise hundreds of millions of dollars that citizens don't have access to. So I would propose that this council, in doing their budgets for public review, I don't know if it needs to be brownout compliant that we be able to really click through the budgets and find out where the money's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'really going. Now, the one area that you can click through is on this the staffing, the the wages and salary charts. And just a comment I had on the fire department. You've got 12 battalion chiefs for $200 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, 12 battalion chiefs at $2 Million. Do we need 12 battalion chiefs? I mean, if you cut that number down by just a few, you could go from 29 ambulance operators to easily double that number. And with respect to the Department of Justice's Budget Office, in their 2013 report regarding police, city of an average city spends $279'",
        "'speaker_3': 'per year per resident in Long Beach, spending $489 per resident. So I think there absolutely is to echo what Councilperson Price was saying, money in the budget for body worn cameras and the first responder fee. I apologize in my ignorance, this is the first I'm hearing it of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was not as vigilant, you know, watching this this body over the last few years as I probably should have been. But I'm really surprised that that type of regressive tax is being charged to somebody in need. We pay property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We pay sales taxes. God forbid somebody breaks something or gets in a car accident. And now they have to be worried about getting billed back $250 to collect $1.4 million of your $3 billion budget. It just really seems abusive and not a good way to raise $1.2 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just final thought, is that out of our $3.3 billion budget here, it really seems like only about 500 million that goes towards the general fund really gets discussed in this body. There's vast sums of budget that go through the harbor and the tidelands that I think should have the details that this does also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very angel. I'm speaking right now on behalf of the Jane Addams Neighborhood Association in North Long Beach, and I sent an email to all of you. And basically, we have concerns about crime. I mean, we talk to our police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a good relationship with the police. They come and speak to our organization. They tell us what's going on. There's always something going on and they encourage us to call. We go ahead and call. And they said, you know, sometimes we're just not going to be able to make it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have priorities. And so the priorities are the most difficult crimes. And so the crimes of maybe quality of life or, you know, maybe arguments between neighbors, whatever it might be, I mean, those won't even get addressed because there isn't time to address them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's only the most critical crimes that are getting addressed. So I think police and fire may be making do, but the truth is, is a lot is getting away from us because we don't have the resources to address them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I appreciate that they're doing everything they can to make do. But the truth is, it's not enough. And I think the community in the neighborhoods and business deserve more. And I understand it's expensive, but I also know that we spend a lot of money on other things that aren't nearly as critical as public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's important that that we address this. So we're asking, in fact, the neighborhood association is demanding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That we have more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Resources put toward police and public safety for the good to the neighborhoods. I mean, it isn't even safe to drive down the street anymore. We don't do traffic enforcement anymore. I see cars going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Through red lights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Concert. Gently. And that might seem, you know, maybe it's not a big deal. But I tell you, every time a car goes through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A red light, there's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An opportunity for a death and a devastating situation. So we're I don't see that we're even doing traffic enforcement anymore to any great degree. And the fact that we have people living almost caravans still.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Along our major corridors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because there aren't enough people to enforce or because we don't. I know that's being addressed a little bit later tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the fact that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been allowed to get to this point is really critical as well. So I'm just hoping that you'll pay attention to the needs of the neighborhoods and maybe it isn't bad or maybe it's improved in parts of town, but considered that maybe in other parts of town it isn't quite as good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we do need more resources. We appreciate the work that the public safety units are doing, but we need them more than what we have resources for. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening again, Greg. Average Eighth District. First, I would like to thank Council member Marengo for the questions that you asked. You didn't pose it as if everything.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great and I appreciate that because it isn't great. You know, I have two passions in this city and one of them, as you all.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Know, is the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Airport, but the other is public safety. I think that the responsibility of our government, whether it's at the federal level, the state level or local, is first and foremost public safety at the appropriate levels. Not at not at the level where the chief has to say, we'll do the best that we can do with what you give'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us. I think we've gone way past that. That's been the comment that's been set before the council for many years and not making do like Lori just referred to. You know, there's a brief history of back in the 1980s, we had a hiring freeze in the late eighties and crime was on the rise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there was a they coined the phrase white flight because crime was increasing. People were leaving. Then they had to hire additional cops to make up for that time that they had the hiring freeze and they hired many new officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually, those officers are now a year, maybe two years away from retirement. I know that PD has attrition rates of usually 30 to 35 a year. I would like you to ask, what are those numbers projected for 2018 to 2021?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During that time that as I read it, if I read it correctly, the budget projections for 2019 to 2021 are deficits of $10,000,009 million. So what do we do when we get there? Today, we have substations that are closed to the public after spending millions of dollars to bring community policing closer to our residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Today, we have 200 fewer officers than we did in 2009 to 2012. Today, we have an outdated citywide camera system when we spent millions of dollars to improve community safety. I know that Long Beach PD has taken on a study by the Institute and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I went to one of their two meetings that was held last week. It was poorly attended because it was poorly advertised, but they will return with their recommendations to to the police. And I'm going to guess that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Based on their best principles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They may even say that we're not capable or that we can no longer afford our own police department. He shared what they base their their percentages on, and we don't come close to it. So the more development we have, the more residents we have, the greater needs for visible public safety in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Today, Vons made a call. They had a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Man exposing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Himself and terrorizing the women that were taking over the new shift. It took 3 hours for a police officer to get there to the bonds in Bixby Knolls. Code Enforcement. I've been calling for three weeks and I still haven't had a response on a home that's abandoned and taken up by homeless people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have a lot of needs. I ask that you look at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Were with the number of police officers. Back when Mayor O'Neal took over, we were 791. Foster promised 100 more and had to cut. And today we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': '46.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fewer than we did when Mayor O'Neal took office. So please look at those numbers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. I'm cluelessly and I am from 307 to Knoxville in Long Beach and I'm here to speak on the Planning Commission and the latest appointment to the Planning Commission. I'm a member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're going to do that public comment right after the budget. Public comment, which will be right after these gentlemen over here. This is only on the budget. You want me to wait? Yeah, it's only on the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we'll get to the public comment in a minute. I think, Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I'm not I really wasn't here to talk about body cameras, but now that you have it, I'm going to get into this thing. Very controversial situation, body cameras. I was here maybe a couple of years ago when you got into it the first time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I it to me it was an overpriced deal. It was not a deal that you should have got into. There were some free goods involved. There's different things involved here. And it was not as bad as Los Angeles, I'll say that much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And frankly speaking, there are municipalities in this country, you who have litigation trying to break contracts on body cameras. There's been it's very controversial. Prices are ridiculous to the extent of, well, I'll be kind. I won't use certain words, but the charges down the road are going to be humongous and they're going to get worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you people have ignored certain things. And in many ways, I stopped trying to do business on security equipment three or four years ago on this with Long Beach. Maybe it's changed now, but I'll just say there are there are ways to overcome the humongous charges that you're going to get with your cloud situation on your present'",
        "'speaker_4': 'supplier. That's all I'm going to say on on this. I don't I don't want to say the wrong word. Wall Street jeer or jail roll up, uh, a lot of things about some of the scams going on in body cameras.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city of New York has had all kind of litigation. There's litigation all over the place about body cameras and Jim McDonald, I told when he got into office, be it be the last guy in stay away from body cameras as long as you can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to me, he's the smartest guy around. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next picture, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Franklin Sims, fourth District soprano was my councilperson. I just want to say that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very grateful for the work that the police chief and the fire chief are doing. I was very outspoken on Measure A and I was really happy to hear about this report as I was listening that I couldn't help but hear the hypocrisy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it kind of remind me that this cool guy named Jesus, you guys may have heard of him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And he said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why are you looking at the mote in your brother's eye but cares not for the beam in your eye? When I look at it, I agree with Powell. I think this is about our kids and making sure that our streets are safe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I remember talking to Chief Luna about what that meant during those tense discussions about Measure eight. And what he told me was that when he sends his force into.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tough neighborhoods, he said that the first line of protection wasn't a body cam. Wasn't cultural sensitivity or implicit bias. He said the first line was public trust. A lot of people here have reiterated that same claim. As a black man.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm having a hard time trusting right now because I think that if I was pulled over or stopped at 2:40 a.m.. And I was intoxicated. And a black woman was in the car with me. She was intoxicated. I'm having a hard time believing that I'm going to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Able to call a friend. This undermines the work that Chief Luna does. This undermines the public trust when his forces go out and they serve a warrant. And to access community, I ask community. Where's the public trust that they're going to get the same sweet deal that happened that early morning?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to get that same sweet deal where the police escort them home and the squad car. I want to be able to tell my daughter that maybe her husband's going to get a sweet deal like that one day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm not sure. Appearances matter. Perhaps white.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Privilege matters. There is no public trust.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the public can't trust the city council. Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So we are we put out an RFP for audit services. We got four responses. All of these responses use the standard method of compensation. They get a percentage of the savings. So there is no net outlay to the city, there is only a savings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again, the firm will get a percentage of the savings. We had a selection committee review the proposals and unanimously the committee unanimously selected a firm called Utility Cost Management UCM and that is our recommendation to award. And we would hope that when their work is done that there will be savings to the city and we would'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Take a look at our phone lines and other things. How does this how do we anticipate doing something like this before we move to the new civic center? Or is this an opportunity to save more money? To look at some of our other services in addition to electric?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we, in fact, are going to look at this. And then I would not be surprised if we find that it will be beneficial to move on to other services also. So I think you have a good idea.'",

I'm the Southern California representative of Troy and Banks, Inc, one of the bidders for this contract. I'm joined by Kathy State Cock, who's a Northern California state shark, who is the Northern California representative of Troy and Banks.'",

The RFP calls for and essentially the language is to identify and recover past overcharges. However, the contract awarded to the firm UCM does not provide for identifying and recovering past overcharges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For one simple reason Try and Banks is the largest company in the United States that identifies utility cost overcharges. It has recovered over $500 million in charges from for over 10,000 clients. It's the nation's leader in this business and what exactly is involved here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a four year lookback that looks at nearly $70 million of utility charges that Long Beach has paid the we object to the award for two UCM for three reasons. One, the bid price trillion banks is by far the lowest bidder, which you seem will have to identify a dollar 45 in savings compared to the dollar'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that Troy and Banks would get in order for Long Beach to break even. The you cannot audit utility bills unless you physically inspect every street light and every installation in the city. I will note that in the RFP at section 3.4, it calls for the bidder to examine and identify non-existent equipment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, the staff report drops that requirement. Now that may be in there in the contract someplace, but it is cost it is absolutely cost intensive to put a staff person into a city to count. That's what Troy and Banks does.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's how Troy and Banks found over 3700 missing street lights in the city of Buffalo, New York. They start this week for the same function in the county of San Diego. And one of the issues that that financial management raised in awarding this to you seem was that, well, you seem knows California Troy and Banks was selected'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I guess you go ahead. Go ahead. And can she give me her three minute?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We we don't do that. The only if that if the council wanted to vote and extend your time, that that would be up to them. But each person's 3 minutes but she definitely gets 3 minutes.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It's okay. If there's interest in that from the council, I'm happy to extend. Okay. So so I will give you an additional 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Go ahead. Appreciate that. That's all I'll need. The the issue is the price. The second is the scope of service. The scope of service provided by TRAI and banks is vastly superior to you. Seems you seem does not even have the experience or background.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In addition, Troy in Banks for six years has been the utility auditor for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. You seem has no experience with major airports and major commercial terminals and seaports. That's exactly what Troy and Banks does.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's why it was the number one choice. But as far as doing this audit, how do you audit a bill when you do not go out and physically check every single thing you're being charged for? And that is what the city of Long Beach will end up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If this contract with UCM is approved and Troy and Banks puts a team of 4 to 6 people inside the city, drives around, checks GPS, takes a look at everything. And that's what they're starting in San Diego this week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what was not. We tried to make this case to the financial management people and then we're told, well, you don't know California. And that's just simply not it. If this contract is approved, all we can say is that Long Beach will leave a lot of money on the table, because once you have resolved this audit'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, they point to a few customers in California that they have worked with a handful, maybe three or four cities, but they cannot provide a single example of success they have had with customers in California. Not one. Troy Banks is new to California and quite simply is not qualified to audit California customers.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'us to respond. Except for the time I've been given here. Here are the facts. You seem performs the most thorough, complete and sophisticated analysis of electricity costs available. We have we've provided ample references to support this statement. California has by far the most complex electricity regulatory environment, environment in the nation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We lead the nation with all the programs when it comes to electricity. You seem works in this environment every day. Troy and banks does not. So if they were to be retained by the city, a lot of what they would be doing would be new to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Troy Banks has never, not once appeared before the California Public Utilities Commission. This fact alone makes the firm unqualified to review the city's electricity charges. The CPSC approves every charge you pay. And in contrast, UCM has been involved at the CPAC for decades, has testified dozens of times before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The CPC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Regularly participates in Edison's general rate case process and has obtained over $20 million in refunds through the CPC process alone. We work with Edison and CPC personnel at the highest levels every day and this is what enables us to get results.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Simply put, UCM provides a far superior and different service for Edison customers than Troy and Banks. And I. I believe the record makes this clear. The city staff concurs, and I urge you to approve the recommendation to approve to retain utility costs management.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Can we make sure we find that out before we come back to council? And then specifically. And I'll happy to meet offline about this. I'd like to know. Why auditing the port or airport or whatever port of that was included was not included.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if it's different, why that's not included in the qualifications or how that was come about. I'm sure there's a staff logic to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can answer that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, wonderful. Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The the harbor is not under our direct control. That's. And the airport is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. But the airport was not included as a qualification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, it is it is included in our contract. That's what I was saying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And does the current recommended provider currently provide services to airports?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The current provider is currently auditing an airport. The the it is as far as I know, absolutely correct that Troy and banks has audited airports. That's my understanding. But we don't see that overall. We do not see that as an issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'm looking forward to doing more research over the next 30 days. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I actually, sir, that actually no, sir. Sorry. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Says we're heading down this path. I'll just ask I'd like to know if there was a bottom line difference between the two contractors. I mean, the whole point of order then to see if there's a return for the city, was there a difference?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because there were some claims here tonight that I was unaware of that state. The scope of what folks responded to might have been different, might have had different numbers. So either we can respond to that tonight or when it comes back, maybe an outline of who generates more money, because that's what it's about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'd also like to, you know, think about maybe we could talk offline, you know, what are the other opportunities? So we talked about phones, but what else like what else can we audit and take a look at?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it just seems seems interesting to me. Maybe it's an expertize, but I would imagine that within the scope of what the Auditor City already does, we should maybe have a list of things that the city doesn't do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we could take a look at those things. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's a motion and a second on the floor to lay this over for 30 days. Is there any other council comments on this case? None. Members, please go and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That completes a consent calendar. So this will be back in 30 days in front of the council, and I'm sure that staff will be in touch with folks that are involved in this. Moving on next as item three.'"

We just received the the housing and neighborhood grant from the state, and that's going to allow us to do two more playgrounds. So we've identified our playgrounds from the perspective of our health and safety needs first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we have a playground at Peace Park in the First District that is desperately in need of a redo. And so we're going to be able to do that with a grant. We also have a playground at Martin Luther King Park that will also be accomplished with that grant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we are continuing to look for other funding sources. We do not have anything identified in the second year of Measure A, and I don't believe the third year either for any future playgrounds. So we'll be continuing to look for outside grant funding to help us with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that's great. I think that's a really good idea. And we've we've talked a lot about making sure that we have kind of modern facilities throughout the city and modern amenities for all of the residents. So to the extent that we can, even if we need to put up some matching funds, I think that's really important'",
        "'speaker_8': '. But of course, the more we can enhance the areas that need it the most, the better. But if we can look at it from a citywide perspective, I think that would be great because I know that in some of the districts we've had some of the playground equipment fall apart and we've kind of, you know, improvised.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's pieces that don't really belong, but they're, you know, kind of tacked on to a slide and different color and everything. And so that starts to look a little shabby. So if we can try to no reflection at all on Prime, you guys do an amazing job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But if we can start to think about how we can enhance all the playground spaces, that would be great and maybe kind of how how much they're utilized. And and that that might be a factor that we put into the prioritization as well in terms of what park are being most utilized.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Orson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. This report and item is music to my ears. We've been advocating and working very hard to get new playground equipment at North Cerritos Park and Jackson Park and other parks for some time to councilmember price point. I think once these playgrounds are are put in place, it's going to kind of push the council to have to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do more in terms of improving the quality of our playgrounds, throughout in parks, throughout our parks, because these playgrounds are going to set a new standard for play equipment in our city. And so thank you. Look forward to having some world class parks and improvement on what we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I think that it's a good you know, when the council starts discussing additional imagery dollars in the future. I also think I'm a I love putting money to playgrounds. I think that is one of the best uses we could do for emergency funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we should talk about that, I think in the future. Any any public comment on this? Seeing none. Go ahead, members. Custer votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'"
