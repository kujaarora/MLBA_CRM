The Long Beach Fire Department delivers fire rescue, emergency medical services, marine safety response, hazardous materials response, and non-emergency response services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We provide a 24 hour operation 365 days a year. Our personnel are well-equipped and highly trained to mitigate all emergencies. The fire department strives to make Long Beach a better place to live, visit, work and own a business.'",

Over the past 12 months, we've responded to over 80,000 fire, emergency medical services, marine safety and other emergency incidents, a 5% increase from last year.'",

Included in this number are over 55,000 medical calls and over 7500 fire calls. This number has steadily increased over the years, approximately 35% since 2005, when the department had even more resources.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This number also includes hazardous material responses, airport responses and other non fire responses.

While nearly 100 fire personnel were in isolation. Our arson staff remained very busy. As a number of arson related fires continues to increase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Arson staff investigated 381 arson fires, which resulted in 78 arrests. These numbers continue to increase. One of the driving factors for this is the sharp increase in outdoor fires, specifically those near freeways and rivers. These types of fires have increased by 320% since 2018, from 199 to 637.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As in all fire responses. These fires require a large amount of fire resources for a prolonged period of time. In an effort to reduce the number of injuries to fire department personnel caused by heavy lifting. We have purchased and installed an innovative patient lift system on all of our ambulances.'",

This includes hotels, apartments and residential care facilities. To help us to meet these requirements.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Improvements to fire stations 11 and 13 are also planned. These addressed deferred maintenance as well as kitchen and bathroom renovations. Funding for Fire Station 14 will address workforce privacy needs, deferred maintenance and energy efficiency upgrades. Finally, the plan includes partial funding for the expansion of the David Rosa Regional Fire Training Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Improvements include additional space for classrooms and offices and workforce privacy renovations. The department will face several significant challenges in fiscal year 23. First, as I mentioned earlier, service demands, staffing levels, the pandemic and the types of calls that we see have led to firefighter safety and behavioral health concerns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Increased development, specifically vertical density in the downtown area and throughout the city will increase service demands, leading to an increase in emergency responses and response times. On a related note, the Department will also need to begin preparing for the upcoming emergency service demands brought on by the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, which will significantly increase the daily population'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the city. We have front line safety equipment that is nearing the end of their useful lives and are in need of replacement. Items such as the breathing apparatus that the firefighters use are due for replacement in the next couple of years at a significant cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The fire department will continue to explore additional grant funding for these items. Similarly, our first responders work 24 hour shifts, living in and responding from fire stations and marine safety facilities, some of which are old and have significant health and maintenance issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A plan for repair and replacement of these facilities, including identifying a funding source, will be necessary to respond to this challenge. Finally, wildfires throughout the region and the state continue to pose a challenge as they grow in size and frequency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have several opportunities coming up. First, while anticipated retirement of our leadership in the management and supervisory ranks creates somewhat of a challenge. It also is a great opportunity to develop the next generation of leadership. As I mentioned earlier, the fiscal year 23 budget proposes the continued support of the FIA diversity recruitment program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This structural funding provides a great opportunity for us to continue our short term and long term relationships and recruitment strategies with the goal of increasing the diversity of our staff throughout the organization. I want to again thank the City Manager and City Council for your continued support of this program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another opportunity is the potential for grant funding to support training for our specialized programs such as Hazardous Materials, Urban Search and Rescue Fiable Program and Airport Rescue and firefighting. As well as to support the acquisition of needed equipment, including breathing apparatus and personal protective equipment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Finally, we have an opportunity for improved efficiencies in the EMS system. We are working with our medical director in the Los Angeles County EMS Agency to explore the possibility of implementing alternate destination and telemedicine pilot programs. Thank you for for front for providing me this opportunity to present the fire department's fiscal year 23 budget.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Our police officers and professional staff have experienced increased anxiety and feelings of depletion, yet they return to work each day to serve our entire Long Beach community. They do this because their work has purpose. They do this because they are needed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Although some have chosen to leave the department or the profession altogether, the vast majority, the vast majority have chosen to spend their entire careers with the Long Beach Police Department. I believe this is because we're not your typical major city police department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're large enough to be a world class organization offering specialized services and innovative training, but small enough to maintain close relationships centered around problem solving and innovation. Our mental evaluation teams, quality of life teams and outreach programs such as neighborhood walks are excellent examples of how we listen, learn and respond to the needs of our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We know that we've made mistakes and we're not perfect. No person, no group, and no police department is. However, regardless of the circumstances or situation, the police officers and professional staff of this department continue to be here each day, providing a multitude of services to our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They listen. They engage. And they strive to enhance the quality of life for all people in our city. In the face of a nationwide pandemic, rising violent crime rates and unprecedented attacks on police officers, their commitment to serve is unwavering and inspiring.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They're always willing to do more to ensure everyone in our community has opportunity to thrive. Every year we discuss a variety of public safety services we provide, including emergency response and calls for service criminal investigations, including victim support and advocacy, and safeguarding our public while protecting critical infrastructure and key resource locations from international and domestic threats.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, we should also discuss the resources we dedicate to our many partnerships and collaborations, like working with the City Prosecutor's Office on Alternatives Incarceration. Partnering with community organizations such as TIP, the Trauma Intervention Program to provide support to people after critical incidents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Collaborating with the Fire Department and Emergency Communication Center to better link public safety responses. Or joining with our health department as part of the city's interdepartmental team addressing homelessness. These and so many other partnerships are the reason we're able to do the work that we do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Here you see the call volume we're currently experiencing, which further exemplifies how hard our officers are working. Year to date, officers have responded to over 100,000 calls for service, which is nearly 600 calls a day. Although we've had to make several operational modifications through the years, our response time to priority one or emergency calls continues to be'",
        "'speaker_9': 'one of the best in the nation at an average of about 5 minutes. Like many major cities, we experienced an increase in violent crime at the beginning of 2022. However, we remain focused and resolute. We developed strategies and our employees adapted to several operational changes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our efforts have resulted in a notable downward trend in violent crime. And after starting 22, 2022, with a 17.4% increase, we've now seen that number shrink to a 5.4% increase year to date. The accessibility of firearms has also contributed to some of the violence we're experiencing this year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our officers have worked vigorously to address gun crime in the illegal possession of firearms. Oftentimes, they do this at great risk to their own lives. As of June, we've had a 16% reduction in shootings, and we've made over 350 arrests for firearm related crimes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's an increase of 6% over last year. 51% of these arrests involve people forbidden by law from possessing firearms. And this year alone, officers have seized over 450 firearms, which includes a 23% increase in the recovery of personally manufactured firearms known as pimps or ghost guns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Moving into the second half of this year, we'll continue analyzing data, identifying trends and strategizing on creative ways to address gun violence and other crime. The most devastating crime we experienced is homicide. And while every homicide is tragic, we are not dissuaded and we continue to work toward bringing justice to the families and loved ones of victims'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Among our accomplishments, you'll see we have a homicide clearance rate of 77%. This is well above the national average, which is a park which is approximately a 50% clearance rate. There are many factors that contribute to our effectiveness in this area, including a rapid reaction and response by patrol officers, immediate follow up by our Special Investigations Division'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and the excellent investigative efforts of our homicide detectives. In addition, when communities trust the police, people are more inclined to become witnesses to violent crime. We understand this, and all of these factors combined are necessary to achieve the results we're seeing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd also like to highlight the work we've done to address dangerous, illegal street racing exhibitions known as street takeovers. Recently, the City Council supported our efforts and voted on a street takeover ordinance to assist us in combating this extremely hazardous trend.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In addition, the police department joined other agencies to work collaboratively and improve information sharing. We deployed extra resources to serve as a visual deterrent, and we conducted proactive traffic enforcement whenever we became aware of a pending street race street racing takeover event.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To date, our officers have issued 240 citations related to street racing takeovers. We've also continued our work supporting city efforts to address homelessness. Our community outreach response and enforcement model consists of quality of life officers, the mental evaluation team and Los Angeles County clinicians, along with many of our other partners, are doing amazing work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Year to date, they've offered services to over 5000 persons experiencing homelessness and have found temporary and permanent housing for over 200 people. The wellness of our employees is a top priority and must be supported through strategy and practice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're making tremendous strides in addressing employee wellness and overcoming the stigma associated with trauma in law enforcement. We've onboarded a new administrator to strengthen our worker's compensation and employee leave programs, and we're implementing a structured peer support program along with trauma resiliency training.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also recognize the intersection between employee wellness and community wellness, and we continue supporting trauma informed care in a variety of ways, such as having community liaison officers available on critical incidents, facilitating and coordinating responses from TIP volunteers, and engaging with our health department to provide emotional support to those impacted during a traumatic event.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can't discuss Officer Wellness without acknowledging that one of the biggest challenges facing law enforcement today is recruitment and retention. And unfortunately, the Long Beach Police Department is no exception. Staffing shortfalls in a diminished interest in the profession are plaguing our department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hiring, training and keeping police officers has never been more critical to the evolution and advancement of this organization. We're constantly assessing recruitment efforts and working to implement ways to reach future police recruit candidates, including those from underrepresented groups in law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've signed on to initiatives like the 30 by 30 campaign with a focus of increasing female representation to 30% by 2030. And thanks to the recruitment and hiring efforts of our employees, we've increased female representation in our next Academy class by 114% over the prior class.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've also continued our collaboration with civil service, working on new projects such as our newest recruitment tool, the HLB PD Fit Truck, which is now used to engage community and potential recruits at various events and parades. To help increase our communication, transparency and engagement, we've developed a community advisory committee to help inform and shape department policies, and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'we engage our neighborhoods through division, specific events and commander forums. Our Office of Constitutional Policing works to ensure practices match policy through ongoing collaborations, such as our Current Data Analysis Project with the Center for Police Equity. And our media relations team has created a communications plan to better engage the public by delivering information more efficiently and effectively'",
        "'speaker_9': '. We've increased our social media footprint and even created a daily crime blotter on our department website. As we move beyond the tumultuous past few years and as our city now experiences an economic health and public safety recovery, we realize that the Long Beach Police Department is well positioned to expand on past advancements and explore new transformational opportunities'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Today's FY 23 budget proposal reflects a unified vision for the department focusing and prioritizing in the following key areas crime and homelessness. Acknowledging and supporting employee and community wellness and enhancing internal and external communication models. Built on a foundation of accountability, trust and transparency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Although we're proposing many unique and creative changes, the police department's structural budget request for FY 23 our cost neutral to the general fund offset by a strategic reorganization that realigns the Department budget and operations to address current and anticipated needs and provides a more efficient coordination of police services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To fulfill this vision. Significant focus and structure are needed. That's why I'm proposing the creation of a new bureau in our department.

        "'speaker_9': 'police department and the public. Kerry will be responsible for many of the programs and partnerships that currently promote these goals. And the new bureau will consist of two divisions the Community Outreach Response and Enforcement Division and the Youth and Community Services Division.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Kerry will prioritize efforts aligned with disrupting primary factors of crime through relationship based community policing models. To accomplish this, we propose the addition of 20 new police officers comprised of 16 new bike officers, four per patrol division assigned to divisional areas such as open spaces, parks and corridors or any areas in the division with immediate public safety'",
        "'speaker_9': 'needs and for additional quality of life officers to augment our citywide efforts to address homelessness. These four quality of life officers will join our current cadre to form two officer teams. Each team will represent a specific patrol division while also maintaining the ability to work as a single quality of life officer when necessary.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For altogether as an entire eight officer quality of life unit for large citywide operations. All 20 police officers will be able to respond to calls for service and service patrol officers as well. Youth engagement is critical to successful public safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Department proposes moving the Community Engagement Division under the CRC Bureau and renaming it the Youth and Community Services Division. Additionally, we propose to structurally fund a police cadet program of up to five cadets annually. The cadet program will introduce law enforcement careers to young adults and help establish a pathway for future PD, police officers and civilian'",
        "'speaker_9': 'employees, all while providing paid work experience to our community's younger demographic. We're proposing additional department adjustments to assist us in supporting community needs and organizational growth while providing fair, just and ethical policing in our city. Will accomplish this by expanding the scope of the Internal Affairs Division and renaming it the Professional Standards Division.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The division will add a new professional development section with two new civilian police investigators, while the Internal Affairs section will continue investigating allegations of misconduct. The Professional Development Section will focus on employee development and professional success to reviews of early warning signs and identifying areas for improvement through retraining or counseling.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To better reflect the mission of being a data and form department, we proposed reorganizing and renaming the Administration Bureau to the Strategic Initiatives Bureau. Under the Strategic Initiatives Bureau, the Office of Constitutional Policing, OCP will be expanded from three four years to nine FTEs transferred from other divisions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This increase in OCP staffing will help us broaden their scope to include the manual orders and policy section responsible for ensuring policies are aligned with legal mandates, best practices and community expectations. Also under strategic initiatives were adding two administrative aid positions to the Public Records Compliance Division.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Their workload is increased by 46% since 2019, and it's expected to continue to increase based on legal mandates. Effective communication shapes both the delivery and perception of services we provide. That's why I'm proposing a communications division which reports directly to the chief of police.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The communications division will include our current media relations team and executive communications administrator. In order to replenish our ranks. We're currently recruiting candidates for back to back to back police academy. Class 96 begins on August 29th with 59 recruits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Class 97 is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2023, and we anticipate being ready for a third class sometime in FY 24. In addition, we're proposing a new administrative analyst position to focus on expanding inclusion and advancement efforts and to further support labor relations and move new initiatives forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A clean and professional workspace for our personnel is central to maintaining a workforce that feels respected and valued. This budget proposes increasing the hours of current staff and adds two new part time employees so we can provide evening and weekend custodial services at our facilities that operate 24 hours a day and seven days a week.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Finally, responsibility in the Business Operations Bureau has grown significantly and now includes oversight of department fleet and body worn camera programs. We propose adding a contract and grants officer to provide dedicated oversight in support of department wide operations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In addition to structural programs funded through our operating budget, I'm grateful to the Mayor and the City Council for their proposed additional investments in public safety, including funds for two years of outreach and cleanup along the river beds and additional overtime funds for crime and violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additionally, as part of the city's new five year infrastructure plan, we're thankful to receive one time funds necessary to start the rebuild of our police academy. An initial funding for a new crime and evidence lab. The challenges ahead must be met with sufficient resources to manage the rigorous pace of requests and expectations that exist in today's law'",
        "'speaker_9': 'enforcement environment. We've weathered some of the most dramatic increases in violent crime in a decade. A stream of unfunded legislative mandates with unworkable timelines and antiquated technology and paper processes that hamper operational efficiencies. This, in addition to an already exhausted, stressed and disillusioned workforce, exasperate the challenges.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But in these challenges, we find opportunity. The ability of our employees to serve through crisis and remain vigilant during difficult times is impressive. Yes, I'm concerned about our capacity for the challenges ahead, but I'm also encouraged by the service and resilience of this department and all those that work here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We look forward to developing new strategies that promote relationship based policing, models that engage our community and that build partnerships to reduce crime and improve everyone's quality of life.

        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor and members of City Council. It's my pleasure to present to you the Department of Parks, Recreation, Marine and Animal Care Services 2023 proposed budget. The proposed budget will allow our department team members to continue passing forward their passion to bringing joy to all from infants to older adults and our companion dogs and cats'",
        "'speaker_9': '. The department's key services are aligned to implement the Department's Strategic Plan, which was adopted by City Council earlier this year. The Strategic Plan focuses on park equity, community identified goals, values and actions to guide operational staffing and budgeting decisions through the department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Department is committed to providing a vibrant park system where everyone is welcome and can thrive. Our dedication is further reinforced by performing maintenance and stewardship for all of our parks, facilities, beaches and open spaces. We're very proud to further promote responsible pet ownership and the humane treatment of animals in alignment with our Compassion Saves model.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Saving every treatable animal that comes into our shelter requires significant resources, and we work hard to provide care for our furry friends.

        "'speaker_9': 'The department has the capacity to contribute to the local economy by having events at our facilities, parks and on our beaches. The scope of how large our department is and the diversity of the amenities and services we offer take a strong, supportive workforce at the peak of our busy summer season.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our department is a local workforce powerhouse, employing over 700 staff, many of whom are experiencing their first job ever. We're extremely proud of the many accomplishments this past year, including the completion of our strategic plan. All year, staff collaborated with our partners, provided recruitment and training of our employees, and processed thousands of permits and reservations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Staff also secured 11 park grants totaling over $28 million. Grant funds afford us the opportunity to provide community services, new amenities, and new and improved parks. I'm happy to report that Animal Care Services reached a very high adoption rate of 60% and achieved a live release rate of 92%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our increased focus on the FOSTER program has resulted in many positive outcomes. This could not be done without our dedicated staff, volunteers and community partners. As our department eases out of COVID restrictions and we see our programs returning to pre-pandemic levels, we're very proud of these accomplishments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've implemented violence prevention programs for youth through the Long Beach Recovery Act and provided free in-person programs for youth and seniors, as well as camps when schools are out on break. Once again, we participated in a great partnership with Long Beach Unified School District to offer meals to school age children by the end of this summer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that provided 54,000 meals to youth through the summer food program and an additional 62,000 meals to seniors this year. Through our senior nutrition program, our department stretches across the entire city and is able to serve all of our Long Beach communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As a department, we continue to focus on enhancing park access throughout the city and improving our parks, open spaces, beaches and marinas. We've been very busy this year with reopening Lincoln Park and Harry Bridges Memorial Park, celebrating two new playgrounds at Recreation Park and Colorado Lagoon, as well as a new floating playground at Alamitos Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also introduced beach access mats at Alamitos, Granada and mother's beaches. A big thank you to our collaborative partners at Public Works Department and the beaches and marinas. We maintained a 94% marina slip occupancy rate and successfully performed the annual beach renourishment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We completed 4500 maintenance work orders to repair and improve facilities, grounds and equipment in addition to upgrading irrigation and the landscape of Daisy Lane. And transformative improvements at Sunnyside Cemetery. Well, we are extremely proud of all our accomplishments this year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're very excited about the proposed investments for fiscal year 23.

A team of six maintenance assistants and a supervisor will be able to lock gated mini parks and all freestanding restrooms at night.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At 39 parks, this innovative approach will promote cleaner and safer park restrooms. The proposal allocates park ranger funds of $575,000 in the police department and incorporates the budget into a larger initiative and approach in the Parks, Recreation and Marine Department.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'The Park Safety Ambassador Program will offer expanded coverage and maintenance of parks, allowing staff to lock gates and restrooms, making observations regarding overall park etiquette, encampment activity and the presence of graffiti to enhance this program. The budget proposes one time funds of $600,000 for new park restroom infrastructure upgrades and door replacements with automated time locking doors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This investment will further support safe and secure park restrooms. This initiative will involve citywide collaboration with several other departments for the most strategic coordination of resources, safety for staff and residents, and synergy with the citywide collective approach towards addressing public safety.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additionally, new positions will further support the Clean Restroom and Safe Playgrounds initiatives. For maintenance assistant positions will be added to support core services in park facilities. Also proposed is additional staffing to monitor park usage and permit compliance to ensure patrons are aware of and adhering to park regulations such as the recently adopted Kids Zone Ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Overall, this plan would take the city from 3.5 FTE covering five parks to 12.3 budgeted positions, covering 39 parks and funding for restroom infrastructure upgrades. These strategic investments aim to enhance the cleanliness, safety and the welcoming quality of our parks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm happy to say that the proposed budget includes enhancements and one time funding for maintenance. Urban forest management will be enhanced with funding of $400,000 to establish a seven year cycle of tree trimming. The budget also includes a one time resource of $1.8 million for dead tree removals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In our efforts to address weed abatement in a more environmentally friendly way by eliminating the use of glyphosate in parks, funding to support using alternative herbicides will positively impact the quality of our grounds, maintenance and landscaping. To keep parks and open space usable and clean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Each year we deploy services for special park cleanups to address encampments, illegally dumped items and other waste. We're happy that one time funds are proposed to continue and enhance these essential services next year. The proposed budget also includes a structural investment in water for irrigation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This allows us to keep our parks green due to previous water rate increases and increase irrigation levels for healthy park landscapes. These maintenance investments align with our strategic plan and are a critical part of providing safe and accessible public spaces.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other proposed critical investments are in our Animal Care Services Bureau. The proposed budget adds staffing in several critical areas. It adds for maintenance assistance to provide increased shelter. Custodial services. Internal and external customer service will be enhanced through realign clerical positions and an upgrade of our volunteer leadership position.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To advance. Compassion saves a budget increase of nearly $500,000 for contract. Veterinary services will support the medical costs needed for animal care services. This investment will help save lives and increase positive outcomes. Our strategic plan highlights the need to offer meaningful recreation programing and events.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Long Beach Recovery Act funding will continue to allow the department to provide violence prevention programs such as Be Safe Hoops after Dark Mobile Recess and other teen programs, as well as senior fitness programs. Investments in our aquatic facilities will keep pools open for residents, community groups and visitors, which can also generate revenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The budget adds a general maintenance assistant for pool maintenance and one time resources for pool equipment. With the aging infrastructure of our pools, these strategic investments will greatly benefit our users. We work hard to provide access to healthy recreation opportunities in safe environments for the community's youth teens, adults and seniors who use our programs throughout Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Within the next half decade, over $97 million are proposed to be invested in our parks and recreation facilities as part of the proposed budget. A new five year infrastructure plan includes many park projects such as new playgrounds at Hartwell, Howden and Silverado Parks and Park Improvements at 14th Street, Cesar Chavez and MacArthur Parks, just to name a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'few. The plan also includes facility improvements and animal care services, several park community centers and the Martin Luther King Jr pool. Other infrastructure projects in the plan will support improvements to green belts, park restrooms. And our community gardens.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other projects in the plan include improvements to athletic courts, fields and turf. We're delighted to have so many park projects included in the new infrastructure plan. Even with many strategic investments next fiscal year, there are still challenges. Deferred maintenance, along with the continuing impact of vandalism and the abuse of our facilities, continue to be challenging.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We collaborate with our partners to address the safety, health and environmental concerns related to people experiencing homelessness in our parks and on our beaches. These challenges must be addressed to enable us to provide core services and safe facilities for our community to enjoy while remaining empathetic towards the unhoused.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Keeping our spaces clean and safe takes a lot of resources. With rising costs for equipment, services and materials, maintenance of our facilities and grounds requires our department to prioritize resources. Given that our services are deployed in parks, beaches and waterways, environmental sustainability and climate change are serious issues that the department must keep at the forefront of future'",
        "'speaker_9': 'planning. We are proud stewards of our natural areas that are home to urban wildlife. We continue to consider animal health and well-being as the foundation for all we do at Animal Care Services. It is a challenge to provide every animal daily care and enrichment according to their needs and in alignment with compassion saves.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of course, all of our services cannot be provided without people. Our department is a people driven department. Recruitment and retention of a diverse, dynamic and skilled workforce is paramount to our service delivery. It can be a balancing act of resources to strategically address critical priorities while looking to the future.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I thank the city manager for including in the proposed budget strategic investments, which help to address many of these challenges. With challenges do come opportunities. New projects, parks, playgrounds and equipment provide us with the opportunity to address unmet needs of the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Community engagement is a cornerstone of park equity in that it helps us learn where and how we can make strategic investments that will benefit our communities. Parks, stewardship and partnerships continue to prove to be very beneficial for our department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Seeking and successfully obtaining grants helps us to offer scholarships for programs and classes, beautification of our park spaces and future park development for our great city. New revenue generation can help to offset costs of services. However, we must be cognizant when setting fees.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To be sure, essential park programs are affordable, equitable and accessible. We'll continue to explore more partnerships, collaborations and funding opportunities. Our participation in the Lower L.A. River Recreation and Park District is another opportunity to help promote open space and connectivity for the benefit of our community, as well as other communities along the lower L.A. River.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'By increasing inner jurisdictional coordination and maximizing our resources. Development of master plans provides with community provided with community input on its needs and wants. Strategic plans, vision plans and feasibility studies have all been useful tools to really look at how a park meets the needs of a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Parks provide many benefits to the community, such as encouraging physical activity, improving health and fitness, and mitigating against air pollution. We look forward to optimizing these opportunities to create a park system for all. After all, people make parks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Parks make Long Beach and parks make life better. Honorable Mayor and Members of City Council. I thank you for your continued investment in Parks, Recreation, Marine and Animal Care Services. Your support helps us meet the needs of the communities across our city, our dedicated employees, and I thank you for your support.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this concludes my presentation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. We are available to answer questions on any of the presentations.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, honorable mayor. Vice Mayor, Council. I'm Natalie Gonzales. Long Beach City Employees Union President for iam local 1930. As you've already heard, we have critical staffing shortages in almost every department and are at risk of no longer being able to provide essential city services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Members are working overtime hours on a mandatory basis in a number of divisions, one of which is under investigation now. Our members have been given more duties and less resources, more stress and less compassion. This continuous and accelerated loss of institutional knowledge impacts our efficiency through low morale and elevated call outs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't continue to place the burden on our backs to subsidize the mission of our city with our mental and physical well-being, our family time, or with our pocketbooks. We hear all the time about the cost of paying employees more, but no one seems to discuss the costs of not paying us proper wages.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Simply put, we're asking you to put in cost of living adjustment to your budget for our members. In addition, we're asking you to invest in keeping your current employees. Now, recruitment without appropriate retention policies is ineffective. Retention is investing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We spend money on recruiting and training for members to leave. And then we started zero again. City budgets are the guys we use to invest in the issues we value most. We can talk numbers, we can talk line items in a budget, but we're more than just at ease on your Excel sheet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm asking you to be bold, take the long view on this budget. I applaud your investment in infrastructure, but remember the people who deliver the work. I know the challenge is never easy, but the cost of inaction is severe and I am happy to take questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for your time today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Mayor.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And psychological harm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even at the best of times, with these chronically extended hours, this job has become a danger to our bodies. 15 of our 31 employees on the PD side of communications have some level of medical restrictions, some of which are severe.'",

We're here to support our colleagues and to ask for your support as well. I was hired in November of 2012 as part of the city's first attempt to consolidate both call centers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were understaffed then, and we're understaffed now. We went from working 18 hour mandatory to 16 hour mandatory. Aside from working the weekly 16 to 24 hours of overtime, my center also suffers from having to work on our days off.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Underpaid and overworked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's now at a point where we are terrified to get behind the wheel and drive home after our shifts. Some even like to sleep in the dorms because it gives us more sleep. We go our workweek without seeing our families having to pay for extra childcare and meals for ourselves and families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yet, even with the overtime, we're still not meeting the state requirements. California requires that 95% of all night long calls be at within 15 seconds. However, we're falling short of that and too that at a rate of just about 77% for 2022, approximately 4% of our 7000 calls this year are.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'You retell. I personally have my wife call 911 yesterday and we had about a minute before she reached a dispatcher. I helped the man keep from getting stabbed by a woman armed with the kitchen knife. This is a terrifying reality for residents such as myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We stay committed to serving the constituents of Palm Beach. However, our pleas for help have been continuously ignored by city management and has now become detrimental to our health and those experiencing an emergency in our city.

There's dispatchers that have families and children to take care of, along with others that take care of older, disabled adults.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'in community and social services. That very same report also stated that they were looking for police officers to explore higher standards of education and also look at methods of exploring anti-racism and also racial sensitivity. Yet none of that was referenced in the budget meeting today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know there was a lot about professional development, a nice social media post and a nice mobile cart for community events. But there is no commitment to anti-racism. There's no commitment to acknowledging that black lives do matter in the city of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Good evening. About this budget here, I can commend the fire department and all the things that they're going to. I agree to that. The police budget needs to be stripped because they only make up 2% of our community, yet they get 50% or more the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that really doesn't make any sense because like I said, they only make up one or 2% of the community. They only stop 1% of violent crimes, rapes, murders, so on and so forth. The other 50% of the time, they're nonviolent crime, and 50% of that time is actually even write a report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what are they really doing besides hassling intimidating people and dragging people out of their homes because they're living on the riverbed and living on the street because we don't have enough affordable housing. I spoke last week again about building houses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not you have units available until the city comes to terms with the fact that the reason why we have crime, drugs, if people want to talk about those things, is because we're failing people at a level and not giving them take care of their basic human needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How about even a toilet? The bathrooms being locked, where people are being locked in and or they're happy to defecate and urinate on the street? Come on. Police budget cut at fire department. Given that the Parks and Rec.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, do that thing too. But in the meantime, in between time, y'all need to get straight with this. What was that? The housing envelopment law that was established in 1969. What it made, it mandated for the city to provide housing for all of their community residents.'",

So, first of all, on this item of the budget, I really wish that actually the mayor was here to listen to the community's concerns, because, I mean, a mayor has so much you know, he doesn't vote, but he does, you know, sign and kind of serves as the voice of'",

        "'speaker_1': 'money here in Long Beach and how he wants to use money, how he wants to get to D.C.. So I'm very concerned about that because like, look at all of these numbers. Like, people you you know, you guys are bringing up, oh, there is the fires on the highway and it's next to the river.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you're implicitly obviously blaming the unhoused people, right? So that's what you're doing. You're attacking those who are suffering under the system, and that's just egregious. What we actually need is a major investment in the community, in housing and education.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And why are we not talking about that again? Why is he not here to talk about how he's going to deliver for these things for us in Congress? Why? You know, why is that? Come on. We need housing that's truly affordable.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'That consistently.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I was disappointed in the police budget before and it's really disappointing now to know that 40% of our city budget is not even getting to the front lines and the dispatchers who run the department. So you would benefit by focusing on crime prevention and to prevent crime, you should expand investment into the root causes of crime, which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are poverty, pollution, lack of education, high unemployment, discrimination of all kinds, social inequities, and lack of opportunities that cause crime. But police don't prevent it. They respond to it. They investigate it. Sometimes they solve it. It's really frustrating to hear the police budget expand year after year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And once again, it's not reaching the people who are kind of. Responding. So when crime is up, police tell us they need more money to fight it. When crime is down, they tell us they need more money to keep the peace.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then we see spending on tear gas and we see spending on armored vehicles and helicopters and lots of things that are buzzy and exciting, but obviously neglecting the people. So I encourage you to think about that and really focus on root causes.'",

        "'speaker_1': '? You know, if it's averaging $90 per barrel and it had been budgeted for 55, uh, back of the envelope estimates is that that's a yearly surplus of about $200 million.

        "'speaker_2': 'I would point out that you can save money by doing less. And a great place to do less is in our parks. You don't need to be mowed. They don't need to be edged as we watch constantly. They don't need leaf blowers in them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every second a leaf could fall, you know, and it would still be okay. Sections of the park could be returned without batting bright green lawns, especially on artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But even the lawns could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Be restored as natural meadows. So if you, you know, and that saves a lot of money and it saves a lot of water. So that's just one suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then my man can thank you for your time as a service. Our next speaker. Steve Hoy. Your time begins now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Good evening. Hopefully you can hear me. My name's Boy. I live in the third district Marine Stadium. Just wanted to share an incident last Monday that we had at our home where we had a man climb up our fence in our backyard, threatened to kill us as we were sitting in back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was only that our dog saw the man and started barking, that he stopped jumping over. And I wanted to just report that it took the police nearly an hour to arrive to to our home. And unfortunately, the man was never found.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He had gone behind the boathouse lane building. So our guests were with us for my son's wedding from South Africa. He immediately asked where we had our gun, which we don't have, and he mentioned that the response time was rivaling his third world country policing response times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just wanted to just reiterate the importance that we support our police, both financially and in the work that they do is vitally important. And as we hear people talking about defunding police and all that's really doing is discouraging our officers, I have three friends that are officers that are all can't wait to retire because of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the environment. So I think we need to get behind them. We can we can find alternative policing ideas. We can solve root causes that people have talked about, but we have to support our police. So I urge you to do so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That concludes public comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And we'll take it back behind the rail. First of all, thanks to everyone who came out and spoke during public comment. It was very well attended. And thank you all for your service to our city and to chiefs Espino and he Bish and Brant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great job on your presentation. I'll just add a couple of notes, then I'll go through go through the council comments. We have five or six council members queued up on fire. I'll just say, you know, thank you for the accomplishments that you listed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm interested in continuing to follow particularly, you know, this progression to now fully funding or structurally funding the firefighter diversity program. That's a program, you know, that is important. And the council will pay some attention. And I remember when we began funding that with one time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we want to continue to see the progress. Best of luck there. We also want to continue to understand and see progress on the Junior Lifeguard program, which I know is now connected to North Long Beach and other areas of town on, I would say Chief he bish it's this is your first budget as as chief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I definitely see your fingerprints all over this thing. Some of the things that you mentioned early on when you expressed your interest in and you became chief and you talked about better communication, and I see that you've, you know, presented a new you know, a new apparatus around communication, your passion for community and community engagement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this new bureau, the collaborative response and engagement, I think that's a good thing. And I would encourage you to continue to invest and see how we can build trust and congruence and partnership with the community. I love that you now have named the Community Engagement Division, the Youth and Community Services Division.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we used to do things like police, athletic leagues and, you know, you know, the power center and things like that. And I think this is a step back in that direction, which is great. I think Professional Standards Division states very clearly that you have a goal of being a best in class, the police department, and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that it takes not just investigating when things go wrong, but investing in mental health and professional standards and training as you move forward. So. So I want to just recognize those things in your budget. I also just want to want to note that, you know, I'm glad to see the community policing investment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's something that's been important to the city council. I, you know, the community walks was something that, you know, I witnessed and participated in in North Long Beach and fully support this this city wide expansion of this program, along with the quality of life onward to the Parks, Recreation and Marine Branch.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we're you know, you're building a lot of a lot of respect in the community. And I saw you last night at the hoops after dark lunch, and you have a true passion for the community. I think that's evident in what we see here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say we should continue to invest in you know, we talk a lot of times during the summer about budgets and programs like that, but then sometimes the community comes out and says, that's great, but we also want this right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's been very, very clear that whoops, after Dark is a program that that needs the city's focus, its ongoing focus. So we want to continue to support that program and see how we can expand it to other groups across town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'd love to see some moves after dark on the West Side or North Long Beach. So it's a great program, but I think the highlight in this budget is the focus on clean restrooms and safe playgrounds. This is something that I can tell you is a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fact that we can't we don't have the ability today to lock our bathrooms at night sometimes since we can't, you know, there have been situations since we couldn't lock them. They just stayed locked all day while people are using the park during the day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't think that's okay. And and we invest in our restrooms and it seemed like two months, three months later, they're back in bad shape. So I think it's going to be smarter for us to be able to invest in keeping our bathrooms clean and safe and our playgrounds as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just offered those brief comments. I'll you know, if I have further questions, I'll be sure to follow up with you in our briefings. We're going to go through the counsel list I have. I'm going to read off the list first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have Councilwoman Sara, Councilmember Urunga, Councilmember Price, Councilmember Austen and Councilmember Mongo in that order. So, Councilman Zoro, you're recognized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson. I also want to thank Fire Chief Espino and Chief Heber and Mr. Brant Dennis for the great presentation. I know that there's so much more in your budget than you could possibly present in the short frame of the time that you have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I encourage those who felt like it wasn't enough as far as an opportunity to have dialog to come out to our community budget meeting. That's going to be this Thursday, August 11th, as well as next week in the following week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there is a lot and I just want to just start out by saying how much I appreciate seeing the investment in infrastructure for our fire department around equipment, as well as making sure that we invest more in diverse recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really important, and I know that the fire department's been working hard on making sure it's diverse in gender, racial and ethnic and ethnicity as well. And the other thing I want to also congratulate Chief Heber on is six months, I think is about six, seven months that he's been chief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that it really shows that you are being creative with the budget we have. I agree with the vice mayor that it's important we see investment in community policing because it is about engagement and building relationship with the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think more so that that you're kind of switching up the restructuring in so many ways. That's really emphasizing around the thing I know we've had ongoing discussion about around transparency, accountability, and that shows because you're making huge investments in communication because that reduces and that increases in transparency by sharing more about what's happening on a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'regular basis, not just social media, but newsletters and emails and also getting boots on the ground and our police officer out in the community to build their relationship and to get to know the beats in the community as well as our businesses too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also making sure that officers are reflective of those who are the community that they're walking in as well. So I really appreciate the creativity that's being taken around how you're doing engagement. And I see that and I appreciate it because that's some of the stuff that I've been I know that has been asked for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the other thing I want to note is that, you know, we've come a long way in thinking we are going to go into a $36 million deficit to now closing that. And so I do appreciate all of our city staff figuring out how to make sure we continue to provide the services we do, but also make'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sure we consider how we appreciate staff at all levels for their service and the work that they put in, especially as we continue to recover from the pandemic. And just want to make sure to comment around parks, Rex, Marines and Animal Services how much that is also part of our public safety continuum because it is part of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our violence prevention based on the whoops after dark program that was just mentioned by the vice mayor, as well as many other services and program to making sure we activate our parks, to making sure that we get young people and our elders out into the park doing programing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that, you know, the investment plan that's been shared is really making sure that we continue to get people to come out and be in our parks keeping it clean. I'm just really proud of how much that's going to be invested in improving MacArthur Park, thanks to Senator Lena Gonzalez, as well as making sure we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'create a vision plan bill, a dream for King Park. This coming very soon and where we want to hear back and how we can make this place the park better that work for everyone. Getting the funding we need to finally finished building the Kim the Killing Field Memorial Garden with the Cambodian Veteran Memorial Monument to making sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there's a place for Cambodians to remember the genocide and honor those who have passed. So there's just so much to this budget that I think is about adding and adding to values and adding to people's lives and adding to culture and also making sure that we connect more in person than we do online.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what our parks do for us as well. So there's much more, does it definitely say about the budget? But I just want to thank staff. All your hard work and then it day in and day out every all of our city staff, you really do make our city run and and definitely make it better.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Urunga Thank you, Ms.. Mayor. And I want to thank also staff for the great presentations you brought forward today. A lot of information in there. And I think it really shows that they're listening. You're listening you're listening to the comments that city council members have made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know we meet on a regular basis talking about what our region is and what our needs are and what we see or what we would like to see from each department in terms of their services and the the infrastructure and the hiring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And. And one of the things that came out tonight in terms of the public comment, it was a recurring theme. And the recurring theme was about retention. And it's something that is very important, obviously, to our employees. And and I hear it as well from the from the unions themselves, police included, how they feel, stressed how they'",
        "'speaker_7': 'feel on the and on. And I'm not saying undesired. What's the word I'm looking for? Unwelcome talk, don't talk. But, you know, the point is that I think nothing says about retention than salaries. And I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think we might want to look at.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It and i guess it would be directed more to the city manager and to our h.r. Director. In terms of when was the last time that we did a compensation study for our for our salaries in the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because I know we continually it seems like the year in, year out, we're at the lower part of the median as opposed to being at the median in salaries. And we can't I mean, a city our size with all of the resources that we got, with everything that we've got going for us, which is great and we're'",
        "'speaker_6': '. A great city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're still, you know, either at the at the median or below in our salaries that we pay our employees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Think that we need to finally address that somehow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the next.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I'm not saying it's English because that's not something that we could do right away. But obviously start looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How we can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Raise our level of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quality of our salary to get more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Retention.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People just want to work with us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I've seen and I heard it today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, employees who've worked for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, 15, 20, 30 years with the city and yet, you know, they're capped out, but they continue to work with us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are, of course, others who left us because there's no growth there for them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think we really have to start looking more seriously at and how we can provide better retention.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Services, if you will, for our employees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And of course, salaries is a big part of that. I mean, you feel good when you going to work and you get a nice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Paycheck where you can go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Back home and entertain your kids or buy them a nice dinner. So I think we need to look at that again. In regards to a compensation study, perhaps, Mr. Walker, you might want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at that. And when was the last time we did one, do you recall?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So as we did negotiations with our contract with AM, I believe was in around 2018, we did some preparation as part of that. If you remember in Closed Session, we talk a little bit about where we are in terms of the marketplace.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are currently in a long term agreement. We just did a I think a 2% increase just last year. We've got a 2% increase for our IAM staff coming up in September and then there's another 1% increase coming up in April of 2023 and then the contract ends after that and it'll be a chance to look at'",
        "'speaker_7': 'some additional negotiation. But we can get you the specific information on compensation study believe that does if it's any different than what I told you. You know, I think that, you know, we should do one of those studies every five years or so since our economy changes so much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's in flux at that point to keep up with what's going on in the real world in regards to how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Far a person's salary can go in terms of their quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But other than that, you know, I love the presentation for Parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From Police.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Fire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All the great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Things that they're doing out there in terms of retention, freeze at recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Partner retention.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I mean, we still need a lot more to do it. Obviously, we're we're making some gains in some of the restructuring and reorganization that's going on in all three departments in regards to answering the call for needs that the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Residents want to see is great.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I'm looking forward to further discussions with the budget. This is just a first.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Review at it, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know there's going to be some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Deeper, more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In-Depth discussions about more specifics as we get as we go with with the the study that equipment has. So I'm looking forward to that as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So a couple of things. I'll start in the order that we did our presentations tonight. So for fire, you know, I wanted to talk to the chief a little bit about the increase in activity in Alamitos Bay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are getting more and more calls for service in Alamitos Bay, and this is mostly a lifeguard response issue, but also a marine patrol issue. So I wanted to talk to the chief and perhaps the PR director on how this budget reflects the increase in boating activity in the bay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that may not be an issue that affects everyone, but it certainly is an issue that affects a lot of residents and renters who maybe don't have the money to have their own boat, which is most everyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're doing a lot of the rental businesses. And so that conflict has really come to fruition in a big way in Alamitos Bay. And I kind of want to get a sense from the chief and perhaps even director Dennis, how does your budget reflect that increase in activity?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I really didn't see that reflected in the proposed budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman, for your question in regards to our budget currently. I can tell you that we have currently.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hired up a security.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Company to help us out there. Now, let me just Bay, specifically with the with it and the activity that we're getting after. Dark Chief Medina actually came up with the idea, and I think it's a fantastic idea to get somebody to dissuade those folks from being out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it is a team approach. The security guards are only meant to identify folks that aren't supposed to be there when they're there. And then we notify PD. They come in and they assist us as well. Going forward, we're going to have to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the upcoming budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have budgeted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For additional lifeguards, which is going to help us. But it may be that we're going to have to just change the way we do things in the evenings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I'm not talking specifically about the the with it y the way we've we've shopped it around and we understand that the correct pronunciation is with it too, although we keep calling it the wee bit, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we and our team, we call it the whip it. So the whip it is one factor. And I think Chief Medina has done a really great job with the innovative ideas of how to control some of the evening activity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what I'm talking about is the increase in activity in the bay. I think we're putting a lot of stress on our lifeguards with the activity in the bay, and I don't know that we really do not have the support that we need for our lifeguards on the bay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's bridge jumping going on. There's a lot of activity with the boat rental companies going on. And Chief Medina has been unbelievably amazing to me as a partner in trying to figure out how to increase the lifeguard presence there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, he can't do it alone. So how does the budget support him?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So at the current time we haven't specifically address that with our budget chief. Medina is doing everything that he can with his current lifeguards that he has. They've increased the patrolling and we're going to continue to do that and look at next year and see how we can increase those numbers even further.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there's nothing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Concrete right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I get that. Chief Espino I get that. I understand that. But perhaps this message is for the city manager. Oil is trading at way over the budgeted $55 a barrel that we have. We've been talking a lot about the Tidelands budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I fully expect that we will be listening to the community on these issues and considering the changes that we've seen in activity along the coastline in the bay. And I can tell you and I so appreciate Chief Espino and the limitations that are placed upon him, and I know he's probably not going to say this in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'way that it needs to be said, but we need more resources to go to our lifeguard division. We have people now, we've got the with it in Alamitos Beach. We've got the women in Alamitos Bay. We've got increased activity in the bay with boat rentals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we absolutely need some more resources to our lifeguards. We just simply cannot continue to do it with the resources that we've had in the past, because I think everyone will agree that COVID was a game changer in terms of recreational activities throughout the city, but especially along the coastline, which is a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think Councilman Ranga would applaud the fact that people are using the coastal amenities more so than ever before, and that's a good thing. And we want to make sure that every resident in the city has access to the coast.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in order for us to be able to accommodate that increased use, we need to have more support for our Marine bureau. So a marine safety division. So, Chief Espino, you don't have to say it because I know it puts you in a difficult position.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'm sharing with the city manager that we absolutely need more resources for our Marine Safety Division in the fire department. And I'm hoping that the city manager can take a look, a look at that and see what we can do to augment those resources in terms of innovative proposals to the chair of the BMC for ways'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that we can augment that budget. So thank you, Chief Espino. But I think know, I think Chief Medina will tell you that he gets probably more calls for service and more community meetings than he probably can share with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman, your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's it's really a lot for one person to handle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So with that, I want to move on to fire. And I want to thank. I mean, I want to move on to police. And I want to thank Councilwoman. Your time is Chief. You are?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman? Yes. Your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wow. Okay. I'll recuse. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Alston.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Thank you so much. I want to just say thank you to all three departments who gave presentations today. I'll just try to, you know, highlight a couple of things that I've heard and a few questions. But if you can get everything in within 5 minutes, if not all with you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll go and order. Start with the fire department. This fire department is top notch. Thank you all for your great work, Chief, and your department. There are a few things that I wanted to just. Just get some clarification on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You requested a position for do the administrative investigations, the love for you to follow up on that, explaining more about the functionality of the position and why of it in terms of administrative investigations, what type of investigations will they be doing administratively?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Internal or external? Just curious about that and then the related the issue of diversity and thinking in a full time position. I think obviously we want more diversity in our fire department and what our same in every department, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would love to know the results of the diversity recruitment over the past couple of years since we've had this position in place. So will be, if you can put forth a memo to the council to show how our diversity is improved for this period of time, that would be greatly appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'll let you respond to the administrative investigation question about that position.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Councilmember, if I can ask a clarifying question, was that specific on fire or other departments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was a fire. That was a fire position in the fire presentation. I was writing notes for. Understood. Got it. Councilman Austin to ask for an administrative investigator or an administrative position to do administrative investigations. Yes. Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Specifically right now, our admin officer is conducting all of the administrative investigations. Quite a lot of paperwork, quite a lot of bandwidth is needed for that. So we looked at the fact that we have investigations that are both internal and external.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We found it to be very, very important for our department that we were able to to get through these, expedite, getting through the investigations, do a good job with the investigation. So we asked for an additional position to help out with the investigation process and also to help out with the PR process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've, as I stated, were receiving 1400 praise per year. And so the only way that we're covering those periods now is with overtime throughout our department, with other civilian staff. And so now having a dedicated administrative assignment for that person, that's going to help us out quite a bit down the road.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With your other question. Thank you for that clarification. And also, I had questions at the end, and you may not have to respond to that tonight, but please provide the council with some sort of data or information memo to highlight the diversity achievements in recruiting department over the last couple of years since we've funded this position.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's it. That's all. I'll move on to Penny. I want to just say to Chief, he this your first budget. I want to just salute and say this was an excellent presentation. It was encouraging to hear and I applaud the creative reorganization and thought that you put into the department and we're really addressing and listening to the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'needs of the system today. Much of what we see in this budget and which I'm trying to do with the department, attempting to do with the department, is this is in response to a lot of what you've heard from the community, but also of the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I think that really what we're doing today needs to money in many respects. I believe that models, you know, should change, particularly in government of police department and every department. I mean, if we we can tweak our models to make them more efficient and more responsive to our public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're doing the right thing. So I'm encouraged by what you're attempting to do with this budget proposal. Obviously, there I have some questions. I want to go into some detail at some point, and you can probably do that during the DLC.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it is it is encouraging to see this focus on on better communications of wellness internally and externally, thinking about the community, but also the officers and obviously crime. And you mentioned homelessness. Well, I will put on your you're something to think about and then I'd like to see accomplished in that no chief has been able to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do in my ten years on the city council, and that is to open our Northwest Police station right from work to business station and basically maybe all of the stations to make them more serving to the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can spend all your time is up. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But let me finish my point.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think in doing so, we do go a long way to better engage our community and improve accessibility to our public safety officials. And so I'll get to Parks and Rec. I can't wait to talk to you guys.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I couldn't agree more. Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. What excellent presentations tonight. Having been on the city council for eight years. I know that there are things that come up year after year and changes that we make and some of them are minor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This year I feel like I see major changes in the right direction and I'm really, really, really impressed with the work that you guys are doing. First and foremost, I look through the budget book and I see the policies are at the front like we as a Budget Committee discuss and how important that is for all of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us to be reminded of the policies that we adhere to as a council that we all agreed upon. Next, I really want to applaud fire. There are lots of questions that I've asked year after year related to grants, related to percentages, related to opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I feel like every single one of those questions was answered in your presentation tonight. I think that the community has asked the same questions over and over again, and I think that all of them are answered in advance this year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that that will be a huge success for us. I want to finish by giving a focus on Parks and Rec police great budget. Thank you for all that you've added. I can definitely see your mark on this, Wally, but with Parks and Rec, what a great budget to talk about the real big steps'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that this Council has made related to eliminating the herbicides in our parks, making sure we have water to water our parks, and then the park restroom issue, park restrooms have been something that I have just harped about year after year after year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We come up with creativity. I remember when I was first elected, I had a staff member who now works for Culver City PD, and on Saturday mornings he would do an inventory of what was needed. He would go to Ace Hardware and he would literally buy soap and toilet seats, not 20.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He covers paper actual toilet seats that had been stolen the night before so that our kids who needed to use the bathroom during the day would have something to sit down on. And now for Parks and Rec to take ownership of their parks in a meaningful way is just so great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to echo the comments of Councilman Sara. I know these are truncated meetings, but our community budget meetings are really where additional information and feedback can be provided so that our city staff hear you. Thank you so much to everyone and just what a great budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm so proud of the work you guys are doing and the focus on infrastructure and how we're going to see that develop over the next 12 months budget. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I really appreciate all of the presentations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was just telling.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilman Ringa I really appreciated especially appreciated his comments. You know, I think we as a council have always been really concerned with workers, whether they're health care workers, grocery store workers. And that's always really important to us. But we also need to take care of our own.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, we need as we start these meeting confirms. I just I think that we just need to think about that. This is our city family. And I just feel like even the years when long time ago, when I was a police officer, I always felt like we were one of the most underpaid in the state'",
        "'speaker_10': '. And so I just think that we need to look at that and recognize that we've got some work to do there. I also want to recognize all the speakers that came out tonight. I know there were a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, concerns.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we have some work to do. But I'm committed to listening to building trust and to addressing the issues that are important to so many people. I'm Chief Habash. Thank you for your amazing presentation. And I just want to thank all of our officers for all their hard work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I know it's a tough and demanding job. So thank you. And I under I really just appreciate all the sacrifices that you make and you your families make to protect our city. I also appreciate hearing the department's continues to prioritize building strong relationships with our residents and community and and still addressing crime, homelessness and also our'",
        "'speaker_10': 'employee wellness. That's the important things. Also the fire chief. So there you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you for your presentation as well. I appreciate your work. I know that our response times are really extremely fast, which save lives, and it's great to see that our focus for this year is to continue to improve those response times for all emergencies and minimizing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A fire loss.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I also like reading about your mental health and wellness initiatives. And also, as you know, many conversations that I've had with you personally, I love to see that, you know, you're looking at hiring more police women. And I loved hearing about your the workshop that you'll the female firefighter career workshop.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's all really good stuff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for sharing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That with with everybody publicly. Brant, someone said so many nice things about you. I agree. You're amazing. We're so lucky to have you and our Parks Recreation and Marine Department. And it was also wonderful to hear about all your accomplishments throughout the year from the openings of Lincoln Park to making sure that all of our beaches and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'marine areas are free of trash.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And just maintaining all of our park facilities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a lot of work. You've got a lot under.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're under your umbrella. So I just really appreciate you. And also, I was reading the river debris was removed from the harbor areas and you were targeting 1500 tons and you end up doing 2500 tons. That's really just really incredible work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So appreciate appreciate you. I'm also excited about the about the pilot magnet door program. So I know we've had a lot of issues, especially out at Bixby Park. So just I'm excited about that. And let's see if this can solve some of the the, you know, the issues that we're having out there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'm also looking forward to seeing all the improvements over at Bixby.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Park as well as.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well. So just appreciate all the department heads. Thank you so much. And we're so fortunate to have each and every one of you leading our departments. And and then I do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have I know my time's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'About to be up, but I do have some questions regarding 911 and just some of the issues that were brought up and this remote occur. So maybe in the days ahead, we can just, you know, clarify some of those those those issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great work, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. And just to follow up, we are working on a separate memo on 911 dispatching and is answering some of the questions that we've gotten about the status of that operation and. That should be out fairly shortly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We heard some other input today. Will be sure to address some of those. Make sure the council's got that information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just to clarify, is the dispatch all in the police department or don't we don't we have it in the disaster preparedness department?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, it's actually not in the police department. All dispatch is in disaster preparedness and emergency communications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When are they presenting engineers?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are they.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Scheduled to present.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right now? They are not. But if that's the request of the council, we can talk about that a little bit as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Next is council members and has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to literally echo everybody's comments. I know that everybody has made some fantastic comments here. I want to thank the three percenters, chief, chief and five year female chief who have this. And, of course, Director Denis for their great presentations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's very important that we as as the council, take into consideration all of the hard work that is being put into all of these budgets and also take into consideration all of the comments that were made from our audience as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you, everybody, who came to speak. I very, very much appreciate your comments. I know that. First of all, Chief Basch, I, I'm just so, so very proud of you and all that you have accomplished in this very short time of being our chief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been amazing. I know we've done some incredible work together. It's really great to have a strong partnership with you. And I think that also with Parks and Rec, I'm just so thrilled of all the work that that we've been doing together in trying to upkeep our parks and make them a place where where our community can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'enjoy. And I know there's still a lot of work to be done, obviously, but I'm really, really excited to be working together towards that goal. There's some really, really exciting things coming our way, and I think that that's very, very important as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to make sure that I also. You know, acknowledge the fact that, you know, there are like I think it was Councilwoman Allen that mentioned this, that along with Councilmember Dunga, that we are always, you know, champions for our workers in in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Me personally, you know, hero pay was very, very important to me. But we also got to look inside, you know, in our homes. And it's very important to be able to feel good about what we have in the house and how we, you know, compensate all of our employees who help us make the city run as efficiently'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as possible. And as we all know, this pandemic has hit us hard and especially within our employees. And I just want to reiterate to all of our city employees at all levels that you are a priority to us and that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we can. And I think it's very important that we continue doing that and to continue finding ways to to be able to do that. I think it's very, very important. I also want to say that it's also very important to me that we do see more activities for older adults, not only activities, but programs and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ways to help our seniors. One, because they are a big, big group in our city. And also because it's we're all headed in that direction. So I want to make sure that they also feel supported by us and by this budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, I want to thank all of my council colleagues for all their very, very informative and very wise comments and and suggestions. And I absolutely support all of all of what has been said. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bank? Very much so. A lot of great feedback there. I wanted to go to police now. The five. Was it am I correct that the slide that you put up, Chief Bush said that 5.4% increase in violent crime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Councilwoman? Yes, that's correct. 5.4% increase year to date. That is after starting this year with a 17.4% increase in violent crime in January.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And we're talking about violent crime. How do we define that as that pursuant to what qualifies as a strike offense?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, Councilwoman, it is from the federal UCR data. Part one Crime and violent crime is categorized based on those guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Do you think you can send me an email with those guidelines and we'll make those available for our constituents because we get asked that question a lot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. You talked a little bit about recruitment. I will say I'm in the law enforcement industry, so I talk with police departments all the time. And I know that recruitment is an issue statewide, probably nationally. But I will say it's a little bit more of an issue in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I talk with police officers from other areas, I asked them a lot of times, you know, why don't they apply to Long Beach? And what I hear repeatedly is that, you know, we're not paying competitive salaries for police officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're just we're not in terms of what what is being paid in the region and. You know, the level of support for police officers fluctuates depending on politics and things like that. So they don't feel like there's a consistent set of support for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's really something we need to focus on as a city and, you know, as elected officials, like, do we support our police officers or do we not? Because I think it's important for them to to feel that, because retention and recruitment is a huge issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's a structural issue that we need to think about, not just for this year or next year, but for the years to come. And I think that's something that we just need to have on our frame of mind in terms of how do we recruit the best and the brightest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can talk all day long and have a lot of rhetoric about what that means, but what does that mean in terms of who were attracting to actually the fire chief? I love the creation of the new bureau.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just want to take a moment. All politics aside, I think everyone here knows that the city budget that was prepared by the city manager that was submitted to the mayor's office that no council member was privy to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Officially on on July the first involved your recommendations. For this community policing proposal and your recommendations for the bike patrol officers that you referred to as the stop program. That was your idea. And I think it's really, really important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't have to comment on it. But for us to acknowledge that on July the first, when this budget was presented to the mayor's office with limited accessibility. Your proposal for community policing and bike officers was the proposal that made it into that budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is your proposal, and I want to thank you, Chief, for listening to the community and working hard to make sure that your proposal made it into the budget. Those of us watching know that this was your idea and we're really grateful for it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to talk to you a little bit about the professional development section that you're creating. Can you talk a little bit about how the ABLE program, which is something that came forth to the Public Safety Committee when I was chair of the Public Safety Committee, which focuses on bystander liability, fits into that program, and how programs'",
        "'speaker_2': 'like bystander viability are going to help with some of the public trust issues and culture change issues that we've been talking about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. The ABLE program is that that grant opportunity will be coming to council on the sixth. But we've already started our programing for able within the department. ABLES ran out of our training division, so that's under a separate bureau where Internal Affairs now the Professional Standards Division will investigate misconduct but also look into body worn'",
        "'speaker_9': 'camera early intervention programs and find ways to address behavioral issues that can ensure employee success and growth we're able is separate from that, but all connected on on demonstrating our commitment and investment in our employees in this department, in this community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So able is still moving forward and that's going to be a department wide operation, a department wide roll out for all of our employees, where the conversion of the Internal Affairs Division is more specific to that, and adding another layer of what we do within that division to ensure our employees can be successful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's wonderful. And I think anyone who's watching tonight, if you just Google the terms by standards ship liability, you'll find that that is an incredible resource. There's a ton of white papers on it in terms of police reform, and I'm so grateful that our police department's participating in that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to ask you a little bit about cameras. We have cameras all over the city. What is the plan to get those cameras tied into the police department? I get this question all the time. Do we have any funding for that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. The camera system in our city is under the Department of Technology and Innovation, so that's under a separate department director. However, the police department does have access to security footage, and we do use that, as I've spoken about that before, for the investigation of crimes and developing investigative leads and that type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the city camera structure is run out of the Department of Technology and Innovation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. We'll save those questions for them. And then the other thing I just wanted to put on screen and price love all the innovative programing that we're doing. I like the allocation of new staff as I see it in the proposed budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But one thing, Chief, that we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a moment is your time is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Up. No matter what district residents live in, they want to make sure that they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Response times. And that's the one thing I think probably me and all of my council members, all my council colleagues can speak to unilaterally is that residents can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Always price your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Making sure that when they call the police, there's someone that's going to respond. And I think that's really important. And I know if you can just make sure that you're focused on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price, your time is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Up get some folks is response time and I think we need to focus on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. So I have a question probably for I think is probably for Tom. Can you speak specifically about turnover, cost and recruitment versus retention spending? I just want to make sure that we're looking at flexible ways to keep valuable employees and avoid having to replace them at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, even greater cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So it certainly is a challenging time right now to both hire a new staff and and keep our existing staff. People have a lot of options out there. It's a very low unemployment rate. And so people are able to move around and and move from job to job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We see that. We love to keep our city employees here as much as we can. Part of our strategy and programs is we do have a lot of promotion activities right now as we do have open positions. We are looking to promote our city employees, but we're also looking to bring on additional city employees to keep hiring'",
        "'speaker_7': 'going and make sure that those who are here have some support and aren't always having to do overtime shifts. We heard clearly from our employees, you know, I think you've heard this from me several times. We have a lot going on in our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We do care very much about our workforce and try to manage their workload because they are being asked to do a lot of extra time, extra work. One thing that we did last year is we created our new performance incentive that would never existed before for anyone that was not in the management ranks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that's available to all employees. And we've been using a fair amount of that to acknowledge amazing work. What I get feedback from employees a lot is not just on the dollar amount, but it's just the recognition.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We sign a certificate. Everyone who gets one of those gets a certificate from the city manager. And it really does help, I think, a little bit with morale. In terms of retention, we do have in our contracts, we've been trying to structure these as long term contracts so that there are projected increases and those are coming.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We mentioned some of those and then of course, we did do equity adjustments in our AM contracts and others for not just every position across the board, but those where we were having some specific issues and we can go a little bit further into that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But yeah, one of the other things we're doing is we are investing in this budget, in civil service and in H.R. we have a number of efforts going on right now to try to streamline our hiring processes and also to bring more resources to civil service so that they can do, you know, open up our our our'",
        "'speaker_7': 'list faster and higher, faster, so that we can help support employees by bringing people in to make sure they're not having to do other jobs for those that are vacant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Awesome. Thank you, Mr. Murdoch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Looking at the police budget so it looks like it's not much of a change. Here we are. So is it already what we're talking about, additional officers like and the bike officers, is that already planned in this budget currently?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So the budget proposal includes 20 new officers, 16 bike officers and four quality of life officers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. My zoom had a quick blip. So if another council member stated this already. I just want to take a quick moment to acknowledge our dispatchers. I heard staff come to the podium tonight to discuss the demand on our dispatchers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And dispatch is a very, very straining occupation. And I would like to see us look towards better supporting our dispatchers. I would love to see. Obviously, pay is a component, but pay is a part of a negotiated process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are still other things that agencies have done for their dispatchers that have been helpful, including refurbishing restroom rest areas because of the stress and the quality of their break times that is necessary. There's lots of other things we can do, and I'd really love to see an investment in that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. No more comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I'll just follow up with my comments. I did appreciate the presentation by Parks Recreation Marine. Again, one of our asset departments that's public facing that. It's always engaging for a community. I think most people experience our parks have a positive experience and that's positive for the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Much of the public comment and I did appreciate hearing from our city employees because of week after week after week. There's a common theme not only in our city but for us in our society, and that's workforce challenges of recruitment and retention is a it's a serious it's an issue that we have to grapple with as a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city council, not just with public safety and police and fire, but what our employment ranks in the city. And so I'd like to see us obviously give a lot more attention to that, because obviously we want to ensure that all of our city employees are coming to work and feeling dignified and respected for the work that they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do. I'm really interested also as well, remember with the dispatch emergency dispatch operators of 12, 18 hour shifts. That's really happening. And I've talked to the director who's shared with me the challenges that he's having with with hiring and retaining employees and that as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think we need to take a stronger look at that. But also, I'd like to see us in all positions, you know, look at internal career ladders in recruiting internally, filling positions internally. People should not have to be feel like they're stuck in the role that they're there in forever, particularly in a city like Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that has so many options for you to learn as well as as an employee. Right. And so we should be when you talk about diversity in hiring. Yeah, we want to know what it looks like, but we also want to know that we I'd like to know that we're looking at our candidates internally and promoting people within'",
        "'speaker_6': 'team to maintain a culture of of of excellence. So those are my comments. I look forward to obviously continuing the conversations around, you know, the X's and O's and the dollars and cents of the budget. But we also need to promote a solid workplace culture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we're moving in the right direction, but we need to look within to build people up as well. X.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council member Super.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Great presentations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By Chief Steven and Espinal and Director Denis and also great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Presentations by our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dispatchers. Fantastic job tonight. And I'll just say here, I would like to see a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By Reggie Harrison as part.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the budget process or at least bring us a wish list, because I'd like to see this fixed as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I just have everything's been covered, I think. But I just also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wanted to thank Chief Espino particular for this statistics that he brought forth. These are things that I knew anecdotally. I'm not sure what term he used on on point. They call them vegetation fires. But I know over the weekend we had.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The 405 freeway shut down at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lakewood Boulevard due to a vegetation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fire. And then I think about 21 hours later, there was a flare up of the same spot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two weeks prior.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We had a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vegetation fire.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Adjacent to the nature center that shut down the nature center for a day. So the stat I heard, Chief, was.'",
        "'speaker_6': '381 arson.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'You went from around.'",
        "'speaker_9': '200 to over 630 and that in that range of more than 3% increase. So what I would like to suggest is that we need some type of effort here. And it might.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Some type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of fire prevention effort, I don't know what exactly it is, but somehow we're taking a look at this issue because if we don't, I don't see it improving. And what we can do in terms of prevention would be something I'd like to look at.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'No, thank you, Mr. Mayor. I recused because I think I'm perfect. I was. I was in the middle of talking when I think my mic was turned off, so I just recused. So. Yes, thank you. So I just have a couple more questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So going back to police. I know police doesn't oversee dispatch, but when people want to call for police response, they call dispatch. And sometimes they don't know that our internal structure makes dispatch a different department than police. And so a lot of times, if they don't get a good response from dispatch, they attribute it to police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And our dispatchers are under tremendous stress. I cannot even imagine how difficult and challenging their work is. So I agree with Councilman Super not anything we can do to be further educated on what we are doing to support them and give them the tools that they need to succeed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We get so many calls from residents and emails from residents saying that they were dissatisfied with dispatch. And sometimes I find myself getting very defensive on behalf of our dispatchers again, because of my line of work on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know the stress that our dispatchers have and they're getting faced with a lot of questions that are beyond just general police or fire response. And so making sure that they have the right training and they have the resources so that it doesn't fall on their shoulders entirely is critical.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so anything that we can do to support our dispatchers, I'm more than happy to do. They deserve our full support and beyond, frankly, because they they are the first line of defense. When residents call for help for 90% of the calls to the city, their touch point is dispatch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We cannot forget that their touch point is not the council office or the city manager's office or any of our departments other than dispatch. 99% of the calls from residents throughout the city that Touch City Hall are through dispatch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we need to make sure we support our dispatchers. So I want to transition over to PR and fantastic presentation. Brant, I know that whoops. After dark last night you and I were talking and I did not realize this is your third budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You came in during COVID years and so it just flew by. But you did an excellent job on that presentation and I know you're working really hard. There's a couple of things I wanted you to expand on, but first I wanted to say our bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know you know, Mr. Janice, that I did my own personal audit of the bathrooms and I had myself and staff point to different bathrooms and looking at their condition. And we really need to make sure our bathrooms are clean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, they just that has to be a focus for our city because taxpayers aren't feeling like they can use the restrooms when they go to the park or with their children or by themselves, and they feel like the bathrooms are not accessible to them, then we're really rendering those who use those public facilities useless to residents'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and we want to make sure that we don't do that. Residents should be able to use the restroom. You go to the park. I know this is a mom of two kids. You go to the park for an hour with your kid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The chances are either you or your child is going to need to use the restroom. And if the restroom is is not in a condition, you're not going to use that. And I think that's one of the core services that the city has to provide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm really grateful for our investment in bathrooms. But can you, Mr. Dennis, talk a little bit about the Rancho budgets for for both Rancho La Cerritos and Rancho Los Alamitos? They are in the budget. And I would like you to talk about them specifically, and I would like you to also touch on Pickleball.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you could talk about those two things, and I think I will be done with questions after that. Mr. Mayor, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Price. So I do want to make a comment regarding restrooms. So I'm very optimistic and fully committed to this new initiative with the Park Safety Ambassadors. I think our park maintenance team has worked very thoughtfully to craft together second shift and have all the resources that from the get go, we'll have trained'",
        "'speaker_9': 'team members out there really doing the best job to secure our restrooms overnight and also maintain them because bottom line is we want them to be safe, clean and welcoming. So I think your comment about young families in particular nature will call and certainly we want our restrooms to be available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the ranchos in the five year infrastructure plan, as I met with both the executive directors and their boards, they are identified as a top priority and for obvious reasons, because of the beauty of their historic structures, a fire detection and suppressant system.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And they've worked with actually the same internationally acclaimed engineer for those systems that are very sensitive to the for the Rancho, the Adobe walls and some of the historic attributes where you want to have a system that's effective but not that obvious.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they have gotten to about 100% final design level, and we had recommended allocating $600,000 for each of the ranchos. And I think that was a. Very important high priority improvement for both of those great facilities. Pickleball I know we have a TFR for the citywide pickleball master plan summary that's going to be distributed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know over the past week or so we've made some really great are we call although we call them low hanging fruit improvements but we introduced for new dual use or dual straight courts out at Marina Vista Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've gotten really great accolades from the Pickleball community there, and we're also moving forward with some improvements at Somerset Park and returning some attention back to Bayshore and College Estates is a little bit more challenging, but we're trying to be thoughtful to the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the growing interest in Pickleball citywide, I think, has been very surprising and it's also very significant. So in the five year infrastructure plan, you'll notice that there were dedicated pickleball courts proposed for Veterans Park to Forest Park and also recreation park adjacent to the Billie Jean King Tennis Center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're thankful for that. And I also always like to give a shout out to our Long Beach Pickleball Advisory Group. They're self-identified ambassadors that have a great passion for what I call their nucleus groups that are scattered all over the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now we've got a new group that's formed up at Halton Park and also, you know, good news while we were at Hoops After Dark, the Salvation Army, it's a new facility or gym at Long Beach Boulevard in spring.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Last night, two Saturdays ago, they actually added pickleball striping to their basketball courts. So they're anxious to work with us to have a pilot, three months league to see if there's enough interest in that part of the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that's the best update I can provide on my favorite sport. Now talk about and I do like basketball too, but but pickleball is important to a growing number of people. Do you have any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Thank you so much. And thank you for your show, Mr. Mayor.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And as a result of that adoption, the City Council actually funded in the FSA 21 budget, this independent assessment. So staff then proceeded to go through an RFP process and we selected police change integration as the firm to actually conduct this study.'",

They also actually went and presented before the charter amendment or I'm sorry, the PCC itself as a result of that in February of 2022, earlier this year, they did a very detailed report to this to the city council, pretty much outlining what they looked at in the study'",
        "'speaker_10': '. They they surveyed the models that they were considering for the city's consideration, given the issues here in this community. And as a result of that presentation of the various models and their recommendations, City Council in February directed staff to go ahead and initiate that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Charter amendment process. And those two initial steps in that process involved a starting the meeting confer process, which staff did and successfully completed the Phase one meeting confer. The second part of that process was to have the city attorney prepare draft language for the charter amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those two steps were done in February. It was started in February and then in June, once the charter amendment process started this, the charter amendment body can conduct at two public hearings. And both of those were both in both of those hearings that the item was continued to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is the third and final public hearing for the charter amendment process. And we are hoping that the result here is that the city council would refer this item to the November ballot. So I'd like to talk a little bit about what oversight of law enforcement is, what civilian oversight is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So in the police report, there was a pretty good definition of what a police oversight actually is. And it's essentially when one or more individuals outside of the sworn police chain of command whose work specifically focuses on holding that department, its officers and its employees are accountable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now, any police oversight really is is critical, but they have several, several attributes. If you could go back to that former slide for a second. I just want to touch on those really briefly. There are seven attributes that any really effective model needs to consider.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number one is independence. And that is something that means that it's independent and it doesn't report to a line department in the city department, but rather an independent entity. It also looks at how much information and access to personnel in the department that the the oversight body has.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's really critical to them being effective and doing the work that they need to do in terms of investigations, review or monitoring or whatever their role is. Transparency and transparency, meaning that the operations and the work of that oversight body are made available to the public freely and without any constraint.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also that there's a reporting component to the to the model. The other one is adequate funding. That is something that has been considered and was recommended in the police report community engagement. It's critical that the community input be a key part of any oversight process, as well as the legitimacy of the actual oversight body.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And lastly, there ideally, there should be some kind of evaluation of the oversight body and the oversight process periodically. Okay. So the next thing I'd like to talk about is where police spent a lot of time, in addition to getting feedback from the public, they spent a lot of time looking at essentially three core models that exist'",
        "'speaker_10': 'nationwide for how police oversight is handled. The first of those is a review model, and the name in the title really suggests what their primary focus is. And that review model, the the oversight body, essentially focuses on reviewing the investigations that were independently done by the by the internal affairs within the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that is one model, a review model. The second model is the auditor monitor model. And this model, it functions specifically to look at systemic operational policies, training and operations within a police department. And there it looks at those and makes recommendations for improvement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's the focus of the audit or monitor model. The third model is investigatory models. And those, as it's the name suggests, you have civilian professionals that are actually doing investigation of complete complaints against the police department. So those are fundamentally the three models where you could focus.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now, the fourth model is a hybrid, which means that you could pick and choose depending upon your community's needs, its objectives. You can pick and choose kind of these pieces of those three models and put together. So what you see on the right here is a really high level summary of what our current PCC model is, because'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it is an investigation model. Essentially, our PCC investigates civilian complaints. Those are external complaints against the police department from the public. The L b our police department, internal affairs investigates those complaints, and then they take the results of those complaints, go to the PCC and they make a finding or a determination on the complaint and they make'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a recommendation to the city manager. And the fourth and the fourth step of that process is for the city manager to make a finding on the complaint. And that's a determination as to whether or not the complaint was sustained overturn or if the officer was exonerated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So what I'd like to talk about at a very high level, and then I'll go into it and on a little bit more detail, just because there is some complexity associated with it is the proposed model. What the police report showed is that what they recommended to this city, based upon the feedback that they heard from the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'public, a review of the operation of the current CC KPCC model. They recommended that the auditor model, auditor monitor term model, but a hybrid, meaning that they wanted the focus to be on audit. Systematic review of policies, training and operations within the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But to support that, the hybrid comes in because they also recommended having an independent police oversight commission and the two of those bodies would work together systematically to address the issues and concerns that that arise in terms of police complaints in our community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm going to give you a high level overview of that. Again, systematic review of internal investigations. And in this case, it would be both external community external complaints that came about from community complaints, but also internal complaints in the police department that arise within the organization.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It also specifies that the director would have the authority to conduct investigations and a very limited set of circumstances. That's when there is great bodily injury resulting from a complaint. In that case, they would actually have the authority, the authority to investigate the complaint or review the the complaint.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll go into a little bit more detail on that. But the other case that was really important that they have the authority is to investigate complaints against the police command staff. And again, another key component of this, this model is that the police oversight director would have access to all of the police department records, all of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'their reports. They would also have access to to personnel as witnesses, to any complaint incidents. And again, I talked about the critical component of this model being the commission, which provides the opportunity for ongoing, ongoing public feedback. So that you're hearing from the community at all times in the process about issues or concerns that that that the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'public may have about police procedures or policies. And lastly, this model includes recommendations, specifically given their independence directly to city council. Okay. So what you see in this light is just a it's a much broader comparison of the different types of models.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I talked about the investigation focused model earlier, and this just gives you a little bit of comparison about these models and how they're how they are represented throughout the nation. In terms of the investigation focus models, there's about 18% of the about 157 police oversight organization or activities throughout the nation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'About 29 of those are investigation focused. And one of the the primary purpose, as I mentioned earlier, is that this model, they really focus on actually having the civilian commission do the investigations. Now, a strength of that model is that it can potentially reduce some of the perceived bias in how complaints are handled, but it also may'",
        "'speaker_10': 'increase community trust in the investigation if they feel that it's completely independent. But of course, a weakness of this process and the investigation model is that it's often procedurally quite complex and it's also pretty resource intensive. And there's also some level of community frustration in this model when broad or systemic change doesn't occur as a result of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the focus strictly on only investigating complaints that arise in the community. The next model I talked about earlier is the review focused. That's the one, again, where the Oversight Commission is focused on reviewing complaints that occur within the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They don't undertake the investigation, but they review the investigation after it's been completed by the fire department. Now, this right now or currently this is the most popular or the most most communities have this oversight model, about 61% of all of the ones across the nation are this model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is an older model, but right now it's still the most numerous around the country. It really does focus, as it says here on review of completed investigations, but it does have some strengths because of the civilian input into the complaint and the investigation process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is there it increases public trust in the investigation process. But the potential weaknesses of the review focused model is that it has limited authority because the authority is focused on investigations or review of investigations rather than a systemic review of all of the policies and procedures.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The focus, again, being on complaints. So let's go to the third model, which is the auditor monitoring model. Currently, only about 20% nationwide have this model. However, this is probably the most the most the newest model that in the world of police oversight, it's the newest and it's the most modern.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And increasingly as as new oversight models come online and communities. This is the model that is is is becoming most popular. And there are some reasons for that. Its primary purpose is to look really broadly and examine systems in a systematic way or a systemic way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Broad patterns in police discipline, a review of police policies, training and operations. And that's one of the reasons that it's used more recently in the modern police oversight models. Some of the strengths of this model is that it gives more robust public reporting because of the systemic approach to looking at policies, procedures and operations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You get a much better picture of the operations, and it's actually more it's more effective ultimately in promoting long term change within the police department. And some of the weaknesses is that the community may be skeptical of that systemic approach, and it does require a staff with significant expertize.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So let's talk in a little bit more detail about kind of what we found when we look at benchmarking our community against other communities, particularly those here in California and in similarly sized cities. So to get that information, we went there is a National Association of Civilian Oversight and they they have a rich database of different models'",
        "'speaker_10': 'within different communities. So the police study looked at 26 different communities here in California, not including our RC PCC here in Long Beach. And what we did in comparing ourselves to other similarly sized cities, we looked at the city of Anaheim and Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They have the auditor monitor model and it's a hybrid because they also have a commission, a police oversight commission. We found the same thing in the city of Fresno and the city of Oakland. Again, all three of these had a hybrid auditor model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'More auditor model. That's a mouthful. Auditor monitor with a commission. And in Riverside, they had the city had a review model. And lastly, in the city of Sacramento, they likewise had a hybrid model that had the auditor monitor again, the auditor monitor being the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'More systemic review of policies, operations and procedures along with the Commission. Okay. So in looking at police oversight, in terms of how you would implement in the city, there are some really important factors to keep in mind. When you start thinking about how you implement or how what model you use, it's really is critical that you realize'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that civilian oversight of police, it is really it's not a policy panacea. It won't address all of the problems of police misconduct or or organizational and operational changes. But it is one really significant piece of that puzzle. So it's important that we keep that in mind that this this that any model that we choose will will need'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to be practice along with other really important tools. There's also no perfect model. I think each city has to look at its objectives and what it wants to accomplish and what the issues are in their community and design a model that really is customized to their needs as much as possible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And lastly, it's so important that oversight programs be grounded in those attributes I talked about earlier. But the really important components are making sure that the model is is is collaboration, and that's collaboration between the oversight body or the oversight director.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the commission is in the city's police department. And it's also critical. That there be a high level of transparency. Okay. So I will talk a little bit in more detail about the oversight model that is proposed. That is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Earlier, I talked about the auditor monitor model. It's a hybrid because what is being proposed is a clearly and a very significantly independent model. Our current model is is underneath the city manager. This model would not be underneath a city department, but it would be independent and report directly to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the two components of the hybrid model are the the director of police oversight. This person is hired and fired by the city council. Currently under a model. Now we don't have a director. It is. The KPCC is managed by a manager within the city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This director would report directly to the city council. He would have direct access to the police department, records, data and personnel and witnesses, including police personnel. And currently, under our current model, there's limited KPCC access to police data.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As I said earlier, a very critical component is that they would look at systematic issues, look at patterns, data and trends and deficiencies within operations, policy and training. And right now, there is no authority of the current model to look in a systemic way at police operations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the second component is the Police Oversight Commission that would be appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council. They have their role would be to solicit or to get input from the community on areas of issues are concerned and they would provide feedback directly to the director regarding priorities for what areas need to be looked'",
        "'speaker_10': 'at based upon the feedback they get from the public. And they would also review the annual reports that the director would be required to provide to the City Council. So why did why did the art consultant recommend the auditor monitor model?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We think that the basis for that recommendation is that this model gives us the best change, opportunity for systematic change within the organization because of the systemic approach to looking at the organization and the and a high level of community input and feedback and collaboration with the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we we also saw that during that very extensive public hearing process, the community asked for independence. They wanted an independent body. They wanted more transparency and the need for oversight of internal affairs, as well as getting better a higher level of education about C.P.S. in the community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So again, I talked about some of these and I will I will go through these really quickly. Systemic issues addressed by the director. That does not occur now because the focus in the current model is on investigations rather than looking at systemic operations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There would be a timeline for when a recommendation is made by the director and a report to the City Council. This model includes a timeline for the police department to review the recommendation and respond and to ask for more time if they need it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd also like to just highlight that they can investigate major uses of force that result in great bodily injury upon the request of the city manager. That's a new authority that they do currently do not have. They also have the right to be on the scene of a critical incident, a critical incident being a a major use'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of force, a police shooting or something of that nature. They get to review all the complaints to ensure that all of the allegations included in the complaint are are appropriate. And they also are required to investigate specific types of incidents.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I mentioned earlier, if there is a complaint against the police chief or the command staff, it's appropriate that there be an independent investigation of that by the director. And lastly, provide an annual report to the City Council on their findings once they do the systemic reviews.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we feel that this model is a strengthened version of police oversight. I listed some of the bullets here that talk about what that role is. They get to review the commission itself. They get to review and provide feedback to the director, and they also play a role in hiring the director.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So they have a very iterative process, working directly with the commissioner in terms of getting public feedback and then making recommendations to the director. Okay. Next. This I to. Here's how just in a really quick summary, how the director works with the Police Oversight Commission.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's essentially a feedback loop where the commission meets monthly and they get feedback from the community, they provide that feedback to the director. And I just give some examples of how that that could work. If there is a particular issue in the community that has occurred repeatedly based upon feedback, they can make a recommendation to the and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to the director to investigate that particular area and prepare a report and recommendation to counsel. So there. The next one is I talked earlier about the systematic reviews or the systemic reviews. This involves the the director looking at operations, policies, procedures and training.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And again, an example there could be if there's a number of calls for service in one particular area, they could ask the police department to look at the criteria for determining those calls for service and provide a report and a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Next slide. Again, I talked earlier about the comparison of those models, and I'll just focus here on the powers and duties, because I've talked about some of the other ones, both the PCC right now and the Internal Affairs Conduct investigations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We feel that that's redundant. So it's more efficient to go to a model where only the I.A., the Internal Affairs, is conducting investigation, but the director would have the authority to review those investigations that are completed. Next slide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Currently the P.C.C. Does have subpoena powers. However, under our current model, they rarely use that authority. But with a new oversight director, there would be no need for the subpoena power because the charter amendment would allow access to all of the police department records, to police personnel, to witnesses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They would allow them to be on the scene of a critical incident so they could observe it and make recommendations based upon their observations. And again, I talked about the community engagement. The proposal now bakes in that community input and engagement into the process, and that doesn't exist in the current model we have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So the director, they would have the authority in a use of force incident that results in great bodily injury. Here's a really quick rundown of what they get to do. They get to respond to the scene to observe how the investigation is being conducted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They get to review the complaint itself before it is investigated to ensure that the allegations are included. They get to audit the case to ensure thoroughness, timeliness and quality. And based upon the findings of the investigation, they can present recommendations to the police, to the to the city, the city council as a result of their investigation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Next slide. In the case of which which doesn't result in great bodily injury, say it's a police involved shooting, but it doesn't result in great bodily injury. They have the same authority there in terms of being on the scene, relying on their own observations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They can actually brief the they can request a briefing of the incident to the to the police commission or the oversight commission. And the director can actually review the investigation again for thoroughness, timeliness and quality. And if an officer involved shooting occurs, the director has the authority to investigate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If the city manager requests it. Again, the very specific role that the director is required to conduct the investigation is within is a case where there is a complaint against the police chief or any member of the command staff.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's where the independence is, is actually required and mandated as a part of this this model. And again, they will report those findings to the city council, and they will have access to all department records and data in order to complete that investigation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So I just wanted to reiterate that as a part of the City Council's initial recommendation to move forward with this charter amendment, they did give staff the authority to look at the current PCC operation and to start implementing improvements in that current process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And those are in the areas of transparency, making sure that the results of the operation are more available to the public. They ask us to look at training for both the commission and for the staff, and also to look at operations for greater efficiency in the current CPC model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So this is just a recap. There were substantial opportunities for public engagement, and I mentioned some of those earlier, and that also includes the two public hearings we've had so far to date, as well as tonight's public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I will just highlight that any change in the proposed charter amendment and language that's already been published and circulate it would require a meeting confer with the affected labor organizations. And if that were to occur as a result of tonight's feedback, it would fundamentally defer the the proposed amendment to the to the 2024 election cycle because'",
        "'speaker_10': 'there were just not be physically time to complete the meet and confer and still make the ballot. So the staff recommendation in closing is that we ask the recommend that the city council refer the matter to be placed on the on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We think that the auditor monitor hybrid model is a superior, stronger and more modern model than the one we currently have. It's responsive to the public feedback that we heard during the outreach process, and we think that it provides the greatest potential for systemic change and reform based upon a high level of collaboration between the the Oversight'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Commission, the director and the police department. That concludes that presentation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Do have a motion by Councilmember Austin and Councilman Sara Johnson are awesome. Do you want to go to the public or you want me to comment first?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to go public first.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So, Madam Clerk, will you do the public comment, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 and person, please line up at the podium in Zoom. Please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello again. I am very, very encouraged by this. I am very excited to hear something about this. I'm a strong advocate of we, the people. The people are the actual government up here. You folks, with all due respect, you're the representatives and the public servants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when the people are empowered to have oversight, I'm extremely, extremely encouraged. And I appreciate this this being brought forth. I'm reading here. Forgive me. I am encouraged by the fact that it's independent. It's independent and as transparent as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I call it a win. And when I speak transparency, I mean as transparent as possible. Say, when someone goes to court, they are even if just accused and not found guilty, the public knows what's going on with who, where they are in the investigation, what things have gone on rather investigation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in the case. So so transparency as much as possible is very encouraging. I'm not sure how deep it goes. I would like. I would actually like to read for the details. But I want to make sure that there is no absolutely no red tape from the police to state that, hey, there's an investigation going on and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we can't share this information. This has to be, again, as public as possible with no red tape, or they must be compelled legally or face consequences. One or two people behind the whole thing is fantastic. However, again, being that it's public would be would be best.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that way they any sort of steps that they take the public know exactly where they are, who's involved, what steps are taking. So to people is great, but so long as their work is entirely public I believe would be would be best placed to say we should consider maybe termed employment for these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That way they don't become entrenched and and shake hands with folks behind doors, possibly, possibly an elected type of type of position again. So that again. So it could be termed and and avoid entrenchment. No hiding behind a public investigation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse. Excuse me. Writing. I wrote a lot of notes. This. I'll just. I'll just end with this. I guess we can be a model as as the presentation showed, others are doing it. But I think we can be a model to be the perfection of what it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no perfect, but we can be as close as possible to perfection if we need to hold it off a little bit till 2024. I'm not saying we do. If in case I would rather we do it quality before quickly, because something like this is absolutely fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm again, I'm very encouraged. Last quick, quick note. Very, very on this on the side here, just a quick request on decorum. If the council members can maybe shut off their videos when they're eating big mouthfuls with noodles, hanging out of their mouths is very distracting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Just 1/2, sir. Everyone that's going to speak, if you can, please just line up at the podium, please. Is anyone else speaking on this item? I'm going to close the speakers list. Okay. And then is there anyone on?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Did you do the count? Okay. Great. Yes, sir. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Tom Beck. I'm an attorney. And I've done a great deal of litigation with the police department of your city over the years. In fact, I was instrumental in in seeing that the first CPPCC came into existence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my concern then, and it continues to be today is whether or not a complaint by an or an aggrieved citizen reaches a fair conclusion and objective conclusion. The weakness in the current system notwithstanding what you've just heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that although now the proposed oversight lacks the ability to investigate. It also opens the door for investigations at the discretion of the city manager. If it's a GBI, great bodily injury case or shooting or. Yes. By an officer, that that that's a hybrid to me the office that they're either going to have the powers to investigate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'especially those high profile incidents or they're not. And this is where the subpoena power becomes so important, because under the present system, the power exists. And if you've just been told that power is being taken away, if an investigation is being commanded by the city manager into a high profile incident, they shouldn't be confined to the parameters'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the department's investigation into that incident because they may discover, for example, a very simple one, that if they can't subpoena the medical records of the person that was injured, to know the gravity of those injuries, whether they can be called GBI or not, GBI makes a difference.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that, to me, emasculated the power of the investigative oversight body. It's really at the discretion of the city manager to do it. And and the model that's being proposed patterns itself after the war, the way the United States Department of Justice overtakes the the administration of police departments, as it did in L.A., as it's done in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seattle and Ferguson, Missouri, where those persons reported to a federal judge, not to a city manager, and who had the authority to the cloud, so to speak, to do things that the city and its employees, its agency, were unwilling to undertake.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that those are weaknesses you all must consider before you decide to bump this to to the electorate, because the electorate electorate really won't know any of the things we're talking about. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They can expect police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I want to thank you for a very thorough presentation. I do have I am in support of this commission, but I did have a couple concerns. First, I was just wondering how the community will continue to be engaged with this commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that a part of why this commission was created in the first place was to ensure that the community has that direct line of communication with the Commission. And so I'm hoping that that is further clarified to ensure that that still does happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, my other concern is that how this committee is selected. I know it's stating that the city council members and the mayor will be the ones selecting the committee, and there's really no input from the community itself. And I'm wondering if there's a possibility of opening the door that perhaps the community can have influence on selecting those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'committee members or maybe even voting those members into this commission? Because, again, this is about that line of communication with the community. And I'm sorry I may hurt some feelings right now, but as we talk about the criticisms of the city council and the police department, there's really no response to those criticisms, but instead continued praise for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the Long Beach Police Department. So I'm just questioning if they're going to select people on that commission that will truly have oversight over the police department. I know in the presentation it was included that a potential weakness is that you need a staff with significant expertize to have truly true oversight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's again, echoing my concern about who might be selected on this committee. And I think it's important to have people that have expertize in systemic racism and systemic issues within communities. So that's looking at, again, systemic racism, specifically issues of policing, the history of policing, not just in Long Beach, but in the United States as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a whole. So I think that's really important for the commission and even the director specifically. My other concern was that it was mentioned that only the internal affairs would be investigating and that the Commission didn't necessarily have to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, I'm questioning how do we ensure that the Commission will be investigating the issues that are coming forward? And again, I think that's important through that ongoing communication with the community and full transparency, as someone else also stated earlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, I've read the language in the recommendation prior to coming in and it just seemed very vague in terms of how much community input would be in this commission. And I'm hoping I'm hoping that we can really strengthen the language or just at least clarify community input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, I want to emphasize community input on the commission members and the expertize that is needed for those positions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you next week or please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and counsel. And my name is David Clement and I'm a resident of the second district, Cyndie. And I had the honor of serving on the PCC a few years ago and I was chair one year and I was appointed by Mayor Foster, reappointed by Mayor Garcia and then supported by our Councilwoman Susie Price'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Susie and I also served with Sully Sara one on one of the commissions and I Patrick Patrick Weathers over there. He's one of our investigators. In any case, I have always had the greatest respect for our officers, men and women in uniform.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe that the entirety of the CPC felt the same way. We have a great police department. I think the vast majority of our officers are of the highest caliber professionalism and integrity. But my position on this is I don't think that we should of I don't think you should vote on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think it should be passed. I don't think it should go to a to the ballot and for the following reasons. So I ask you to vote no on it. I believe that the proposed changes to the Charter will weaken the PCC, see PCC rather than strengthen the Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that will hurt. I think it's ironic, I think will hurt some of our most vulnerable, vulnerable people, people of color. Because because if we have this person, this person called the oversight director having to be somewhat subservient to our city manager, it seems like that kind of a conflict of interest, and I don't support that'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think that and it's ironic because these people are the same people who vote for the majority of our council members. So so I don't support this this amendment. I think that the CPPCC should be able to interview police officers if there's a complaint directly interview those officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that I think that the current CPPCC should be able to. I think that the fact that the city manager can overturn and review findings of the CPPCC, I think that that should. I think that's a little bit of a conflict of interest as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So please vote no on this amendment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Stephen Downing. I'm a resident of Council District three. This is a pre-paid package. From a so-called consultant who did not compete. But rather got the job through a purchase order and then went through the motions to deliver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we see tonight is a preordained package that works for the way it works for City Hall, but it doesn't work for the people. The proposed charter amendment guts every possibility. The people of this city ever had for true civilian oversight of their police department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we have now in the PCC charter could have been improved, but clearly even that is made to work by eliminating the false barriers that have traditionally been put up to ensure that it did not work. Like interview of officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interview of witness officers obviously posed too great a danger. To City Hall image makers. And so tonight, the curtain will fall on the third act of one more firm performance of Long Beach political theater. This one billed as part of a framework or reconciliation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I fully expect the performance will receive rave reviews from behind the rail. We've all been able to rationalize their praise by pointing to the dishonest polling of 896 potential audience members. Made to believe that the $53,000 reconciliation bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that they read will actually result in a performance that delivers true civilian oversight. Well, those of us who are interested enough to attend the actual performance and all of the rehearsals leading up to it to know what a turkey.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The oversight performance will really be so as a last appeal. All we can ask of those of you who will vote tonight is that you abandon the 63% crutch offered from that poll. Of those falsely led to believe a great performance will be delivered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your time is an individual thought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the quality of the script.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Time is in play. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Relationship.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sir. I'm so sorry, sir. Time is up next. Speaker, please. And votes. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will these over the microphones?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OFFICER So, sir.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You mean that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your time is up? All right, sir. Thank you, sir. Time is up. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would give Mr. Downing most of my time. My name is Richard Lindeman. I was with Julie Shiro on the Ship Commission and my share, but it's been pretty much a fraudulent commission since its inception. You know, it has no real bearing because it didn't matter what we decided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On any case, sometimes the city manager agreed with us. Usually when we said no, sometimes she agreed. A couple of times when we said yes. But it's still up to the city managers. Discretion. And that's where the problem lies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we have something that has been. Recommended here. This should not stand at this point and it should go into actual. Election. And be a real independent. Organization because the ship she she is not. And this derivation of it is not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You'd expect a police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I carelessly here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did appreciate the professional report. I learned a lot from watching that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't have time to really digest it. It wasn't in the staff report, um, information. But my first question would be why would we choose the model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is least.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Likely to have public confidence? And that's on those charts. It said in there that you had to be you had to it was critical to have a high level of transparency with this chosen model. And, you know, Long Beach isn't famous for transparency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But when I read the documents on this, it talked more about confidentiality. So it would be very difficult to get transparency along with confidentiality. Those are two opposing things to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my, my real question is, what is the problem we're solving? I can't figure that out. I mean, I hear it doesn't work, but it sounds like we're throwing out the baby.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With the bathwater.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We haven't gone through and picked out what doesn't work and what can we do to fix it. Right now, we have a citizen commission that has a lot of rights. They can initiate an investigation, hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, documented disposition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those are big responsibilities. All of those authorities have been removed. So it sounds like we thought that was a failed model. And I think we're going to have to take out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The word.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Citizen commission if we go with the choice that's being made here, because this is not a citizen's commission. This is a professional model. You're looking at bringing in a professional.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To do the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Things that you had citizens doing anyway. Anyway, the investigative reports are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Causing the city problems in court. I mean, I, I wonder I keep looking at this and saying, what is the problem we're fixing? Who benefits from it? And I just heard the last speaker say the peel away and city hall benefit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll tell you how I don't feel. We benefit. This is going to cost more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have to hire people to do this. So if if.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We were really.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Getting something better, perhaps that'd be worth it. But I just heard all those other speakers tell you that we're not financing the basics of running the city. I mean, we have a whole department that's working hours and hours of overtime, and we're talking about bringing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In more high level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Executives. That doesn't make sense to me. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They can expect place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Your presentation was very informative and I too learned a lot. But it still leaves me with some questions. And I know that we need to do something. We got to do something quick and fast because we cannot continue down the path that we've been traveling historically with policing and what it brings to the community, especially'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for black and brown communities. There needs to be transparency. There needs to be accountability. And there's none of that. So when we look at an oversight committee, a committee, I do believe that maybe this instilled need to be involved with that as well, as well as having it brought to the attention and maybe put on the ballot'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so that citizens can vote on that to have a say in what's going on or who's chosen for that job position. With that being said, anybody that you've made a mention about having an expert, being expert in that in that field, for somebody to be an expert in the field for this director position, I question what does'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that actually mean? What are they are expert in? And what concerns me is that that now brings in another law enforcement mindset. And again, how do we screen out? Those potential risk. That is still a risk and they're still working hand in hand with police officers again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that being said, clearing those things up, making sure that we do have a community input in that, that's very crucial in there. If we're going to have accountability and trust to build community trust, the only way we're going to do that is if there's transparency and we're actually involved in that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that said, again, making sure that we clear out what are those expertize you're looking for involving the community in that? Yeah. Building up some trust and transparency. We need it all the way around. How do we work together?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't continue down this path. The reality is people are still dying on the streets. And they look like me. Something's got to change. If you want law enforcement to have respect, they must have respect to the first and foremost accountability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How about we get rid of qualified immunity to black lives do matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes another public comment that's here lined up. I think we have a one that's going to be online and control.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Your time begins.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now. I had my hand up for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A previous comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did not have my hand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Up with this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. That concludes public comment. We have a motion by customer Austin customer in Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I thank you all as the mayor and I really want to thank the people who came out and provided public comment and provided input throughout this process to get us to this point of. I would just say that I had the privilege of serving on the Citizen Complaint Commission from 20003 to 27.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I served as chair of the Commission and it certainly is not a perfect commission. And there were a lot of frustrations with the commissioners about, you know, sometimes a lack of power, lack of transparency, lack of authority to really make a difference.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I've learned a lot over the course of my time personally on the city council as well. I just want to give everybody a little bit of background. No. One Citizen Police Complaint Commission was put in place with 30 years ago, 1992.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe the first executive director had a law enforcement background and the second executive director had a law enforcement background and the third executive director had a law enforcement background. And it wasn't until recently, maybe the last ten years or so, that the civilian kind of got the position of the executive director.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But during the course of that period of time, we also saw the staff in that commission significantly reduced. Right. That's what the city council. That's what the city manager. And the effectiveness of that condition was was impacted as a result of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The culture was set up early with the executive directors and the managers of that commission. And I can go into even more detail on that recently, just within the last couple of years. And I'll ask the city attorney, when do we find that that the City PCC had subpoena authority?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe you can help me out with that. Somebody. That's a request.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. This is Don Macintosh. We'd have to look into when exactly that happened and get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Ralston, I believe it was recently. Within the last couple of years. Right. It was actually the CPC does have subpoena authority. And for all these years, they did utilize this, this, this, this authority or this tool that they had.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had because we were told we couldn't ask certain questions and we couldn't get certain information. Well, I think that was a game changer. The opinion from the city attorney's office to give the city c. C. Subpoena authority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm I'm I mean, I like the fact that we've gone through this exercise and looked at other models. And even as I mentioned earlier, every model was meant to be changed. But I think this model can be actually changed and we can achieve this hybrid model that we're looking to achieve through a administrative action.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Through two actions that our city manager already has the tools at his disposal to empower to commission even further the the proposed commission. To me, he values the citizens. Right. It takes the citizen component and assists an oversight component away from the model.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and and there's somebody, I think astutely mentioned it makes it a professional model. Right? It creates another IP manager with with the with the direct accountability to city council. But I mean, where's the citizen involvement? I think that's that's really what's missing here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm troubled. I want to and certainly I really want to make some similar reforms to our city PCC. I've always said that I think there are administrative tools and we can we can do one. One thing that was actually missed missing from tonight's presentation that we received a couple of weeks ago was actually the the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the cost difference of of this is the current model versus what is being proposed is going to be significant. We're going to add several staff members to be able to support this this new auditor. Auditor model, but. The current motto is deficient with stealth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to ask yourself, how much better could this model be if we added a couple of investigators and we added the administrative staff to allow them to at least do their reports on time? I understand our reports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We haven't had a report. What was the last time the city council voted on a key report? Right. They're delayed. They're late because it's a staffing challenge. And I would challenge that to try to challenge me on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This this stuff this model goes from 11 commissioners to seven commissioners with less responsibilities. This model doesn't apply for our commissioners, too, to investigate the small things that really impact people's engagement. It's not just the officer involved shootings and and great bodily injuries and use of force issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's this respect. It's the engagement that people have with police officers. This officer called me in a racial slur. This person, you know, mentioned my sexuality. You know, those are complaints that that the PCC deals with that won't be dealt with under this model at all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I can tell today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so Jasmyne asked, is your time is up?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just there. My time is up. I'll recruit. But I'm having a tough time justifying moving forward with this model and taking it to the voters because I think it needs some work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So I can comment on some of that. I'm assuming that was not set in motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my motion would be to not approve staff to make a recommendation tonight and continue to work on our own civilian oversight model.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So is there a second on that motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, Councilman, give any comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. Just open to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have no one else queued up right now. I have a motion in a second. Anyone else have any comments?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess I'd like to ask a couple of quick questions. Councilmember Austin, I hear a ton of passion in your voice, and I know you have a lot of experience in this and. I guess I would ask what a timeline would be, because I think that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's moving in the right direction. I do agree there are some challenges. I also know that the community. Is looking for change now. And I heard you say that you think within the scope of the city manager's authority, we could make some of those changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What would that timeline look like and how will we involve the community in that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'll just put forward my my recommendations based on what I've heard from them. People want independent commission. What? They want a commission with teeth. Well, the training for commissioners should be done independently about that, right? But the training of four police commissioners and maybe is that professional of auditor or investigator that comes in and provides that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'training improve the communication. The budget allows this commission to communicate with the public. The public gallery improve the public trust. Right. As it stands right now, it doesn't matter if it's a C, P, C, C, existing model or a a new model.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we don't we don't build a communication and. A way to engage the public. We're never going to have the public trust. We're going to have the same problem that we have today. Right. And so that that I don't even see that in this new model.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think we need to staff this insurance, because you see with civilians, investigators and administrative staff, individuals that don't have conflicts necessarily. Those would be just initial.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think one of my initial hesitations as one of the public speakers came forward today and said. Who is selecting these commissioners. And I think that that's a big question. And the integrity of the body. I think that having community input in the selection of the commissioners could be a an important factor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm open to seeing where this motion goes. And also open to letting it go to the voters and them saying that they feel the same way you do. Councilmember Alston So thank you for your passion about this important matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ciro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm. I'm really curious. Why? What is it you know about? Because we have a from 11 commissioners to seven, which will still be part of representative, that there's still going to be city resident commissioners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so the question I wonder I have is how is it are residents still able to make complaints to I.A. as they normally would? So people who have concerns still everyday people about the police would still be able to do that, right?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is correct. There is no change in that process in terms of them being able to go to the police department, because right now, the majority of the complaints that we receive to see PCC come directly through the police department so that process would not change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as far as my understanding, having also served as the chair of the Citizen Police Complaints Commission, I have heard loud and clear from many of my colleagues here about I mean, one of my colleagues who I serve here shared that he feels this is a much more independent process that will allow the that that residents voices'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who made the complaint would be heard even more because it's not going to be going through the concerns. I've heard a lot from my colleagues who served on the commission with the concern about it going through the city manager versus now it's going to be investigated by an independent individual, will be able to look be able to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'review numerous materials that we don't have access to. But they will also this director would also have the ability to report to the commission on his that person's finding as well. Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That is correct. The any report that's prepared by the director would go to the commission on and wrote to the city council. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I felt that there was a thorough process in getting feedback from our consultants and really felt like this is a redesign based on what people have asked for. Obviously, the next steps will be determined by the voters in order for us to determine how the next process will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I like to make a substitute motion and go back to supporting our original item on the agenda right now. Now, second, that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a substitute motion to go back to. I believe the the staff recommendation is that if that's the way to phrase it, to move to the charter amendment, to move to the ballot. There's a second one. Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh, let me keep going on the less councilman knowledgeably comment on the second. Okay. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much. Well, I want to be clear. I support civilian oversight very much. I was very much involved in the process. I'm just not sure that and nothing convinces me that this is going to change or add the public confidence that we're looking to of this deal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would ask the city manager, can you do a comparison in terms of what our existing model is right now and what it what you propose to be? I thought it was $1.4 million and an additional was five staff or civilian oversight versus our current model and 2.5 full time employees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The current model is 2.5 employees. And the the recommendation is for an additional four employees. The net additional cost under this new model is point just shy of 1 million as point nine. 900,000 to add the additional employees and the support for the Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Well, I mean, I think, you know, obviously, you know, we want to make sure that we are a quality city when that's all we can. We're in our budget process right now, and we heard a lot of public comment about employees and workforce challenges.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would just venture to say that we have a lot of other priorities right now that we should be putting additional an additional million dollars toward right now. Or we could bolster the existing PCC with staffing. Right. And get a stronger result out of the existing model that we have today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's that's that's the whole my my and my only that that that's a that that's something that I think is you to taking the strong consideration. You know I understand yes we went through a a great process and doesn't mean that that that at the end of the day, we come in we're walking out with a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'perfect model because this is certainly what is proposed, not a perfect model. And you heard that from staff as well. You heard this. You're going to have the same criticism. There's going to have confusion. You're going to have citizens who are confused with the model and don't know who to put a report to or how to even'",
        "'speaker_6': 'access it. Those are challenges with the existing model that will continue to be the situation if we are all forward with what is recommended recommended today. And I would just just say to you, ultimately, the accountability for civilian oversight rests with this body at city council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. We are the responsible people for this. We we set the priorities. We set the tone for our city. We set the budget. We are the people that are accountable for failures in our systems. If our city manager is oversee PCC and the PCC is not functioning, then that's on us because we hire the city manager and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'he hires the manager for the city CC. I honestly believe that we have the ability to have a strong hybrid model, to build the model that we have with the tools that we have today. And and what we heard earlier from our police department should have been encouraging because there's a there's a culture shift within policing as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'well. So with that, I mean, that's fine. There's been a subsequent blessed motion. You know, we can play this game and go back and forth. I will offer to substitute. Substitute motion. Right. To. To consider to to further study this matter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And and it has to come back to the city council at a later date with three options for civilian oversight that that will help meet our needs of the public trust, accountability and transparency. That's my most.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. There's a substitute motion to substitute. Substitute motion? Is there a second on the substitute? Substitute motion, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's a I believe there was a council on bongos. Did I hear that correctly?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm happy to do it. I thought it was Roberto, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm happy to be the second. I also have a question now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, it was. There was no no one's done the second yet. I heard someone from the video. I thought it was on second. Okay. There's a there's a substitute substitute motion which I think we've heard. Did you have comments come forward, Marco?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do. I'd like to ask the makers of all motions on the floor to consider a friendly amendment that. Immediately, regardless of if this passes the voters or goes to the voters, depending on which motion passes that the city manager is instructed to include the additional staffing effective October one with the passage of the new budget year'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I'm comfortable with both options on the floor, but I do strongly feel that both Councilman Zorro and Councilman Austin, who served on this commission, feel that it is significantly understaffed. While we all agree that there are lots of needs in the city and that are important and we have heard from the community that they would like additional'",
        "'speaker_2': 'oversight. And I think that an immediate way to do that, regardless of which method we choose, is to staff the commission appropriately. So, Councilmember Austin, are you open to that friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that I cannot make a friendly amendment to a motion that is not currently on the floor. But should this motion fail, I ask that any subsequent motion. Consider my friendly. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would just. Just ask. Yes? What would you think is appropriate staffing? Right. Currently we have a manager, maybe an investigator and a kind of admin or half time academy of. I think at least two investigators need to be added to this and a full time admin of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So point from 2.5 to 2 to four or five is to me would be appropriate to have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As chair of Budget Oversight Committee. I. I'm going to yield that to you and say yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. I have Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just a few thoughts on this. And it's been a while since we had a substitute substitute conversation. So I'm actually kind of excited about this. Just real quick, just in terms of process, if this doesn't move forward tonight, it can't happen for the this election.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It has to be reconsidered for future election. Right, 2024. I don't know that I want to pass this discussion on to a future council. I won't be a part of that council. So I would like to, you know, take some action.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will say a few things. One, I appreciate the history that was given to my you know, about how sort of the staffing had changed. And at one point it was law enforcement focused and it was more civilian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I appreciate that. But I think that actually underscores the flaw with the PCC is that any given council or city manager with a different style or leader can have a deep have a significant impact on how effective it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's largely outside of the, you know, one paragraph or so the small, you know, the description within the charter. Most of it is programmatic. And program can be powerful, certainly, but policy is progress. And I think what I like about the hybrid model is that it acknowledges that we live in systems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The police department is a system guided by policies made by people. And times change and standards evolve. But if the charter if your system isn't evolving, it's difficult to make sure that we are always getting better. And I believe that systems should always get better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Looking at a system that evaluates both the ability to go in because it's a hybrid going and review investigations. With citizens, but also to have an auditor who's like keeps a lens on trends and systems. I think that's interesting and I think that is a more modern model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would ask that staff just pull up that slide. That compares the three models because I really I think that was really telling and I hadn't seen that slide before. No. The one that said the positives and the negatives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I said. Okay. So, yeah, so I thought this was good. If you take review focused and auditor focused and you compare the positives, the strengths and weaknesses, I think these are some of the things that people have been asking for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if you look at review focused because we're moving away from investigation focused because there's right now there's two investigations, there's an internal investigation and a citizen investigation. This model allows you under review to review the internal investigation and to audit trends.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So here's what I think is great under potential strengths provides civilians inputs and input into the complaint. Invest into complaint investigations. That's a good thing. May increase public trust in the investigation process. That's a good thing. Then when you look at auditor monitor focused, often more robust public reporting, that's transparency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's something people want to see. That's something I'd like to see. That's a good thing. May be more effective in promoting long term systems change in policing. That's something that's a priority for me, that we continue to have a better police department and a better city in the long term.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I actually like that long term view. I also like the slide that that highlighted that we're looking at best practices across cities that are our size. Fresno, Oakland, Riverside, Sacramento, Anaheim, when we think about policy, is always good to look at other agencies that are similar in size because as they evolve, we should evolve as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and learn from their best practices and improve on it. We should be a leader and help improve those areas as well. I also like this presentation, provide examples on how because that had that wasn't there before you provided examples on how this could be used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you know, before I run out of time, I'm going to ask you to go over those examples again now. Not right now, but I'm gonna make a point, I think often. The discussion when things happened is what happened.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's not enough discussion about why it happened and how we keep it from happening in the future. And that's what's interesting to me about looking at the systems model by including the auditor controller. That's what's interesting to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I know that the PCC is not perfect and I know that it hasn't been funded the way it needs to be funded and that needs to be corrected. I also know there's a transition in place should this be adopted by voters, and we should fund that immediately to make sure that we don't miss a beat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think we have a responsibility to take what's been presented, and I like the timeline that is presented today from reconciliation, all the discussion two years ago to today. We have a responsibility to put this in front of the voters and let the voters decide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I support moving forward with staff recommendations tonight with also adding what Councilmember Mongeau mentioned in terms of let's make some recommendations to improve CPC staffing, staffing today. And that's where I am on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I want to say that the thing that I'm frustrated with is. The. I followed this all along and I know the staff member who was leading this is no longer with the city, but. This is a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you talk about a city as large as the Titanic and you take a step like this, this is a titanic turning decision. And I am just disappointed in the staff that this is happening at the 11th hour because I feel like the items being brought forward have put us as a council in a really tight sort'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of a I hope that the city brings back alternatives that are better, which I know there are some or a accept this and put it towards the voters. And if the voters feel, as some have stated today, that they're frustrated with this, I worry about the additional lack of public trust that can come from putting forward something'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they don't the community doesn't feel heard their needs. I do really appreciate the points brought up by Councilmember Richardson, and I appreciate that the proposal is ambitious and says this may happen or that may happen. But I think what I heard from the community is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's not a system to guarantee it. And I get it. We're all people. And and the system is based on the people within it and that they do the right thing and we select the right people. And I again, that's why I've been torn tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do want to appreciate the staff and the work that they've done so far to get us to where we are and to help us have a option and option. And I would just ask that. We look back at this in two years and say that items like this should be coming before the council with at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'least 120 days of deliberation where all presentations have been brought forward appropriately. With that, I support both the substitute substitute motion and the substitute motion, and I appreciate the staff and all the work they've done. And I think we've learned some good lessons today, and I appreciate the community for coming forward with some really good input and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'feedback. And I applaud Councilmember Austin for trying to make those steps to make the the resolutions and changes that he hears from the community. And I also appreciate Councilwoman Zoro and her pursuit of a solution for the the voters to consider.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Back to basically Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just one thing that I left off on. I didn't actually allow you to finish the question. I asked you to just review one time those examples that you gave, because I thought that was very compelling to help explain to the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What we can do now that we couldn't do before. If you could just do that. That would be helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The three specific different examples. So scenario number one, this is a case where the director it's it's outlining the director's authority when there is a use of force incident that's resulting in great bodily injury. The director can respond to the scene and observe the investigation and how it's being handled.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They do not have the authority to do that now. They can review the complaint before it's investigated to ensure that all of the appropriate allegations surrounding that particular case are included in the investigation. There is no opportunity to do that under the current model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They can audit the case to ensure that the investigation is thorough, that it's done in a timely manner, and that it's done with the highest level of quality. Again, there is no opportunity right now for the PCC to actually audit an investigation and make recommendations based on the findings from the investigation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The director can present the recommendations for the police department. Any thing regarding policy practice or changes, those can come to the City Council under this model. That is not an authority that the see the current C PCC has where any of their recommendations come to the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The director has the authority to investigate the use of force incident when it results in great bodily injury. If it's requested by the city manager, again, that is not that is not a current authority that the PCC has.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that there's example number one, that was one, there was a great bodily injury. Scenario number two, the director has the ability to respond to the scene, to observe the investigation and how it's being handled. They can rely, obviously, on their own observations of the scene when considering the evidence that's being collected and the witnesses being interviewed'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Again, that's not an authority that they have currently. The commission can receive a briefing from the the police department and the director on the specific incident where it's an officer involved shooting so that they can understand how the event will be reviewed and how it will be processed by the department when the department conducts their investigation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The director can review the investigation for thoroughness, timeliness and quality. They can, based on the findings from the investigation when it's completed by the the I.A. and the the their review of the part of the investigation. They can present recommendations for the the department regarding policy or practices.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And again, those recommendations will come directly to the city council for consideration. And lastly, if an officer involved shooting occurs, the Director has the authority to investigate that officer involved shooting if it's requested by the city manager. And just to go back on that one case, if you could go back 1/2 and on this one, the city'",
        "'speaker_10': 'manager's role here is to request that they investigate. They would not be actually conducting the investigation. The the Internal Affairs Department would continue to investigate. That is always their role. But the city manager can request a specific investigation for this type of incident.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Lastly, the third is a case where there is a complaint against the command staff. The director has the authority to investigate a complaint against this, the police chief or the any of the command staff. If he's requested by the city manager, the director would conduct that investigation and provide a report of their findings directly to the city'",
        "'speaker_10': 'council. As I mentioned earlier, just want to point out that in this case, we talked about the communication directly with the commission. Any report that's prepared by the director would come to the commission so that there is a public review of that report when prior to its being forwarded to the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. Lastly, the director has access to all police department records, reports, personnel and witnesses. And again, that is an authority that the the current model does not provide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. May. Go back a councilmember Superman and then come from here. Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So on the slides, Linda Tatum could reiterate there. I think I heard at least on two of the bullet points.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Caveat of if you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Know, asked by the city manager, my understanding was this whole idea was to give the director autonomy in the city manager. So my question is, are we just following some other cities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Model and we've or was.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is there a is there some rationale for why that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Caveat is in there on a couple of bullet points?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The point of including that language in there is to stress that because this is not an investigative model, it really is designed to ensure that in some cases that are of great concern to the community that the city manager has a role or a role in asking to ensure that those incidents of interest to the community, that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'there is a path so that the investigator can then review those. I'm sorry, the director can then review the investigations are conducted by the police in those specific incidents. Again, it's just highlighting and encouraging greater transparency to the community in those incidents because otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe I didn't frame my question. Right, but I'm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Unclear on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city manager has a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Role here. We're hiring a director, paying him a lot of money. Why does the director have that authority.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Without without.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Approval from the city manager?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I see. And I understand your question again. I think the interest there was because this is not an investigative model. The idea is to try to to to not have this body or this director be consumed with investigations, because their primary role is to look at the whole process policies, procedures and operations much more systemically and to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'minimize the incidents in which they would need to actually go directly into reviewing a particular case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is well, this is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Time. I just it from comment that what I've heard generally over the years is that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city manager did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not act when there was an expectation that the city manager acts. I see the flaw here that we would be back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To square one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Possibly, but we spent a lot more money for the process. So in that regard, I'm tending to want to support the steps up by Councilman Brosnan. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if I can help clarify, this is done. This really is designed where the city manager will not have authority over the director. They don't report to me, which is currently the CBC staff report to me. They report to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you will hire them. You will fire them. All the things that Linda mentioned, the ability to review, the ability to be on site. None of that requires city manager involvement. There was a provision, though, to say in the event that we say we want them to be more involved in an investigation, that's when the city manager'",
        "'speaker_7': 'could request that they be more involved in those lives, their duties. But all the reviews, what they pick, what they choose to look at, how they make the recommendations. The city manager has no involvement in that. I can't direct them and I don't want to I want them to be completely independent from me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just wanted to make that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I'm going to go back to actually Councilman Austin. Councilman Price, I want to make some comments and then we'll go through the votes count on behalf of our outfit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Listen, I understand we have an election coming up in November. Right. And, you know, there are there are those on this council who are enthusiastic about, you know, making change and and getting something done right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm I want to get something done, but I want it to be done right. I would. Our charter gives the city council the authority to direct the city manager. Because we we are elected by the legislative body. We can direct the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't do that. Direct any other personnel in the city. A city manager. Right. Since then, almost every council item one before the council. Right. We hired a city manager. We fired a city manager. Some wonder what's being proposed here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is in order. Model that. The City Council would hire. Right. But nowhere in this does it say that the city council has any sort of authority to direct that individual. Two votes. Right. But you hear now is that the city manager has the ability to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And so I think there's a there's a flaw here that that is one that that. Needs to be considered strongly. Again, I support civilian oversight. I work on one of what are the civilian oversight process to have achieved and be well versed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I want to be thorough with it and I want they good policy. And I think, you know, there's a lot to be desired here. I'm really concerned about the excess cost. And and there's no guarantee that we're going to get the return award on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why are voters and by the way, you can send anything related to civilian oversight to the voters. They're probably going to pass it. Right. We understand that. We understand that. Just like, you know, there's a there's a number of other things that you just put before the voters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're going to vote for it because in theory, they support it. Everybody supports oversight, but I think they want good policy and they want us and they're looking to us to bring forward good policy. Sound policy. But we are being fiscally responsible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are we are we are we checking the boxes? And again, to Councilmember Michael's point, this does feel a bit bit rushed. You know, and again, we should not put something on the ballot just to say that we did it to check the box.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's make sure we get it right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I did want to highlight what the city manager just reiterated, that allowing the city manager to initiate an investigation or review does not mean that the director is precluded from doing so. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Leicester City manager.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. Can you rephrase that? I wasn't quite following the question. Can you say that again?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So. So the language that Councilman Super not talked about with the provisions that allow the city manager to request an investigation or a review does not preclude the director from being able to look into matters. It's just that if they don't and the city manager wants them to or thinks that they should, they can direct them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think the issue is the review versus investigation. The investigation is is conducting a specific investigation. And since that's not their role anymore, that would be with the police department, unless it was specifically requested by the city manager in certain instances as like an extra step on top of what police is doing for the reviews or'",
        "'speaker_7': 'anything. They want to ask questions about if they want to know about a specific complaint and what happened. They have no, they don't have to ask me. They don't have to do anything. They have the full authority to do and review at anything and everything.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All policies, even specific investigations they're allowed to pull and say, I want to see 10% of all investigations that are done and review every single one of those and have all access. And they don't need city manager approval at all for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is just if we ask them to go into an investigative mode where, for example, if the chief of police comes under a complaint, I need to do that separately. Then in the police department, we would have the ability to request this commission to do that for us, and they would look at it completely independently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. You know, I understand. I appreciate everyone's comments and I definitely do understand where everyone's coming from. But, you know, I what I don't understand is the reference to this as being this 11th hour kind of decision. We've been talking about this charter amendment for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've taken input. We've offered comments and. And I think there's been a lot of. Input into this process already. And I think that. The voters and the residents of the city want to see us move forward with a model that's better than what we currently have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It may not be the perfect model. It may need adjustments down the road. It may need us to make further modifications in the form of additional amendments by vote of the people in the future. But I think that we've been working towards progress and my thoughts and I completely hear what you're saying, Councilman Austin, but my thoughts'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are if we were to go with the substitute substitute. Where does that leave us in terms of any major modifications to the commission? Does that then put us in a situation where we're looking at additional recommendations by consultants for additional models for the next election cycle?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because if that's the case, then I don't know that that's fair to the voters who have been engaged in this process up to this point. So maybe if I can have some clarification on that, because, you know, we've we've been engaged.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've all been asking questions. We've been talking to people. Some of us have talked about this, the community meetings. And so I think the process that we've we've arrived at today, to me, does not seem like an 11th hour.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that that could just be to me. But I'd like to hear your thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, what you haven't heard is the city manager say that that he doesn't know or they lack the authority to create a hybrid model that actually can implement some of these recommendations without going to the ballot. And maybe that's a question for the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that possible? And what can you do to create a hybrid body model that goes beyond the investigative model of potentially includes some of the review and potential maybe auditor authority? Can we create a position? I mean, without going to a ballot?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, is that possible? Can we tweak this this model under our current with our current model? So this is time to take your time. But that's a that's a question for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think those are very fair questions. So I don't view it as taking my time at all. I love the answers to those questions as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, this time. So we didn't cover it tonight, but there were recommendations in the police report on how to improve the current CBC model. And if you remember back when we presented that to you back in February, when we made this decision, do we move down this road or not?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We gave the option. If we don't, we would still recommend that you make improvements to the CBC. There are things, though, that we're not able to change in the charter. It specifies what they do and what they're not allowed to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so those we would not be able to change without going back to a charter amendment. But in terms of adding investigative staff, in terms of improving the way that we report on things, you know, there's a number of those that we can review with you that are in the report that we think are good ideas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So one way or the other, whether you support this tonight or if we don't support it tonight, we would be making changes to the CBC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And let me let me go back to Councilman Price and kind of wrap up this debate. Councilman Price, you have any additional comments or questions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The only thing that I wanted to comment on is a lot of the frustration for me is the lack of structure right now for this auditor position, for this director position. And I know that we I asked about it last week and we said that at some point once the charter amendment goes to the voters, then we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'would sit down and we would talk about the structure. But my concern about the position is it sounds great in theory, but I'm worried that the position could be politicized by virtue of the fact that it reports to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I mean, you know, no offense to our current structure, but, you know, people count the votes and they see where the majority is and priorities shift based on where the votes are. And that's a to me, that's a fundamental flaw with just our current process right now that we have with our city manager structure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't want to see that structure. And that that's that's that's not to criticize anyone. I'm just saying it's a flaw in the process. And I would hate to see that floor carried over to an important role like this, because what we don't want is a role like this to be politicized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I understand the structure of this position is not something that would be formed prior to being approved by the voters. But that is a concern that I have that I want to make sure that I articulate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They could count on. I think that any other I don't see any other council comments on the on the board. I want to make some comment and then we'll go to our series of votes. So I'm just going to just say a few broad comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do appreciate all the comments we heard today, and I especially appreciate what I'm sorry, Councilman Mungo, additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I would just amend my from the amendment to say not only should we consider the stopping, but regardless of whether or not this goes on the ballot, I think that Mr. Votacao should start a process of implementing those things that were recommended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or at least bring back a list of those things that were recommended by the consultant that we can implement immediately. October one with the resources and that would be my modified friendly. Councilmember Austin's okay with it and I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Regardless of what happens, I proposed the same to Councilwoman Sorrell. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To that end, that's what we want to hear. So I certainly accept that from the can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That's for the motion that's on the floor. So let me go back and save a few a few comments. So I want to just first say that I do appreciate the different opinions of the council and the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a really important topic, and I think the reason why folks are struggling is because we have a system currently in place that does not work. I think we gotta be very clear about what's happened over the last couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We started out this endeavor with this idea that we believe the PCC needed to have reform. And in talking to folks that currently serve, that have served in the past, it's no question that many of the folks that currently serving have served also believe that it needs to be reform more broadly speaking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have to remember that we've been working within the confines of something that the public has passed, and it's been in place now for decades. At the end of the day, the idea of a reformed and reformed commission is to provide more police accountability for there to be more direct accountability from the public to our police department'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and to build trust. The current system we have and we've had incredible people serving on it, including two members of our city council, is not providing the level of oversight that I believe this moment and the public have demanded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we can choose to continue doing what we've been doing in the past. That, in my opinion, has not worked. But there have been there have been good efforts. And the people that serve on these commissions have done really, really great work and have worked really hard to be the best possible commissioners that they can be'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So this is not on them. It's a system that we have in place or we can actually try to make some reforms and created more a system that is more accountable, which I believe the public has been demanding in protests and letters in coming before us and asking us to do more in in this area personally, particularly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'during the George Floyd protests that happened and all the actions around Black Lives Matter that were happening. I personally made a commitment to many community members that we would look at the PCC as a place that needed reform.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To me, I think at the center of what makes this proposal strong is the auditor system that is appointed accountable to. The City Council. And in a democracy, any time you make a position more accountable or directly accountable to the body, which is accountable to the public, I think it's a stronger system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The the city council only appoints a not even a handful of physicians. You appoint a city manager and you appoint a city clerk. Those are the two positions that actually this body actually hires. This would create a third direct report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where you would have an auditor system but is also accountable to the council. And the council is the democratic representative of the public. And if the public demands change are going to go through the council, they go to the mayor and sort of create a system where you don't have a layer of bureaucracy which currently exists within'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the system we have now. And the city manager, you're actually creating a position that is as close to the public as possible, in my opinion, in a representative government, which is why I think this model is so unique.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has, and I think the potential is really strong. I also want to add, as far as it concerned, some of the concerns that were brought up and I respect all of them. I'm not concerned with costs. This is a incredibly important issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you know what? We're talking about 100 hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars. We're talking about ensuring that people feel that their law enforcement is accountable to the public. And so I think the cost is worth the investment that the city should make.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think we think that the public has demanded us to invest in ways that bring transparency. And I think this this reform commission is able to do so. I will also just note that. This initial proposal was brought to the Council in February, I believe it was February, January, February, and the staff have been working at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the direction and input of the Council to actually present what it actually is in front of us. So this has been a a build building block on building block of different types of suggestions from from the public. And I will also say, see this and I disagree some I actually trust voters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that that people can go to the ballot and make decisions on what's in front of them. And I do believe that we either choose to continue the system we have now for another couple of years because this would not be able to be on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a charter amendment, I believe, until 2024. Or we put a different model in front of the voters for them to decide. But this other additional model could be better. I personally believe this model that that is being proposed by staff and the consultants and the community input is a better model.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it the exact model that I personally would have written or designed myself? I think it would have been something that I may have made different, but it's a consensus that staff and folks that you guys consulted, including current commissioners, former commissioners in the community developed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I do support moving forward with this recommendation of putting this on the ballot. I understand that other folks may not support that, and that's okay. And we have different opinions on that. But I will add that there are very few things that are stronger than a new direct report to this body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One which I will not serve on you will all of you will still be here, and that the public can hold this council accountable to the actions of the auditor and how the auditor is monitoring and investigating any issues that relates to law enforcement, the police department, which is which is why I support bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to the public to vote on it. I believe, Councilman, I'll see you cued up again. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Mr. Mayor, you said a lot there. I won't respond to everything, but I will just say that I will remind everybody here that I was the city council member about for the initial motion to request for reform of the P.C.C.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I still very strongly support reforming the PCC. I think I've talked about starving thought PCC for many years. And with all due respect, Mr. Mayor, you have 14 years to care about funding PCC and civilian oversight. We haven't gotten to that point yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we could throw we could have we could have put a lot of resources into the existing model that we have to to to build that public confidence, to build the public trust, to to to ingratiate that that that commission with the voters and with the residents of the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We failed. And I would say as a collective body, the city council has failed in that regard and we need to eat it. So if my motion fails tonight, that's fine. I mean, you've weighed in, Mr. Mayor. That's great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will support the subsequent motion to put this on the ballot, if that's the case. But I can't guarantee you that that I will I will recommend people vote for this, because I see some inherent flaws in the policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I think we can do a lot better without going to the ballot. I think we could we could we could fix this internally. Everything doesn't need to go to the ballot. And and when go to a constitutional amendment right, the only way to fix it is going back to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. That's that's if we've learned anything from from this this exercise 30 years ago when Alan Lowenthal brought the PCC, the existing model to the city of Long Beach, a city council member, and he championed this as a as a model.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are now, 30 years later, looking to amend it because the only way we can do that is go into the ballot. Right. But I also say that there are there are tools that we can employ as a city council and with our city manager to fix the model.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There were a number of recommendations in that study that we're well aware of, and obviously that wasn't part of the presentation. There are a number of recommendations in this study that could be employed and put forward tomorrow to fix the PCC and make it a more robust commission and more responsive to the residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I'm done. I'm happy to take the vote getting a vote now in the end of the session.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. We're going to go to a vote. I accept. I heard Councilman Price's additional comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just have one clarifying question, Mr. Mayor. If we wanted to have additional changes and we didn't put it on the ballot tonight or approve this, would it be 2024? Would that be the next time or would it be 2020 when one would be the next opportunity?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. America.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Charter changes are only allowed on the general election, so every two years you can do a charter change.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': '2024.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you. We have a motion by Councilmember Austin and second by Councilwoman Mango. That is a sub substitute motion. Please roll call and cast your votes, please.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We have the substitute motion, which I believe was by Councilwoman Sato and I believe the second with the Councilwoman Allen. And we'll do a roll call vote, please, on the Councilman Sato's motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Excuse me, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Know that. I think.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Considered on this motion if it was going to be heard. And I don't know that there's been an acceptance of those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I haven't heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I haven't heard an acceptance of the friendlies. Is there. Would you want to repeat those really quickly? Councilman Mongo?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. I would like to request a friendly amendment to the motion on the floor that. Regardless of if the voters approve or don't approve the ballot initiative in November that effective in October through our budget process, we allocate funds to step up the DCC and work and ask the city manager to bring back a list'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the recommendations that were provided by the consultant that he plans to implement. Immediately. Thank you. I will accept your initial friendly to look to supporting the CPC, but not the additional second part of the friendly that was added later to looking at a list of stuff that additional additional.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just. Well, let's take the part about looking into supporting CPC, looking at the funding source. Additionally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So that part of the family's been accepted and comes in. Councilman Allen, you accept? Okay, so roll call vote, please.'",
