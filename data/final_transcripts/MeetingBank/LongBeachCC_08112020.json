        "'speaker_7': 'and local focus on violence. Also as a public health crises and the need to utilize public health methods to address it. COVID 19 brought to light the impacts of underlying health conditions, overcrowded housing and poverty. This year brought us together as departments, employees and community to address common goals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The level of partnership is unprecedented and so essential. I want to give a huge shout out to all the department who are engaged in the pandemic response, as well as their support for racial equity and reconciliation efforts. I also want to give another huge shout out to our Health Department, Health and Human Services Services team for their'",
        "'speaker_7': 'dedication, commitment and passion for their work. It has really been elevated in these COVID times. The Health Department offers over 40 public facing programs across the lifespan from prenatal to end of life. We work in and for every community in our city.'",

We're building systems to improve access to early childhood and older adult services. We house people. We enhance opportunities, policies and systems to address health and social inequities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Health Department is also a vital component of the public safety continuum in Long Beach. We plan daily to ensure the city is prepared for what we are facing right now. We coordinate emergency shelter, response and services. We lead bioterrorism efforts for the city and the region.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our environmental health team coordinates the response to hazardous waste threats and ensures all restaurants and waters are safe. We lead violence prevention efforts through safe Long Beach, and we immunize against public health threats. The impact of Cove on our department has been steep.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Health Department's Emergency Planning and Communicable Diseases team is fewer than 15 people in normal times, and they are all grant funded. The COVID pandemic far exceeds this team's capacity to respond, as well as public health capacity to respond across the nation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Given the chronic under-resourcing of public health locally and at all government levels in our health department, many programs and people were assigned to COVID response beginning in March. Almost all of those that you see are those teams that you see are grant funded as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Reassignments vary. For instance, ours from our HIV team led the coordination of Medical Reserve Corps for the Rapid Assessment Clinic, worked in the jet, producing information, provided interpretation at the mayor's pressers, and also participated in gear and the race conversations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our veteran services coordinator is managing the call center. Our Community Health Bureau manager designed and managed the isolation and quarantine site. The list goes on.

        "'speaker_7': 'Prior to COVID 19, the Public Health Emergency Management Team received a grant to support the distribution center, which became a lifeline in our to our city team and managing media partners for PPE and Food. Our public health lab ran tests before any other testing was available.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Test sites have served over 88,000 people, and a communicable disease team has investigated nearly 8000 positive cases. The same team, I'll response also responded to 22 skilled nursing center outbreaks, of which 13 have no new cases in the last two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The team partnered with the Venue Task Force to educate more than 8000 businesses, including supporting restaurants to reopen safely during the pandemic. We established a warm line for older adults, family members of older adults, agencies who work with older adults, and others who are self-isolating due to health conditions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Chronic Disease Team made it possible to distribute 245,000 of food to 3500 households. And we also opened two emergency shelters and isolation and quarantine site for people experiencing homelessness and those who cannot safely isolate at home. To date, we have had no COVID 19 outbreaks among our city's homeless population.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Despite the challenges COVID 19 has presented, the Health Department has continued to deliver services in many of its programs. These accomplishments include identifying and investigating the largest restaurant associated hepatitis A outbreak in California in years. This team interviewed over 200 individuals and conducted an extensive outbreak investigation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our workplace work has grown by over 3200 families due to COVID and now is serving nearly 18,000 households. The Safe Language Team established a collaborative partnership with 15 community based organizations in the Washington neighborhood to address gun violence, neighborhood empowerment and built and built environment factors that impact people's quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the Medical Outreach and Health Access Team has enrolled over 1500 people in health insurance. We continue to address mosquito and other vector borne diseases and can take and conduct safety inspections. The number of HIV tests double this year to nearly 2000 tests for our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've also strengthened fatherhood skills and families within our family and in families within our city. Many of our direct service programs are now conducted by telephone or video. In terms of homelessness, we're managing $52 million in homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This includes the $9 million purchase of the ABC shelter 3.7 million for Project ROOMKEY If that is approved, 1 million spent on COVID sheltering. It also includes a reduction of measure funding at the point of $2 million. The remainder of the funds are for prevention, outreach, coordination and rapid rehousing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're opening 125 bed shelter this September, and the MSI has had nearly 8500 visits in this time of COVID, and the CRC has personally housed nearly 1400 people this year. We've also had we also have nearly 7600 households who are permanent housing through the housing authority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we received 45 additional vouchers this year for veterans and tenant protection. The Family Self-sufficiency Program graduated 21 participants with a combined earnings of over $200,000. The current health department budget is just under $158 million. This does not include the one time funds for COVID 19 response.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The housing authority continues to be the largest of our funds, followed by the Health Fund. The general fund is now approximately 3% of the health budget. With the addition of the Hart team in the budget. Notable changes to the general fund this year include $414 for $414,000 for three new positions as the Hart team restructures to the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Health Department and 1.5 million for racial equity and reconciliation efforts. The new structure for the Hart team will allow for two response teams made up of a public health nurse, mental health practitioner and two outreach workers. This will allow for medical and mental health response across the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Seven days per week, this meets the Council and community requests for increased medical and mental health support for homeless population. The 1.5 million designated for racial equity and reconciliation efforts will focus on youth development, violence prevention and health equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Proactive Homeless Initiative will be funded at the same level as last year, with one time funds of $255,000. The Office of Equity is moving from the Health Department to the city manager's team, and the two FTEs for the cannabis positions there were previously funded by the General Fund will be allocated to the health fund.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These costs will be offset by permit revenues. In the health front, we are adding ten PhDs for administrative, finance and accounting supports to effectively manage nearly $49 million in new grants and contracts. These positions are grant funded and will continue as long as funding is available in programs across the department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At this time, we're looking at expenditures of $69 million for testing, surge staffing, surveillance, contact tracing, AP data efforts and homelessness. Our current one time response funding totals $49 million. So there's a gap of $20 million. The expectation is that FEMA will reimburse testing efforts to fill the gap between expenditures and the resources.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Over the past seven years, the Health Department has efficiently managed its annual budgets to build an $11 million reserve to ensure we'd be prepared for times like this, a pandemic response, and cuts to budgets outside of the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We expect this fund to take a large hit this year to cover the expenses. Our racial equity and reconciliation funding will allow the Department to open a new Office of Youth Development, strengthen existing violence prevention efforts out of focus on reentry, and continue the department's equity efforts focusing specifically on health and housing equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Office of Youth Development will coordinate programs and investments with community based organizations and city programs in Long Beach. This would be staffed by a program manager, a program coordinator and two peer navigators. Funding would go to use serving organizations to create young leaders and also leverage and expand the city's workforce and parks programing for recreation, youth'",

Interruption strategies in communities most impacted by violence. The Health Department's Center for Families and Youth in North Palm Beach is currently being remodeled and will house the Center for Health Equity, which will be focused on providing and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'coordinating services that focus on building health opportunities for communities most impacted by racism.

        "'speaker_7': 'well as other key health issues impacting those across the city. Funding would also be utilized to increase food access and sustainability, as well as ongoing health department efforts such as fatherhood, black infant health, Medi-Cal enrollment and mental health supports.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Health equity has really taken a front seat during these COVID times as we see the impacts of underlying health conditions and overcrowded housing and the case rates of our Latinx population and hospitalizations and deaths among our black population.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For housing equity. The Health Department is in the process of hiring a coordinator for the Everyone Home Line Beach Plan. Three Efforts to reach the goals outlined in that plan. This coordinator will include a focus on equity and homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We do face challenges because the Health Department is primarily a grant funded organization. There's little funding for administrative functions such as finance contracts and human resources. The status makes it even greater challenge to respond to an influx in funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is exacerbated by the aggressive timelines of the federal funding funding coming to the city. Don't get me wrong, we appreciate every dollar coming in and our community needs it, but it requires that we immediately build a capacity to manage it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our grant funds have been hit as we've reassigned people to COVID response. When this happened, staff are not drawing down their grant funds, which impacts our overall funding picture now and in the future. Staff building to grants isn't an absolute essential thing to draw down the funds that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The state health re-alignment funding to local health jurisdictions was cut by approximately 10%, which is over $800,000 for the city of Long Beach. The state is working to backfill these funds with approximately $550,000. This will help but continues to leave our department with a $300,000 reduction in our structural funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The uncertainty of the length of the pandemic and future impacts challenge our planning and funding efforts. As discussed before, the department's fund balance is taking a big hit through this pandemic. We do have opportunities. The CARES Act funding brings a real opportunity to partner with community based organizations to provide key supports to people in our city who'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are most impacted by COVID. We are establishing infrastructures to support food access, early child and older adult supports, basic needs and so much more into our future. The Racial Equity and reconciliation focus on youth development, trauma, violence prevention, health and housing equity will bring much needed structural funding to essential efforts to create a healthier and safer future'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in Long Beach. Additional federal funding may become available to support response and recovery efforts. The department has been planning for the implementation of a coordinated entry technology system to improve access and coordination of services in the department, as well as improve data on our services to be utilized for quality improvement efforts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is moving forward this year. The increased focus on public health planning and services at all levels of government and community allows a broader conversation about health and public safety and the necessity of investing in upstream preventions. Building a social context for Health and wellness.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And finally, we also have 107 more permanent housing units coming online for our homeless population. Our Health and Human Services Department stands for the health and well-being of this great city and look forward to partnering with you, our community members, community organizations and our other city departments to ensure all are thriving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for the opportunity to present a snapshot of our efforts in the midst of these COVID times. That concludes my presentation, and I'm open for questions.'",

We also provide training and education that is essential to the delivery of our core fire and rescue services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would now like to present some of the fire department's accomplishments and highlights for the current fiscal year. Over the past 12 months, we've responded to over 73,000 fire, emergency medical services, marine safety and other emergency incidents. Since many incidents require multiple units to respond, these 73,000 incidents equate to more than 150,000 unit responses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Included in this number are over 50,000 medical calls and over 6500 fire calls. This number also includes hazardous materials responses, airport responses and other non fire responses. Our Operations Bureau hired and trained a diverse class of 23 new ambulance operators to state to staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our basic life support program in our training division turned out a diverse class of 23 new firefighters. These were both great investments in the fire department's futures. I'm immensely proud of the work that the men and women of the fire department have done this year from the very beginning of the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They responded, as they always do. Heading directly towards danger and potential harm to the to themselves to do their job, never knowing which patients might be infected with COVID 19. Fire staff has also been critical to the citywide response to this prolonged incident.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Back in March, fire staff was instrumental in standing up the incident management team with their knowledge of and experience with the incident command system. Our chief officers led the charge in this area quickly providing leadership and educating city staff and management from all departments in both the Incident Management Team and the Emergency Operations Center, and providing structure'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Our Fire Prevention Bureau promoted community safety and economic growth by conducting over 11,000 residential construction and business related fire safety inspections. The department conducted over 200 arson investigations, which resulted in over 30 arrests. Our Community Emergency Response Team or CERT program once again proved to be a valuable community asset this year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our trained CERT volunteers contributed over 3500 hours of service for the COVID 19 response. One of the highlights of our diversity recruitment program was our first ever girls camp. This was a one day event at the David Rosa Regional Training Center, where 40 young women were provided information on careers in the fire service.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In addition, they had the opportunity to meet with some of our staff role models where real fire, fire turnouts and helmets and obtain some hands on experience with the tools we use in the fire service.

First, there is a structural reduction of $1.9 million in Fire's general fund budget in fiscal year 21. This will be offset by a one year delay in the collection of capital recovery charges for our fleet of vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Each year, the Fleet Services Bureau charges the fire department $1.9 million in capital recovery charges in the general fund, which goes into a vehicle replacement fund. By not charging us these capital recovery charges in fiscal year 21. We will delay a replacement of fire apparatus by one year, resulting in a slightly older fleet over the years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're operating a relatively young fleet of vehicles. 60% of our front line emergency response vehicles are five years old or newer, and we are therefore confident that this change will not negatively impact operations. Since. Since this is a one time reduction, we will be required to submit an ongoing structural reduction to replace this in subsequent fiscal years'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Additionally, the budget proposal includes a one time strategic investment of $200,000 to conduct a comprehensive fire operations study, which will identify efficiencies and potential areas of improvement. The proposed budget also includes the elimination of our two heart units and transfer of program responsibilities to the Department of Health and Human Services, who will operate the program with nurses'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and or social workers. By all accounts, the heart team has been a great success. However, when faced with make with making reductions of this magnitude, it was important to us to instead maintain our core services of fire and emergency medical response.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Fire's proposed budget also includes several investments in the general fund. First is the addition of a new civilian fire inspector position. This position will work closely with development services to improve compliance with codes, laws, regulations and ordinances related to fire building and hazardous materials.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The position will be funded through fires Memorandum of Understanding with Development Services. Additionally, partial funding is recommended to continue the Fire Diversity Recruitment Program for an additional year.

Again, I want to thank the City Council for your support of this important program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Finally, faced with a large reduction target in the title and fund, we had to make the difficult recommendation to reduce seasonal non-career lifeguard staffing by 10%, which will result in 5 to 7 fewer lifeguards on the beach on any given summer day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're also proposing the elimination of one Marine safety officer, which will reduce the number of year round trained marine safety professionals and will require changes to the way that we manage our junior lifeguard program.

        "'speaker_0': 'And when we get there, I'd like to pull up page 13 on the Health Department's report. Mr. Dennis, welcome to the team. You've hit the ground running. We have a great Parks and Recreation Department. It's difficult times right now, but I know that it's important to the public.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So again, welcome and look forward to working with you. Chief Espino Great. I'm glad that you highlighted a lot of your success with the fire diversity recruitment. This was an important priority of the city council. I've been paying attention to this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So great job. You have very visible changes. And, you know, I'm hearing good things about the academy that you've been able to see some of the benefits of the fire diversity program. Can you speak just briefly to how the academy is shaping up?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Councilman, can you repeat the question one more time, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just just briefly, can you speak to the diversity when within like since you brought on this diversity recruiting program, what outcomes are we seeing with the with the current academy?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So with the current academy that's coming up, it's a very diverse academy, I want to say on the order of 50%, either by gender and or ethnicity. And that also reflects what we we had just recently with our Engineers Academy with the same graduation rate and typical diversity as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. I'm just glad to see that. And I've been following the Junior Lifeguard program and all those things, so we're excited about the future. Another, we're gonna have some difficult budget years. So moving forward, you know, I'd like to see more creativity in efficiencies and, you know, in revenue options so that we can prevent service cuts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't we don't want to lose engine 12. We don't want to lose rescue 12. Again, we saw what it was like without that. And so we know what's up against this next year or, you know, we're all going to have to work together and figure out some creative solutions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I'd love to learn more about some of these. We focus on the heart themes, but those questions will have for for health. But thank you so much. And the other thing is, I love that you spoke to succession planning and training.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's really important to maintain a great culture. You really want to make sure that you you brought up, you know, use these opportunities to bring young people up into leadership. So so thank you. And keep up the good work, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for thinking, Miss Collopy, on health. First of all, thank you for leading with health on the Health presentation. First, I think it's certainly appropriate given what we're dealing with in the pandemic. If we could pull up the health presentation, go to page 13.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's where I want to where where I want to start. So I'm glad to see that particularly this year, we're being nimble and responsive. We learned a lot this year about the way health impacts and the way it breaks down is along poverty lines, along racial lines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How it breaks down. One May economy recession. Okay. Okay, so so man it threw me off being I was on a roll. So yeah. Can you just speak to that? I want to speak to as I see these investments and they're really good and I think we'll have more time to talk about them later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the housing and homeless equity position, what I see here is that there's you know, we're dealing with a lot with respect to renters nowadays. And we've got housing authority, we've got rental assistance, all these things. And we want to place a focus on homeownership and and we have a homelessness issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How is Colby? How are we going to make sure this housing equity position is situated to sort of streamline all of those doors into one door? That's easy for people to get to because I'd like to ultimately see one front door housing, rental housing division within the city that can deal with, you know, our rental issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it applies to racial equity as well, given 80% of African-Americans rent in Long Beach and 70% Latino. So could you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Councilmember So the focus of this at this time is really around the issues, around homeless homeless equity. We find an overrepresentation among our black population, within our homeless population. The other piece of it is the Everyone Home plan itself has a lot of focus on bringing forth affordable housing, rental and others.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I think the starting point would be to leverage the person that is coming on through the Everyone Home plan and then to work throughout this year to establish the single office and bring that back to you for next year to move forward with that opening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Go for it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next to councilman, you venga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to also thank the presenters, come up to speed on Denis for their work on this budget. And it's very tough, a lot of things to do. I'm going to start with health tourism with the first one up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to congratulate the occupants and they're doing exactly what I've been wanting to do for the last several years. And that's to welcome to analyze much of the separates is that you make it structural so that they're not always have to rely on grants and other funding to provide the services that they do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm very happy to see that, and I hope that we're able to do even more in the coming years to structurally fund the whole department into the city's family. And that had to rely on grant. So I just want to say that the other part of the presentation did not did not address some of the other'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bureaus or what of what's going on with law or preventive health and the environmental health services. I especially interested in that one because we still have what we've had as COVID 19. We still have a West Nile virus out there in the comedian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And well, we've been very successful in controlling West Nile. What is the status of the Environmental Services Bureau?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So our Environmental Health Bureau at this time said this past year they've responded to over 500 requests for the mosquito control and identified nine over 900 mosquitoes for vector borne borne disease surveillance. So they are working throughout all of this pandemic, doing exactly what they do every year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have had one West Nile case in the city that I'm aware of. And it was the you know, it was one of the first ones in Southern California. So they continue to do that work, as well as the food safety inspections are working very closely with the restaurant at this time so that they can comply with'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the health order as well, ensuring that they can operate safely, you know, outside and kitchens and all those other pieces. So they're spending a lot of time in the field right now around health inspections as well. And then they're doing the pool inspections and the water testing and all the other events that they do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would I be accurate in saying that the Environmental Services Bureau is doing their work in the capacity and funding that they currently have?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, they are. We are in the process of hiring additional inspectors because of the increased demand on their time and work. And they are sort of at the limit in terms of the resources they have available to them for the work that they can be doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He will. Thank you for all you've done to keep his funeral pyre a little bit about what Councilmember Richardson brought up and Kennedy roommate. Very glad to see that you have that every single plan in place. That's another item that I have been wanting to see over the years to improve and get more institutionalization on there instead'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of doing it on a per recruitment strategy, something that you're doing year round and always looking at that. How you reviewed what you might be expecting in terms of attrition the next two or three years and what it might look like for your staffing, as well as the possibility of additional academies two or three years out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilman. So on a normal basis, we anticipate approximately 12 retirements per year. That includes all ranks. We expect to see the same this year just based on our conversations with our workforce, with the academies, the system that we have set up now where we are testing annually and producing a an academy on an annual basis'",
        "'speaker_8': 'seems to give us a robust workforce, and I think that will keep us in line with maintaining our workforce. Of course, we're going to have to adapt and shift as the situation presents itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I'm glad to hear that as well as with you have ever seen recruitment. I'm sure that we're going to be continuing to diversify our fire department at all levels. I appreciate that very much. Thank you. What a pleasure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One minute. One last question, and that is DMSO that you have targeted for elimination. I know I heard you correctly in your presentation. Yes, sorry about that. This whole works with your lifeguards. Would that be severely affecting that program at our class B or C that we had last week?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Price and I really supported that program. We want to we want to see it continue. And so with this, MSO basically have a deleterious effect on that program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There would be a shift in responsibilities for who is administering the program. It would go from an MSO to Marine safety captain and also an analyst would be assisting with that process. So it would look different. And the responsibilities that the MSO currently has would have to be basically taken on by others.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, my well, my question really relies on whether there would be a negative effect on the lifeguard program or sea right now. Cabrillo High School, Jordan High School schools up in all that are very well removed from the beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need that exposure. So, I mean, it wasn't when you were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Younger, so you could fill up again if you like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Boy, can I just finish up my question and then move on? Okay. Thank you. So, Tom, so basically those are the concerns that I have with the with the local programing. And and you're seeing they might look different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, sir. You have a question? Do you have an answer to that?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. So as far as we know, the junior lifeguard program will continue with Mitchell gone. But it would be a marine safety captain, so it's going to look a bit different. We would still have a junior guard system, but it's going to be administered in a different direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the responsibilities that the MSL currently has would have to be farmed out to others within the organization. But the to my knowledge, the program that's at Jordan and Cabrillo and forwarding all of that, that will not be harmed in any way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. That's all I have, I swear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Since we're already with Chief Espino, I think so. We'll have to clean the microphone. My question would start with Cuba funds. So are you aware that there were some findings of agencies in the region and they met with the state and were able to designate their fines and fees to a local fire agency?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry, can you repeat the question?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You talked about Cuba funds. Yes. Yes. So are there other a battalion chief for another fire agency mentioned to me that there were some businesses in the region, not in Long Beach, that had some violations. And when the violations occur, there are significant fines levied and associated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Typically, those fines are paid to a state agency. However, there was a recent lawsuit, I guess, that allows them to designate to give those funds to local agencies. Would you be open to looking into that and coming back to us in 6 to 8 weeks with a notice of whether or not we could start getting those funds'",
        "'speaker_1': 'directed to our agency, and that if we could start sending out letters after violations so that the revenue could come directly to us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I would certainly be open to that. As stated earlier in the presentation, there is going to be a study of all things. Oops. All things. Fire department. And that would be something that we'd certainly look at. We're looking at different areas of the fire department as well in regards to billing and fines and fees and recouping'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those cost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Related to. And the additional increases of gate fees. Mr. MODICA I know that you'd stated that gig fees cannot be levied to one set of zip codes versus another set of zip codes separately or at different price points.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But would you be open to creating a program where local residents could volunteer hours at a park or something of the such, where they could become some kind of ambassador, at which time they would be eligible for a lifetime reduced price or entrance fees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if I understand the question correctly, it should. Can we look at a program where if you're volunteering and helping in the park, you get lower level of fees in terms of access to your annual passes that it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Something like that where their fees would stay the same. I know that our original intent was to raise fees for those who don't live in Long Beach. Since most tax dollars actually are. All support for Eldorado Park at this time comes from Long Beach taxpayers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so my goal would be that Long Beach taxpayers don't have to pay additional to get into the park. However, other cities have taxpayers whose taxes go to their own parks. But because Eldorado Regional Park is such a desirable location, many of those residents use our parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am very supportive of the optimization of the front gate that would come from these fees. But I'm also of the mind that we do have a large number of Saturday cleanups now and other things. And so if members of our community took a pledge of some sort to help clean up the park and or to always'",
        "'speaker_1': 'follow the rules or any of those things, if they could get a discounted rate, which would be the current rate versus allowing that increase to go to people who don't participate in cleaning up our park, continue to violate the rules and are not local residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think we can take a look at that. So we need to show that there was some kind of benefit that we received from their engagement. And there are a lot of really good volunteers that help out at the park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we can take a look at that. And I think the item you were referring to is we did explore whether or not we could charge a higher fee for those who don't live in Long Beach. But because we've taken some money in the past, too, you know, that was kind of either state money or county money'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We are not allowed to do that at this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will further bring up that. I know that at the time I brought this up before was not in a public forum. So I think it's a poignant to bring it up now so that the community can hear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are libraries who have taken regional county funds, hundreds of thousands of dollars of regional county, thousands, if not millions recently from the county and the city of St specifically. And they have a library that only services Cerritos residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you are not a Street Post resident, you cannot participate in that library. So I would be very interested to know what. Special thing that they did that allowed for that same kind of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Program right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One man.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That access where our park is not eligible for the same types of restrictions. And then I just want to close with health services and wait. Let me. Youth sports fees. I second the mayor's comments that you support fees to not increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're in a time where youth sports is going to be on the brink of being able to survive. They're not able to play competitive play only practices. So they're at a place where they're going to have to reduce fees, not increase fees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm hoping that the city manager will bring forward alternatives to fix the funding gap created by not increasing our youth sports fees. I don't know what other options we have, but I don't think increasing youth sports fees is going to make sense, especially since they're going to have a significant reduction in utilization.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that that supply and demand is going to be an interesting one and it won't solve our problem. And finally, I just want to thank our Health Services Department and all our city employees who participated in the COVID response.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that you guys did excellent work, and I think you've demonstrated a need that we have in our city to invest in health. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Councilman Longo Price, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So a couple of comments. I just want to let me start with fire. And I know that Chief has talked a little bit about the whole program and touched on our lifeguards. I know that both Councilman Pierce and I are probably very plugged in to the great work that our lifeguards do every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'day. I am disappointed to see the reduction in their budget, especially in the areas where there are proposed reductions. I realize that we have some tremendous strains on Taiwan's budget right now and that that revenue source is going down and it's somewhat unpredictable because it's reliant on oil.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm hoping, Mr. City Manager, that we can figure out a way to fix the tide once. Allocation for lifeguards this year for FY 21 to allow them to continue operating at the level that they were. And then instead of cutting them now, require a proposal that they could submit for restructuring that we can consider next year'",
        "'speaker_1': 'if their budget is impacted by tidelands declines. And let me tell you why. I don't know if Chief has been our or I don't know if Deputy Chief Medina's is there or available can talk to a little bit about the rescues, talk to the rescue operations that have happened over the last year and how critical those are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not just to the individuals who were rescued, but also to the community who witnessed who experienced trauma as a result. And just having the security of having the lifeguards out there, especially with our increased beach activation. So Chief Espinoza or Deputy Chief Medina, can either of you speak to some of the efforts of our lifeguards in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'area of rescue?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council member Chief Medina here. Just a quick a quick recap on our rescues. Two Sundays ago at the Colorado Lagoon, an eight year old boy and 14 year old sister were playing at the lagoon. And the eight year old boy stepped off a drop off and began to drown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The 14 year old sister, in an effort to render aid, reached down but was pulled down by the 14 year old, by the eight year old boy. Both of them were under water when our lifeguard Cooper got to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She was able to bring them back to the surface and get them back to shore where we were able to render aid. They did take on a little water. And so our paramedics transported them to the children's memorial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's just one example. I mean, we had a a choking infant. Alamitos Beach for many of the community that goes down there on the sand, it wasn't a water rescue, but our go render aid delivering and making sure that they had a pattern airway by the time that paramedics got there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They also were transported. And certainly our lifeguards have been involved throughout the year, not just in lifeguard rescue efforts. They've supported the pandemic by staffing many of the clinics, the testing sites, and they plan to return to that line of work once our summer season is over, if needed by the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they certainly do a lot more than than than just the rescue work. They're an incredibly talented team, and the fire department's extremely proud of all of their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thank you for that. I mean, I will say that one of the silver linings that we've seen with COVID and I've actually seen the evolution over the last six years, and I certainly hear from the residents in our parking impacted areas, the beaches have gotten a lot more activated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our water, our parks along the water are just, you know, completely packed with people on the weekends and on holidays and now during COVID, even on beach days. And so I think there is a very important place for our lifeguards and our seasonal lifeguards in public safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, I mean, you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have the government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I really want to make sure that that budget is considered. And, Mr. Modi, I'm looking to you for some guidance. We can talk offline about how we can continue to restore that budget through FY 21.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And similarly, the junior guard program. I'm intimately involved with that program. I have a child in the program. I think it runs very smoothly and efficiently right now. And I'm very concerned that I've heard from a lot of parents in my community who are concerned about the change in operation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd like to see that staffing stay as is for the next year. Finally, to our prime time, thank you very much for our beach maintenance crew. Cory Forrester does an amazing job with his team, with the sand replenishment project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm very hopeful that the hydraulic system will will yield some environmentally friendly alternatives for the future, because having those trucks go back and forth on the beach every day is very detrimental to public health. So think and I hope that's something that public health department can also help support us with because it's definitely a health crisis'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we need to address in terms of environmental impact. So thank you very much and I appreciate the time. Mr. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Councilman Price Compliment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. And thank you everyone for the presentations. I will start with the Health Department. Very happy that we started with the Health Department on these presentations. Also, you know, the four years that we've been there, I've been a council member trying to get structural funds for the health department has been a top priority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know it hasn't been everyone's top priority, but I do agree with the mayor when we look at this pandemic and all the situations that we're dealing with. But this is a top priority department to help ensure the safety and care of our residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that, I love the presentation about how we would tackle some of the equity issues. Obviously, I think everyone's heard my questions that I asked last week about the Hart team. As the person that brought the heart team forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do know that the goal of that was to coordinate with the Health Department was to make sure that we were doing proactive outreach to our homeless population, but also that we were able to respond to 911 calls.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also know that we purchased new vehicles for that. A lot of resources were put into that. And I'd like to hear from the department how would the help how would the Health Department take this on? And really, I'd love to hear if there's a model that somewhere in between what the city manager is being proposed and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'working with what we already have, whether it's, you know, one paramedic with the heart team and somebody from the health department or is there an area in the middle that we can come up with? So with that, Kelly, I'll go ahead and leave it to you to answer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Council Member The the current proposed model for the Hart team would be one public health nurse to be able to respond to the medical the medical issues, the public health nurses. Also, we have had one that's been embedded with our with our with our homeless services division.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that that public health nurse has been able to, you know, engage with people at encampments as well as really been able to connect people to levels of service that we have otherwise not had the capacity to connect people to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we'd have one public health nurse and then one on one mental health, um, one mental health clinician who would join. So each team that would go out would have, we'd have someone that could focus on the physical health and the mental health, as well as partnering with existing outreach workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there would be two of those teams, they would be available across the city seven days a week to support the response. And so we would be working with 911 dispatch to determine what the potential is to support through that, as well as people calling at the mercy when they're seeing things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they would like a response.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is Tom. I do want to say that we have adjusted a little bit from the original what's in the budget book. We did just say in the beginning it was just going to be public health nurses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we looked at this further, we really wanted to bring that mental health component to it. And also with the outreach workers, the model is going to be from going about a five day a week coverage under the current model to about a seven day or to seven day a week coverage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would have seven day a week with those mental health and the nurse and the outreach workers and actually have a reduction in savings as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So am I to understand, you said you'd be working with 911 dispatch, so someone calls 911 and it's somebody that is struggling with their mental health that might be homeless or, you know, out in the neighborhood. Would we be able to send just the heart team or would PD have to go as well?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this case, we're focusing this team is focused on our homeless population. So if a call comes in, we you know, this is we're in early negotiation figuring out exactly how the calls come in. So we would we working with the with nine would dispatch to understand what are what the opportunities are for responding to these situations'",
        "'speaker_7': '. I know at this time that the her team often arrives and then the then ambulance or paramedics can return or turn back. I don't know if that's a possibility moving forward. It's something that I would need to work on with Chief Espino and the fire department to understand how that could work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, it's my understanding when we have women. Yeah, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have one man.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It was my understanding that our team worked really hard with the community to be able to get just one of the Hart teams to be able to respond to 911 calls. And so really, when I when I think about reduction in cost, it's making sure that we're not sending out a fire truck, hart team or a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'police car. And so I don't think that our health department, from the work that we've done, can respond to 911 calls. And so I hope that we can get that question very clearly answered. And if they can't respond to 911 calls, can Tom work with the health department and the fire department to try to find a middle'",
        "'speaker_1': 'area work, something that we can do, whether it's one person from the fire team, along with the with the rest of the staff, I'll come back up. And when I come back up, I'll I'll focus my questions at the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Supernova. Okay. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Well, I'll move right to the fire department so it doesn't feel left out. But I don't have any questions for Kelly Colletti or for Brant Dennis. But I would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like to quote both of them in my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the fire department. And first, I think Kelly Colby said we're effective, that it's vital to draw upon grants. And I would ask that the same logic be applied to the fire department and specifically the safer grant that we, you know, dig a little deeper on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there are waivers, if there are any exceptions made for COVID 19, that we could take a closer look at the grants or that particular grant. Also, I believe Grant Dennis used the phrase maximized revenue opportunities applied to PRM.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would also ask that the fire department look at that. If we can look at fee structures, fire inspection fees or whatnot, get a robust system in place of collecting those fees that the department generates. So we take the focus out of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Saving or cutting ourselves into prosperity. And look at revenue generation. The chief talked about core services and that that is a focus now that that we've done that we keep solid core services and not cutting into that. And Councilman Richardson made this statement, but we don't want to go backwards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't want to use rescue 12. We don't want to lose the equipment we've had restored. And I would echo that. And also, Chief, I want to ask you a question about the community service. And this is not I don't want your answer in terms of equity, which is how the system works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when we lost E 17, we noticed that Engine ten was going on. A lot of those calls and Engine ten response area, but engine 17 is response area in 90804, which happens to be the densest zip code in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is it fair to say that that without Engine 17 in place, you're taking Engine ten, which I believe is the busiest or the second busiest engine company in the city away from their service area? Is that is that a fair statement to me?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman. Yes, that's a fair statement. All of the units that surround 17 the area would become busier just for the loss of that engine. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in particular, I talked about Engine ten. I think Station ten has been on 14th and Peterson in the vice district since the 1930s, I believe, and it has been a very busy station for a long time, at least 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know of they've been number one and number two busiest in the city. And the concept that we would take that engine company out of that service area and this is something I'll probably bring up under item 14.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think the irony isn't lost in anyone where we have a robust fire diversity program that we should be very proud of. But to lose core services to the black community or communities of color, that's just an irony I don't want to experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate your time. Great reports all around. I do have one final question for Prime and this probably goes to Steve Scott. On his watch, I was just told that we had funds that went to the municipal bands this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you don't have to respond right now. But if we could just look into those that funding and whether because we haven't had concepts of some of that money can can come back. All right. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you, Councilman Stefano, councilwoman and dance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You miss me or thank you very much for all that great information to everyone. I want to echo to the comments that all of my colleagues have been making, as far as you know. Well, let me start off with with Health and Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First of all, I think that it needs to be stated again that our health department really stepped up to the plate and during this raid radically transformed themselves into the operations and capacity in the face of COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've been doing an excellent job. And for that, you know, I think, you know, Kelly, you've been you and your team have really been doing a tremendous job. I also wanted to thank your team, you know, because I know that everybody over there has been working really hard on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Question. I was wondering if there's any way that staff might be able to comment on the impacts of the 2021 proposed budget in the expected. Is expected to have on its city's language access program and whether we can expect services to service levels to change as a result of this New Year's budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember. The the language access program has been really tapped through the COVID response. So at the beginning of last year, there was $80,000 aligned for interpretation and interpretation and translation support. We have quickly gone through that through COVID, and it's being sort of filled utilizing additional CARES Act funding and others for this upcoming year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is a proposed $160,000 for language access response, which is double the double the amount of previous years. And so it will expand capacity and ability to respond as long as the COVID response and others continue. There will be a large demand in our attempt to get messaging out to all of our communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. Thank you. I think that that's very important because Long Beach is rich in diversity and we need to make sure that everyone's informed. So thank you for that, Kelly. In regards to our fire fire department, I also wanted to thank Chief Espinoza for his report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just would like to add a follow up. Question in regards to the the junior lifeguards, I know that as Councilmember Price is also concerned about them. I am, too. You know, I think it's a program that really, really helps out our youth and really to some really takes them out of their community and gives them'",
        "'speaker_1': ', you know, the expertize to maybe make a choice in in becoming, you know. Maybe life guards in the future or just the experience that they get that makes them be such a better such a better person. So. You know, I was a little concerned about the possibility that that, you know, as proposed budget might be cut.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I you know, I'm I'm just curious to see if, you know, if we have. I guess my thing is that I really want to see that program remain, and I think that it's very important for our youth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I hope that we can take a look at it again and really consider our youth that are benefiting from this program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have one minute, Mrs.. In there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to make sure that also, you know, that when we're dealing with the distribution of the of the budget during these times, that we really focus on equity and see these changes through an equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the Parks and Recreation. Thank you so much, Director Dennis, that you just came on and already you have this big task. So thank you for that great presentation. And I would just like to add, you know, now that we have COVID happening and you know, there's a lot of budget cuts going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to see if if there was going to be still funding to move forward with the Drake Travis Greenbelt project that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sunday as your time is up. You can keep it like that. Yes. Councilman manga.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I had an additional question. Someone brought up the life saving measures that were happening on our beaches and the heroic save that our paramedics and our lifeguards did. We appreciate that very much. There's some studies out there related to transporting drowning victims and cardiac patients, and the success rates can be improved with mechanical CPR devices'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I know that we have a study coming to look at the efficiencies within our department, but when we come up with any of those potential efficiencies, I think it also important for us to consider the national standards and how they're changing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If mechanical CPR devices are saving more lives, then that's something we might want to consider. And if we cannot afford mechanical CPR devices at this time. Other agencies in Arizona have decided to just not transport when CPR is in process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I would just ask that we look at those as a part of our overall picture, because those kind of one time investments are expensive but worthwhile when they save lives. So thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'll try to finish up the conversation about the party team. I was just informed that I also received a letter from the DLP and Black Lives Matter around supporting keeping our Hart teams in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's not so much like is it a firefighter, is it a health department person, but it's that we have somebody else that can respond. And I'm one one calls that's not a police officer. It's not one of the calls that a police officer needs to respond to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just want to make sure that I spoke to that. On that point. I said that I had some questions for, you know, and so I wanted to ask. I know that this moment that we're in right now calls for a lot of structural changes, not only to the city budget because of COVID, but also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our police budget. And I looked through some of those changes and I was curious. I know that there's a study that's being proposed around our billing and everything, which I completely support. And I think any studies that we haven't been able to do in the last several years should be a priority to make sure that our fire'",
        "'speaker_1': 'department is getting up to speed with all the technological advances that we are asking of our other departments, including FIRE and including PD. But I did want to ask, I know in the police department there were several positions that were shifted to civilian positions, and I'm not an expert on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just curious, outside of the reduction of the 10% reduction for our lifeguards that was mentioned, are there other areas that I know this budget's moved quickly, but are there other areas that you can tell us you might be looking into to identify some other cuts?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. There are other areas that we have looked at civilian housing and unfortunately, many of the positions that we have that are not on the floor, as it were, say, like our fleet captain, that's that's a fleet sworn captain that also has all of the specifications for our apparatus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He was a former fire engineer. A lot of the different aspects that we would require of that position. And so we will continue to look at that. As I said, we will do a deep dove on the fire department in general and see if we can come up with some better efficiencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, I definitely support the diversity work. I know that that's something that you've heard deeply about and this council has led on a lot. Again, just because I am now getting community letters around this hard time, I really hope that maybe in the memo that comes from this meeting that we can explore what that might look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'like, whether instead of housing and one department that having it as a partnership with the two. And so if that was it for your department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If I can just follow up quickly just to point the the recent pandemic highlighted the effect, the effect of having sworn personnel in different positions, in administrative positions at certain points. During the beginning of this in March, we had upwards of 60 personnel beyond what we had on the floor, staffing our engines and trucks and paramedic rescues'",
        "'speaker_8': ', the ability to go from an administrative position and jump right over into a sworn position backfilling that is huge for us as far as surge capacity. And as you know, we're getting into fire season. We just had a strike team out with 22 personnel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Fortunately, they're all back safely, but they were back for potentially three or 4 hours before we were surveyed. Again, we have not gone back out, but I do believe we're going to have a very busy season. And so it does help us provide the best coverage possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand. Thank you for that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you have one minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One minute. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One minute, Mrs. Barrett.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Parks Rec and Marine. Welcome to the team. I think it's great. I guess my my main point on this is recognizing that both this department and the Health Department lead on efforts with our youth and our senior department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is more of a comment for for Mr. Modica. I know that we continue to talk about how we have these things work together, and I'm wondering if there's efficiencies and ways to make sure that we're fully supporting both of those populations by working with these departments collaboratively.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure which deputy city manager is in charge of both of these departments, but I think it would be great if it was the same person so that we have coordination there. I would love to hear about the opportunity of moving our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Park Rangers back to the park stalking Marine team. And so I would love to to talk about that offline and also hopefully see some comments on that in the memo that will come forward. So with that, I think you guys are really play.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Country mums and dads.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just wanted to go back to that question in regards to our Jake Chavis Green Belt project that we're working on. You know, just wanted to see how the budget might be affected on that, if at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's probably for director Dennis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Council member. That's a good question. So I know we're going to be when we welcome Meredith back to our team, putting in high gear for grant pursuits. I think there's lots of opportunities realizing what the vision is to expand Derek Chavez to become a more valuable community asset.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's our eye on the prize, but our hard work will be seeking out, you know, through research and then making a compelling case to bring grant funding. And also, you know, we're working to have a more robust relationship with partners of Parks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think they can be a real key player in helping attract funding to help accomplish that project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and also, you know, I just want to also share my thoughts on, you know, the heart, you know, program that we have through fire. I know that when I first learned about it a year ago that I was super excited to have this program helping our homeless community here in Long Beach, our homeless neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But so I, I really hope that we can find something in between what is being proposed right now and what what is currently in effect right now. So thank you very much. I think that's a very.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very important program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You've seen this so many, ranga.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I really didn't get to finish last time in my speech. I didn't get to address Parks Recreation. But just to finish it with fire, the $200,000 has been set aside for a comprehensive study of the fire services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has there been a plan yet in terms of what that study is going to conduct in regards to what aspects of revenue generation or possibilities we're going to look for in that study?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Councilman. To date, I don't believe there has been any communications with city management as far as the actual actual that are going to be coming out in conversations have been told that we are going to put together a team that will identify those things to be brought up in the report, and then it will go out'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to an RFP and will have a an agency come and take a look at the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of your and I can speak to that a little bit as well. So we have a history of doing these types of reviews from time to time. So we would put together an internal study team and honestly we'd be looking at everything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this would be looking at cost savings, would be looking at future cuts that we would have to make. As the chief mentioned, we have a $1.9 million structural cut in the budget that needs to be identified. And then we still have reductions coming up, about $75 million over the next three years that we need to identify'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And so we'd be looking at cost cutting, we'd be looking at revenue generation, we're looking at efficiencies. We could be looking at Tidelands as well, would be a pretty comprehensive review and that would form the basis of the recommendations back to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When can we expect to see that contract come? The City Council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's in the budget. So if you approved the budget, we would move forward. We can start a little bit in advance so that we can get going and then we would do the RFP. And if it's, you know, at the 200,000 level that normally comes to the council, unless there are we get three bids and then'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we would get started in this fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I'm looking forward to that. In Parks and Recreation. First of all, I did have a meeting today with Mr. Geithner, so we're very productive. Thank you. And welcome to Long Beach. You can do some great things here with very impressed with some of the ideas you have, especially as they relate to youth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the budget that we have here. I see that we have one time for the SAFE program. I'd like to see eventually that there's a program that I would like to see institutionalized and provided with structural funding that that program going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's it's proven its mettle and I think it deserves some structural funding to keep it going year in and year out. And that is my my comment on that. Also on page 57 of the budget book, there are some comments here made about I'm sorry, not 57, 59 where we have an increase but due to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'revenue. Q For parking, increase budgetary revenues for new sports by increasing fees and then an increase in budgetary revenues or the entry into account for outlays. But there are parentheses as being identified as being cuts. So I'm not understanding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you explain that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. The way that we show those in the budget book is if it is a negative, it actually helps the the issue. So by raising revenue, you actually reduce your deficit. So think of that as a deficit reduction measure which cuts into the $30 million deficit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why it's a negative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you for the clarification. That's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Coming from you in a courtroom on mango place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just wanted to say two things. The first one is that under no circumstances will I or the residents that I've spoken with be supportive of allowing armed park rangers to report through a command structure that does not undergo a eight 32.1 training.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no reason why we should get ourselves into the issues of the eighties and nineties, where we had armed park rangers firing at fleeing vehicles and other escalation of forces. Escalation of use of force that were completely inappropriate, including but not limited to a 16 year old who was held at gunpoint on the roof of his'",
        "'speaker_1': 'car for eating ice cream at Hartwell Park. Those issues happened when there was not proper training in place and proper supervision from those who are trained in the same command structure. So if this city would like to consider transferring the Parks and Rec rangers out of police, I would also highly recommend them not being PC 32 certified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and carrying weapons. So if you carry a lethal weapon, I strongly feel as the only person on this council who's probably gone through the PC 32 training, Susie may have some of it, but I think I'm the only one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That escalation of force needs to be supervised by a person who's gone through escalation of force training. We've had too many incidents in the past that were completely inappropriate that I think that we could recall before we get into that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that would be my first statement. That was one of the main initiatives that I worked really hard with a lot of our community members, people. The park rangers are deployed at Eldorado Park. They often serve other parks, all in the fifth District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the escalation of force issues were always brought to my attention, and they were completely inappropriate. So we have not had nearly the number of issues since then. Before they reported to the police department, we would have reports that the park ranger vehicles were driving around in Los Alamitos and other crazy things that would come in as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'complaints to my office. And all of that has been handled very professionally by the police department. So I just can't state enough my complete frustration with the potential. Second, Chief Espino, I'm interested because I actually don't know how our fire department works in this range, but when we do plan on wildfires, are we getting reimbursed back on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'overtime by our federal FEMA funding? And if so, does that mean that the more often we deploy, the more revenue we bring in? But my guess would be that it would be budget neutral. Would you be able to explain that to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'David? Please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can't hear. Chief Espino Can anyone else?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'David Honey, who's coming up?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mike Okay. I heard something. I just wasn't sure if it was an answer. R Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Councilwoman Mongeau Thanks for the question. So when we're deployed on a wildland event, the, the positions are covered, the positions that are out that we're reimbursed by the state for the backfill for them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through state FEMA. Correct. But does that put us on any kind of double overtime or do they reimburse at overtime or do they only reimburse the level of deployment of the individual who's being called in? Is it net neutral?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess my question and this isn't we know, is it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. This is David Huntington, manager of administration. So, yeah, so we're reimbursed we were reimbursed for each position that that is out on the deployment. We also recover an administrative fee of about 10% administrative overhead. So it's it's neutral.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But for the the administrative costs, we get back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where it actually is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have one minute, council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One minute. Thank you. Bye. From there, I hope not to use the whole thing. So we are reimbursed at operation side at net neutral. But theoretically, the more deployments we go on, the greater percentage of our administrative costs are covered by the state funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. Each each deployment results in 10% administrative overhead, recovering those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Costs. So do we. How many fires do we budget to go out on per year?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Each year we only budgeted a very small amount of overtime. We we budget $175,000 just kind of as a placeholder. And then when we we usually have well over $1,000,000 in reimbursement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But not one of the reasons why the fire budget always has a surplus at the end, would it be more appropriate during this exercise to consider budgeting that at actuals? I think that's actually something that. It has been brought to my attention before and I think we've discussed is there a reason it has not been executed?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we budget the 175,000 conservatively because we could have a year where there is a very low number of deployments. And in that case, if we had $1,000,000 and called back over time budget, we wouldn't, you know, we'd be well over budgeted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we budget that very conservatively at the beginning of each fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So extremely able to tell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me what your time is up to you can keep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope that we can find out what the five year average of deployment is it potentially budget at that level? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Congresswoman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your vice mayor. I want to just thank all of the department heads for our great presentation and my colleagues for for asking a lot of very good questions and making great points here. There were a couple of things I wanted to just just just weigh in on and speak to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number one is Parks, Recreation, Marine, the Be Safe program. One of my colleagues mentioned that it should be funded structurally, and I tend to agree and I believe that that is the direction we should be going in for many years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, we have funded Be Safe We Safe Program, which is a summer activity program in our parks for the last seven years, I believe, through one time funding. And so it is a program that that we have depended on that we know works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I would agree that that should be a structural consideration. Also, I'm very, very elated to see that that, you know, the recommendation to to add senior activities at the Expo into the structural funding, a little bit about the history.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This started about six years ago, five years ago. My office funded it and saw grant funds to get senior programing going. We started at two days a week now where three days a week we have, you know, a few hundred seniors who participate regularly in these programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so these are small budget impacts that go a long way with our residents. It's really they're both programs that are investment in human room and infrastructure in a lot of ways. And lastly, I wanted to touch on the heart team because I think, you know, certainly this concept of using nurses and mental health professionals as part'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the outreach component. Heart has been discussed over the last couple of years. I know, and I think our firefighters have done a great job. I'm curious to know how those firefighters chief are going to be utilized because there's a there's a lot of good training these individuals have and there's a lot of knowledge that they have'",
        "'speaker_3': '. You know, will they continue to be engaged and involved in in our homeless services outreach in their their roles as paramedics, number one? I guess it's a question for the chief.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilman. So those four paramedics will be reassigned back to vacancies on current rescues. They will still be used to deliver mental health awareness training to the department and also to the recruits that we have going through the academy as their role with the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're still working through that. As stated, we're going to work with Health and Human Services on a go forward. But right now there is nothing concrete as far as their continued assistance with homelessness in particular.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I would just say I would hope so. And it's encouraging that they're going to be utilized to help train others and obviously share the knowledge and experience that they have with other firefighters. But I would like to see that extended to other city staff as well, because I think there's an opportunity here to go beyond the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'scope that we're looking at. You know, we have we have homeless in our libraries. We have homeless in our and our parks. We have, you know, those experiencing homelessness along the railroad tracks and other areas across the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have city employees who are engaging or could engage if comes 121 minutes. So I won't need it. They had the proper training, and so that's just my statement on that. Obviously, this is a tough budget and we have to look at creative ways to continue to provide the great services that we do as a city'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So thank you. Those are my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Council awesome council person.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vice Mayor. I really appreciate it. I am cued up one more time because I. You know, I'm kind of in budget for AIDS and and then I'm looking at some of the reconciliation work. And just I wanted to reiterate one more time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was brought to my attention that this was something that came out of the reconciliation process as well. And so I wanted to say one more time that there's other models, I think it might be called if needs or something like that, that we might need to start from the ground up to build what this response team'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is, and not only for our homeless, but for people that are struggling with mental health. And so I hope that in the report that comes back from this that we would be able to look and see exactly how many stock are we talking total that would be doing mental health outreach, whether that's quality of life, the fire'",
        "'speaker_1': 'department or our health department, and that there's real coordination. I understand that we used to have better coordination between our quality of life officers and our fire department and our health team. And that's really going to be where we save the most resources and money and are able to train more people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I wanted to mention that I also wanted to mention the rental housing division that was brought up by the people's budget. I know that it's a lot of our resources that have been asked for, but it's something that I wholeheartedly support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also wanted to mention the language access proposal by the mayor to make that structural. We've been having that conversation for a very long time. I think one of the important parts of this structurally funding it is also looking at when we get grants and different departments, making sure that we have a point person that's able to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'identify what percentage of those grants might be able to be used for language access because somebody said it before me. But we definitely have had a big surge in the need for language access in the middle of this COVID moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so wanted to make sure that I brought those up before we went to public comment. So oh, in the last, the last thing, that's where I could have Councilmember Mongeau mentioned the officers in the parks. You guys probably guessed, but I'm not really a fan of guns, so I definitely would love to understand what it would'",
        "'speaker_1': 'take to be able to have park rangers without guns. Councilmember Price And I've been working really hard on trying to secure Bixby Park, and I know that we tend to disagree on maybe what that looks like, but we came to agreement on a park ranger.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did not know at the time that park rangers were housed in our police department. I thought they were housed in our parks department. So I am looking for some kind of understanding about what changes can happen to make sure that we have some oversight and somebody that's in our parks consistently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm almost done. So if you're about, say, have one more minute, you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Got.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And one example today is that I drove by Bixby Park and I saw two of our police SUVs driving through the grass on parcel three where people were laying out and picnicking and throwing Frisbees. And it just is a type of presence that doesn't make me comfortable as a as a white woman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think in this moment, it doesn't make people of color or black communities comfortable either. And when we're having these budget conversations, we have to take real life examples about what makes what makes people uncomfortable and how can we make it better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think of park ranger is what we need. I would prefer to be a park ranger that's in our Parks Department. So that is all I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Vice Mayor. So. I do support park rangers in the park as well. I do not have any issue with them being armed. To me, it's more how they're dressed, not necessarily the safety tools that they have available, assuming that they've received proper training.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Councilman Mungo stated, that they're working in a department that specializes in training and use of force and so that they're trained properly. But I think whatever we can do to ensure safety in the park and having a presence by someone who can actually assess a threat and have the means to protect themselves and others if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'necessary, is important. But I think we both do agree that park rangers are necessary in Bixby Park and any sort of ongoing presence in Bixby Park I think would be welcomed, armed or otherwise. But I actually really like the program that's taking place right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was at the park with my family last week, the week before, and soon after the commander implemented our our current model. And I thought it was really pleasant. So I didn't have the same experience that Councilwoman Pierce did, not to negate her experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I didn't have the same experience. But anyway, what I wanted to ask about was the health department. There are a couple of programs that I have brought to council as agenda items that appear to have maybe fallen off of the radar because of COVID and other issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I was hoping that. Ms. Collopy, could you provide us an update on the real time bed app that we that you and I have met about and had a presentation at Council on and also the Homeless Work Program I know that started in the Health Department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure where it landed, but those are two programs that I think really speak to the homelessness and equity issues and do service the entire city, which of course we want every city department to do. So if you could speak to those, I'd really appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Councilmember So the Homeless Bud app was aligned with the Sturt program, which is the start up and residence program that was intended to begin, I believe, in January and moving forward and I can find out where that progress is at this time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we did select a vendor to start to build out that app as part of the start up and residence program. The intent was to have that done, I believe, in June, but with COVID and other things have been delayed and I will follow up and get that back to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In terms of the work program, that program has started. It's working with workforce development. And so while it's it doesn't currently have an opportunity where people are being, you know, meeting at a certain location and going out in teams.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe that there are connections to individual trainings and other work opportunities. So that is currently being run through the workforce services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Got it. Are we intending to use any of the funding for the homeless initiatives, the structural funding that we're getting to support any of these creative solutions that have been suggested through Council for Pilot Programs?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At this time, none of the structural funding is outlined is focused on that. So the structural funding focuses more on services. All the remaining funding that we have is one time either the purchase of buildings and infrastructure or running different programs such as the Safe Parking Program, that's that's already been implemented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we can look at funds to identify, to determine if there are some available to at least build off of the kick off point for the for the better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So for the better app, I must have been mistaken. But I thought we were. We met. I believe you and Mr. Murdoch and I met in my field office, and I thought that there was funding there for the pilot, the six month pilot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. In that case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. And that's going on right now. So through the Sturt program, that is the funding for the creation and the pilot. And then the question became, what would be the ability to extend that? So I will get back and follow up on that with the progress through the start up in residence program to determine where that currently'",
        "'speaker_7': 'exists and the ability to move it forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any grant funds or any CARES ACT funding that could be utilized to pursue creative homeless strategies?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For. Right now, the CARES Act funding is when millions of dollars of that is going to fund our response to COVID in the congregate shelters and all those. The other million is if we're currently looking at the utilization of that, to maybe support a project HOMEKEY.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So permanent housing. So that would be the CARES Act funding piece around homelessness. I think that there are other opportunities to to look at some alternate pieces, but most of the things that are ongoing funding, the structural funding are very much focused specifically on on programs such as outreach prevention, rapid rehousing, transitional housing, connection to permanent supportive'",
        "'speaker_7': 'housing. But we can certainly dig in and look and look at those resources right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Price for women.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm done. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, fine. Thank you. With that said, I sense that since we're talking about park rangers, I'd like to know how many do we have and where are they? Station. Could anyone answer that question? About the park rangers. I we have and we're at the station.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have three park rangers. They are stationed in Hartwell Park and in Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Tom. So since that said, you know, we're talking about equity. I would really like a discussion off time with Tom and read about going to this with that. Thank you guys very much. And now we're going to we want to button public comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our first speaker is Adrina Redman. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Somehow I knew that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was going to be the first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One. I don't know how that is going to happen. And then we thank you all for giving me this time. Long Beach thrives in part because of this black residents. And yet more and more black residents are finding Long Beach inhospitable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It costs too much to live here. Communities are harassed, abuse, overpoliced and killed by HLB. PD services aren't easily known or accessible. For example, the Health and Human Services has a program targeting black infant health. But my understanding is that it has little recognition in the community as it is one of many programs that need greater funding'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for staff and programing. The Black Infant Health Program deserves at least the funding for promotion similar to, if not greater than that allocated to LAPD for their public promotions. With all evidence from city funded studies like the 2019 equity growth profile is shamefully to COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And more so, the street uprisings related to the murder of George Floyd. To move the mayor and council to acknowledge that racism is a public health crisis. With the call to defund lbe PD. My organization, Black Lives Matters, Long Beach and others, I was shocked to learn that our health department is primarily a grant supported agency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Shameful that the city, which touts its diversity and is fortunate enough to have a Health and Human Services Department, is not providing the department with the permanent funding it needs. There is something deeply, deeply wrong with this picture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, our city elected leaders as city mayors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Caitlin Bellis. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Caitlin Bellis and I'm a resident of District two and a volunteer with Sanctuary Long Beach. I'm an immigration attorney with UCI Immigrant Rights Clinic, and I have been doing the paint removal defense in Southern California for five years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I urge you to defund LBP and instead adopt the people's budget. I urge you to invest in care for our community. And I especially urge you to make the Long Beach Trust Fund a part of the city budget for as long as it exists, and to fund it this year at $400,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Justice Center so far helped 21 Long Beach families, but I know there are many more who have not gotten the help they need and have been torn apart. The worst part of my job has always been choosing clients.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are so many more people in Adelanto than I and the other service providers can help, and I know that having a lawyer often makes the difference between winning and losing. Between exile and family. And sometimes between life and death.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm haunted by the hundreds of people I had to say no to. I've seen people with winnable cases lose because they could not gather evidence to prove their cases or present the necessary legal arguments. I've seen others give up their cases out of despair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Both are being in immigration, jail and facing the system alone, especially now. Detention can be a death sentence. Social distancing is not possible in Adelanto. Even before the pandemic, we heard many reports of the medical staff there telling people with serious medical and medical conditions just to drink more water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rather than providing proper care. Now for an even more horrifying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Report and at the same time, the pandemic has made detention deadly. It has made it even harder for our community to pay for private attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Jodi. And during your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello, counsel. My name is Jordan. I'm a Long Beach renter and resident. I wanted to say that Councilmember Richardson's idea of a centralized housing department is great, but I'm going to address the elephant in the room that the budget you're talking about now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The three departments are critical to the city, but not very important for the budget. And the reason I say that is that the the shadow of LAPD's budget is blocking out all three departments I just heard from that are doing critical stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'LAPD is barely getting a cut this year. They're still getting most of the general fund and other departments are struggling to provide essential services. So I've heard several councilmembers, including councilors Miguel Price and Super talk about various technocratic fixes, minor tweaks to try to keep thing services going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I've got really great news for everyone. There is a $240 Million BPD budget that needs to be cut as a grant from BLM said. That's been a clear community ask. You're going to talk about that and reconciliation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But honestly, you're just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic if you don't cut. Considering the fact that you have a $30 million budget shortfall, that would only require a 12% cut to his budget to fill. So, for example, you know, Councilmember Pearce said, you know, we need more money for our teams.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That has to come out of Lupita's budget. So let me remind you, either you cut LAPD or you just let the city flounder and become more livable for working class people. My time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is katie traversal. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. This is Katie Silver. So on behalf of the Very Institute of Justice. On behalf of the Institute, I urge the City of Long Beach to allocate funding at the level of 400,000 for the Long Beach Justice Fund and to ensure that it is a permanent reoccurring part of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have to applaud the city of Long Beach for leadership in providing legal defense to immigrants facing deportation through a model where everyone facing deportation is entitled to legal representation through a universal representation model. This means.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Regardless of income, race.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'National origin or history with the criminal justice system. Long Beach is the first and only city in Los Angeles County that provides legal defense to immigrants through this model. We are proud that Long Beach is one of 18 jurisdictions, a safe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Network nationwide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'During the first year of the fund. It enabled the representation of 21 Long Beach community members. But this is to the entire family, into the community. For example, those helped by the fund so far are deeply entrenched members of the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They live in the United States, on average for 14 years. Over a third of the clients helped by the fund are parents to 21 children under the age of 18. Over a third of the clients are the breadwinners for the family.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, council members. My condolences to Mayor Garcia on the tragic loss of both of his parents. I am truly sorry for your loss. A concerned District two resident for years has received over 45% of the city's budget funding, leaving less than 5% of the city's health department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mayor and the city council have admitted that racism is a public health crisis, yet funding has been severely low for the health department. According to the Center for Disease Control. Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from pregnancy related cause related causes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'White women are black. Infant mortality program in Long Beach is severely underfunded and have no marketing budget, unlike the million dollar spent by the police and their PR. So even in our own city, black women are not aware of these services and are severely harmed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In local hospitals, they die at an extremely high rate. 2003 to 28, an average of ten babies died annually. This is inexcusable and a direct link to systemic and institutional racism experienced by black women. So therefore, city council members, I encourage you to double the budget allocation for the Health Department by defunding the police and reinvesting LBP'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. This is Myles Hensley. I'm calling to call on city council to defund APD. The proposed defunding of 1.7% for fiscal year 2021 is despicable. It is not enough. LAPD currently brutalizes and kills black and black and other community members in Long Beach, which is unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The proposed $3.2 million budget for racial equity and reconciliation reconciliation initiatives. That's only 1% of the police budget, which really shows how much stock you've put in to addressing the systemic inequality and brutalization of the black community as an example of what we can do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Instead, with the police budget, a 25% cut in the police budget would fund 800 new units of affordable housing per year by leveraging state, federal and private dollars.

        "'speaker_0': 'Furthermore, a 10% cut in the police budget reallocated to the Health Department would fund 300 public health nurses, housing specialists and outreach workers.

        "'speaker_5': 'In theory, they work for the people. With almost half of the general fund paid for by people's taxes and fines, going to DPD with money flowing upwards and then back and forth between those in power. It is helpful to understand the relationship between the public and the police as transactional.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The question of why some the police behooves is to consider what is produced by funding the police. What do the people get in return? In light of today's presentations by the Health and Parks Departments, I wanted to pose the question why from the police department to the point of OVERBLOW over the Health and Parks Department?'",

I'm here today to express our concern over the proposed elimination of the junior lifeguard coordinator and 10% of our ocean lifeguards. A clear safety risk that would result from these cuts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what the council may not know is how these cuts would affect the progress we've made in increasing the diversity of our ranks. We've been striving to establish a workforce that reflects the Long Beach community by increasing recruitment and accessibility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We identified two main obstacles to the program passing the swim, tryout and transportation to the beach. As always, we created a tryout prep class at Rio and Jordan and developed a partnership with Long Beach Unified to provide free access to both the prep class and the program, as well as transportation to the beach.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Clearly, the police departments under the police department understands what we're saying when we're saying to divest because they move the crossing guards into public works. Why are crossing guards even under the police? Right. The quality of life work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we just got rid of five of those quality of life, folks gave them to the health department, who are the ones just now, as Kelly mentioned, struggling, you know, not struggling, but preparing to figure out how to manage that at work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Even if you got rid of five, that saved nearly $1,000,000, you can hire 5 to 10 more for the same cost and be able to maximize tending to the needs in the community. You can cut six officers from a narcotic field teams that are just focusing on kids and street drug sales.'",

We recognize the need for the city to offer great compassion, empathy and humility as part of the reconciliation process.'",

In acknowledging this, we thought that no voice could speak with more expertize than our own city health officer, Dr. Anissa Davis.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'These factors and many other factors such as trauma, poverty and air quality affect how long we live. If you drive from one side of Long Beach to the other, there's about a 17.5 year life expectancy difference between our neighborhoods.'",

But unless we name our history as the root cause, the solutions will always be focused on individual change. Yet we know that the real change needs to happen at a systemic level because of the way that history has shaped the role of race in our country'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and in Long Beach. A key piece of the framework is to acknowledge the existence and longstanding impacts of systemic racism in America and in Long Beach. We've done this through the development of a historical timeline of racial inequities in Long Beach, which allows us to understand the root causes of inequities, learn from our past and together build'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a more equitable community. The resolution declaring racism as a public health crisis. Naming things like life expectancy, infant and maternal mortality. High blood pressure, diabetes. And how all of these things are symptoms of racism that are experienced at higher rates by black people and people of color.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'After these steps of acknowledging systemic racism, we moved into listening. Once we received the counsel requests on the ninth to prepare the report, four days later, we scheduled our first series of listening sessions. During this process, city leadership, including Tom Modica, Linda Tatum, Kevin Jackson, Kelly Colby, myself, members of the equity team and other city leadership listened'",

These sessions were hard on all of us, city staff and community members alike, as most people who spoke shared personal encounters and stories of violence, mistrust and frustration across a spectrum of personal encounters with the systems at large.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We were listening clearly throughout the process and made adjustments along the way. After the first session, we started working with third party facilitators who are not city employees to facilitate the sessions. Because of the COVID 19 pandemic, we conducted the listening sessions virtually via Zoom in a matter of two and a half weeks.'",

We also engaged city staff in the process through two listening sessions and a survey engaging a total of 503 staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Community outreach to underrepresented voices is a challenge in normal circumstances and even harder in a pandemic where physical connection is prohibited, and even more so given our short time frame. We tried to get creative in reaching out beyond the city's normal social media and website reach.'",

We also had the Housing Authority inspectors distribute fliers at barbershops and beauty supply stores when they were open, and our health team distributed fliers at COVID testing sites.'",

Throughout our listening sessions, we clearly heard the need to center black voices. However, we also heard from non-black community members that they felt the process was not inclusive of their experience of racism and inequity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'During some of the drafts, we moved away from the term black to communities of color in an effort to be inclusive as possible. This resulted in backlash and hurt from the stakeholders for what they perceive was erasing the black experience from the report, which was certainly not our goal or intent.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The second strategy Create measurement tools to understand depth and scale of racism to inform and evaluate change. This requires deeper analysis of our city's social, economic, health, safety, and other data to understand the impacts of structural racism. To identify wellness indicators.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to create measurement tools. To be utilized. To evaluate response and demonstrate progress. The third strategy is to center voices most impacted by systemic racism in policies, practices and programs. A core principle of equity is ensuring the voices of those most impacted are centered in policy practices and program design and implementation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The focus here is engaging voices that are not otherwise been engaged, utilizing innovative engagement tools and creating opportunities for authentic dialogs. Four Strategies Build Organizational Capacity to support anti-racist reform with removing the Office of Equity and Language Access Program to the city manager's office to highlight the importance of their work and further support its capacity to retraining'",
        "'speaker_7': ', engagement and utilization of the equity tool kit, as well as building a cohort of equity champions across city departments to ensure equity is embedded across the city.

The actions outlined in this goal provide an opportunity to systemically look at the social and economic barriers which perpetuate violence in communities and begin to address them.

We also redesigned the heart to model, as previously discussed from firefighters to nurses and social workers, build social work program at libraries.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'partner violence, community bar, the substance abuse and natural disasters cannot be addressed more safely with greater impact and more cost effectively and efficiently with community organizations. Not only does Law Beach realize it needs radical change. Our state has made it definitive that there is a severe problem that must be rectified.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The numbers have already been crushed. Long Beach, if they implement cahoots in Long Beach, can save over $60 million every year of their budget. Other cities that share a similar crime and mental health demographics like New York, San Francisco and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Indianapolis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have already begun establishing cahoots base programs in their cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next, speakers will need a diploma. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you and good evening, honorable mayor, vice mayor and fellow members of City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight. Again, my name is Dr. Moore. I'm a proud resident of North Long Beach, a Mother Nature commissioner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I also participated in several of the discussions regarding the reconciliation program to address the racial inequalities that have been brought to light by the recent pandemic. The social and racial injustice. And the reconciliation initiative. The desired outcomes that I would like to see for the youth are more afterschool and summer programs as it relates to STEM'",
        "'speaker_5': 'science, technology, engineering and math. Exposure to these programs in these areas help to prepare our youth for for the careers of tomorrow. Tutoring and resources. Such programs that would be of assistance with helping with a proficiency requirement that lead to college preparedness, readiness and completion rates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These programs foster a college growing culture that is that is sustainable for all members of our community, most importantly, for those in underserved communities. Internship programs and trade programs such as workforce development and service programs. These programs provide job, career and readiness exploration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know that my concern for you, as well as other members outlined in the Reconciliation Racial Inequality Reference Reconciliation initiative as well as I ask that you take great care at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Kevin, Georgia. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. My name is Kevin Yeager, District four resident The recommendations from the Framework for Reconciliation are great, but they do not go nearly far enough. And that's because our city's true priorities are shown not by the number of different things we can say we did, but where we put our resources in the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These 3 million and investments only amount to about 1% of LAPD's budget. And again, we're here right now having this conversation in response to decades of police violence. LAPD continues to receive 44% of the general fund, 240 million, only 4 million less than last year's 244 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cutting APD 1.7% relative to last year is not nearly enough. The message from these conversations was to divest from police, invest in black communities. We can solve our entire budget shortfall and invest in critical new programs. By cutting LAPD's 240 million and cutting LAPD doesn't mean cutting public safety.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When thousands of renters are evicted in the coming months, LV PD won't keep us safe. LAPD officers can't keep us safe from COVID. They can't even wear their masks consistently. There won't be federal when federal agents show up trying to deport our community members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'LAPD will not be there to keep us safe. Please invest in real public safety by funding housing, immigration, defense, health, language access in accordance with the people's budget. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Kimathi. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city created a reconciliation process without community stakeholders, mainly to fit into the city's budget structure and process. This alone is a practice of white supremacy because it perpetuates centering of the dominant cultural practices. Nevertheless, there were listening sessions and town halls with over 1500 participants from our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mayor and a few council members have publicly admitted that, yes, racism is a public health crisis in Long Beach and black folks have been harmed for generations. However, the police, who are the main predators of harm to the black community aside from COVID, have never apologized for any harm throughout this reconciliation process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Teresa mentioned the painstaking stakeholders meeting that we had for 3 hours, trying to convince the staff and Tom Modica specifically that it wasn't ethical to alter the data that was collected during a reconciliation process that admitted harm done to black people in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yet black people were erased and the voice of the community demanded it be put back in. Hence the document you see today. It was really disappointing to see one of the council members post on social media that the word black is all over the document.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me say that was both rude and hurtful to see him belittle the work of the community who helped put the word black back into the document. That was an example of white supremacy practices from that council member.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Erasure of black people in documentation are physically driving them out of your neighborhoods or city is white supremacy. This process is not to point fingers at individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speakers maniac be. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to finish what Don said. You can't condemn racism and police violence across the country, but not do it once in the report. No police violence has been condemned tonight. And that is a problem because that is not reflective of the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The question is, what is reconciliation? It is a victim driven process. This is not victim driven. This is institutionalized racism right in the face of the people that you're claiming to be reconciling with. The fact that time you claim that you are data driven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what you said to me. And in the same conversation admitted that words were removed. Defined was nowhere in the report. Black was taken out eight times with the data is where those things came from. So you're a liar if you claim to be data driven, but you allowed that process to be changed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And only by us having hoopla and and anger and frustration did you change it. But this process, civilization, what is that? This is all just a crock because it's only going to be 1%. Racism is systematic and structural.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This report and this budget does not reflect a structural and systematic method of combating racism for black people at all. And there's no discussion of defunding and reinvesting police budget in a significant way. Then this is just a farce and it's not victim driven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the people that are guilty of perpetuating racism are trying to co-opt this process and make it sound nice with beautiful pictures on documents and nice, flowery words and reports. But no significant changes are being made if only 1% is coming out of the police budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Pastor Leon Wood. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I want to thank you, the mayor, for having me on the program. I would like to say that Long Beach has a lot of high and lows. Over the years, I've been coming here as a little boy for years, and I remember that it's always had some racial issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank Councilman Rex Richardson for his leadership in giving me an opportunity to speak about them and having others speak about this as a longtime member of the black community and faith communities. I know the history here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know the obstacles young black men face, and I know the needs of our communities. You can look and see that if a community has a really high education system, full employment, and people are treated well, you have less crime and you have less, less violence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously, we don't have those things because we have high crime and high violence are structural. Change will address the inequities black and brown households are burdened with. And we want to see the recommendations in this report to come to life that actually go in and make structural change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And every home that's suffering in the Long Beach community. I've been looking and success and challenges this summer. We had the Freedom School and we were able to to work with young schools virtually. And we really saw that what takes place when you really give some love and care for young people and try to help them move'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. My name is Patrick Swimmer and I'm here on behalf of the Long Beach Young Democrats. On June 10th, our organization took emergency action to support this framework and other policies to address the racial injustices within our city, such as defunding the police at least $40 million to 2017 levels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we appreciate that the council felt the urgency to act in time for the budget. However, something this crucial for the health and safety of the black community and our other communities of color requires a more thorough process and should not have been rushed to completion in less than two months, especially at the expense of the integrity'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the data you collected. The participants of the study were not representative of the communities for whom this framework was developed. Even still, among the community members who did participate, an overwhelming amount said that their number one priority was to defund LV PD.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But according to attachment and the executive summary of the budget, the police department moved only from $264 million last year to 260 million doubt this year. Rather than listening to the participants of this study and the countless community based organizations who have called for the same the police to remain essentially fully funded and only 3.2 million is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'allocated for the implementation of this reconciliation process. We support the purpose and goals of the reconciliation, but the implementation of this plan must be done in concert with the greater structural changes called for by the community, specifically defunding APD and reinvesting in our communities to a meaningful degree Black Lives Matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that should be reflected in our city budget and operations. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Max Norse. Your time starts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now. Hey, folks, good evening again. I just wanted to chime in and make sure that you know that we need more affordable housing in Long Beach if we're going to ensure to keep what black community we have left here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to implement the housing division where tenants can go and handle false accusations from landlords rather than face eviction and court fees there and having the record at Jeopardy! Which affects their ability to rent a new home or even stay in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We must continue to listen to black community voices and defund the police and fund the need. Black community voices and defund the police and fund the needs of the community in order to make sure we invest in the most marginalized.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Imagine if we created affordable housing units in District three and five people in those units would have longer life expectancies defined. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Rebecca Rose. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is insulting to see the city council vote to talk about talking about racism, reconciliation. We need answers yesterday. It feels like you guys think we're stupid. We aren't stupid. We're watching. We are busy. Like you are busy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are overwhelmed. Like you are overwhelmed. But the people of Long Beach actually care about those most affected by police brutality and institutional racism and all the other intersections that cause struggle and suffering within the capitalist system. If you aren't radical, then you aren't left.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So stop pretending. We we all know the Long Beach City Council are Republicans pretending to be liberal. You give the appearance of caring while you while we hold the burdens of your inaction. So come that. Come the outcome of the reconciliation guidelines is to divest from the police and invest in the community in terms of public health'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and education, especially in bipoc communities. This means a lot of police officers will likely lose their job, but if they are in the business of helping people, they can find work to help the community without the use of force.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can remove a uniform. You cannot remove your ethnicity. The jobs created from investing in the community. You will employ the people with an honest desire to protect and serve a kind that doesn't put others lives at risk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need you, the City Council, to expand your imagination beyond the current structures. Based on the current distribution of funding, it is clear that you take punishment more seriously than prevention because Opiates PD received about 44% of the general fund, while other departments that directly serve serve the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Next speakers, Ryan Ballard. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening and thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much for this opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I first want to say in this public forum that my family extends our sincerest condolences to our mayor and his family. But is with that same spirit in mind that I express.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My thoughts on tonight. That is the spirit of humanity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope that our elected officials will view this as an opportunity to right an historical wrong. Clearly, the community is hurt. Those who spoke before me spoke with such eloquence, and if I could, I would echo every one of their sentiments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We realize that this is not an endpoint, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is merely a start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But many in our community included, are wondering what's different now. We hope that we will really see tangible change, because for many of us, this is this is all too normal. The death of George Floyd and many, many others is typical.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what changed in this time?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're hoping.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That you will vote fully support what this initiative is intending to do, what we hope that it is intending to do, and that is to really abolish the racism that many of us have suffered, not only abroad, but here in the beautiful city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would hope that you would vote not only.'",

Leaders across the city work from a place of loss and life experiences that has positioned them to be the best equipped to lead the execution of the recommendations on the reconciliation plan. With that said, I urge the Health Department, Economic Development and other departments to invest in community organizations that work from'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The harms. We must go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Further. It was my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we create a Truth and Reconciliation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Commission, something to truly institutionalize equity going forward. These voices that you're hearing on the phone have.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Ours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To hearing from them.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Solidarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With the Black Lives Matter movement here, specifically.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In Long Beach, and our efforts to highlight and gain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Justice prefer to cast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Victim of white supremacy within our own city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our recommendations were sent to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In full.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Defund the police. It's simple the creation of neighborhood justice centers. We need true movement towards addressing centuries old issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'While this is not an impact that I. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our last speaker is Dave Shukla. Your time starts now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. Well, first of all, if I could correct suggestions, the impetus for bringing this item forward and through the chamber for a very amazing and heartfelt presentation, the better than expected. My name is Dave Shukla. I am the eldest grandson of Bashir on the group of five Shukla, whose name I do not invoke lightly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To do so is to claim one of the oldest familial traditions on this planet. Things like the transatlantic campaign, 400 years of racialized capitalism in America. These are relatively small things in the time, history and perspective of my people and my family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a lot with this reconciliation initiative that is a good starting point. Obviously, we've heard a lot about how it needs to be expanded. One Direction. We need a decade old program. We need to revisit this every two years by the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do this in person in two years. We need to start thinking about zero budgeting within two years and fiscal year 2322. We need to think a lot about our budget, obviously, but specifically for having the public safety budget come on the 18th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been working 18 hour days for two, three months. We have a much more important item for the city coming up the day of the action plan. Thank you. And that concludes public comment for this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Now we got a lot to come to mind and then councilman's comments and we'll have Councilman Richardson to speak and then we'll go through the glasses. Thanks, Vice Mayor. Just a few amendments that I have more comments I'll to back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I if I run out of time. So first, I want to acknowledge all of the comments from the public. I want to let people know this is not the city declaring that we have achieved reconciliation. This is the city acknowledging that we need to take steps with the goal of achieving reconciliation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It will not happen overnight. I'm not confused about that. I hope that you are not confused about that. This will that will require hard work, dedication and continuing to build and shape our city. Now, a few points here that I want to lift up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There have been a lot of issues tonight with interpretation. I want to start by just acknowledging that we need to correct the interpretation process, particularly if we're doing using remote process here. So I want to see that. I want to see a two from four and I'll put that in my motion, a two from four on how'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we can think about ways to improve the interpretation process. Secondly, I want to acknowledge the fact that racial equity acknowledges barriers across race. There's a lot of focus here on the black community. The community has demanded that we center this experience on the black community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I also acknowledge that there are significant barriers facing our Latino population and our combined population. And so I want it reflected in this motion for staff to go and engage directly with the Latino community and the Cambodian community and find out what process they'd like to do to make sure that this reconciliation process moving forward includes'",
        "'speaker_0': 'them more intentionally and specifically. I also would like to include as a as a as an amendment here that I'd like to see. I'd like to see some tangible change in in order to do that. We have to track, track and measure progress.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'd like to see benchmarks and reports on a six month basis. And I'd like to see see it recorded in disaggregated data by race and ethnicity. I want this reflected in my motion. I think that there needs to be some ongoing oversight to some of this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the recommendations within the framework talks about reimagining Human Relations Commission. I think now is the time for us to engage directly with a Human Relations Commission, to create an equity commission that can work hand-in-hand with the Office of Equity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so begin that I want that reflected in this in this motion to begin the process of shifting the Human Relations Commission to an end and rethinking its scope to work hand in hand with the Office of Equity and and provide some public engagement and civilian oversight to this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are a number of other things here that I want to jump into. What I'm going to do now is I'm going to work through it. If I run out of time, I'll come back up. So on goal number three, as it relates to KPCC and investigations, I want to ask a question of staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see that we have a of resources in this budget and within the plan to bring on a consultant and begin the process of changing our charter to update the PCC. My goal, I think what's important, what I've heard from the community is that we don't want to see small adjustments but rather an overhaul.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So sort of like get rid of the PCC and build a modern oversight commission which will take some, some time, but we want to do it on the next general election. And so I want to understand from staff, one is that the plan here and to more specifically with respect to evaluating other accountability processes, with respect to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'investigate and other things, are those included within the scope of of this this contract or this consulting that you're bringing on to help work with work on this? That's my first question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have included $150,000 in the proposed budget to address the PCC. The our vision is that we would bring on an outside expert who could help us independently review how our structure works, compare it to other structures, and give us best practices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Give us ideas on how a commission could be changed or reformed or improved. We're also looking for short term improvements that the election would not be allowed to be on the ballot until 2022 per state law. So we would have two years under the current system if the council wanted to change it in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we see it as a comprehensive review that would be year one. And then going forward there would be $150,000 to help implement. So we believe that there are some changes that can be made that would help the current commission do its job a little bit more efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Better. And then we could look at all the other best practices as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. You have one minute, sir. Okay. Thank you. So in that so I'll just stay on this topic and read to four for another. And so in terms of goal to I want to be clear that we're beginning the process of C.P.S. within the scope of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also want to look at just the investigations process and the new commission should have some independence. It should have is restore public confidence that you have some some some authority to conduct some investigations. I don't understand what can be done before the election in 2022 and and what the process looks like in the march between now'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and 2022. So that can come back in two from four. I think on the issue will then go to on youth development, violence prevention. I want to I want to understand it further. And this is questions that the capacity or building on violence prevention, is this a mechanism to bring in more community based intervention workers and things'",
        "'speaker_0': 'like that to help us achieve violence prevention? How are you thinking about this? That's for Kevin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So in terms of the violence prevention structure would be to we would hire one additional person as part of the city's violence prevention team to help manage and coordinate that program. At this time, we only have one full time equivalent supporting all the violence prevention efforts within the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we'd bring one new person on and then through that work with community efforts around coordination of efforts, but also providing funding and resources to community based organizations to to engage in violence prevention work that that they are known for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman. I'm out of time, so I have to back up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Vice Mayor. Mayor, if I can ask a question. So I think we're going to hear from the council a number of ideas and comments and things that they would like to see. For staff, it would be really helpful if we had that in the form of a motion so that we can track what is it that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the full council supports. So I believe I heard Councilmember Richardson start in saying he was making a motion. I just want to confirm that's the case. And there were six items that we had. If we could follow a process where we have a motion and substitute motions and others that would help us get clear direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, we have video of a motion by Councilman Richardson. Yes. Okay, fine. We'll come back you. We'll get that done in that order. Okay. Consequences in the hands.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to say a big, big thank you to Councilmember Richardson for having the courage and the brilliant ness of putting something together like this in, especially as we are facing in this very difficult time. I also want to give thanks to staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I for this presentation that they gave. That was really great. I know that this work involved a lot of facilitating and reaching out and being creative and and it was long, hard and very emotional for all parties. And I think that, you know, to be able to do this and in such a quick, you know, time was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'also very incredibly difficult. So I commend you for your efforts into putting this all together. I'm also incredibly grateful to all of the residents and community members that have been involved in this process by engaging in this very painful but necessary and and absolutely overdue work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This report puts in black and white. What would people of color in Long Beach have been have known for for many years? So I'm grateful that we're acknowledging the significance of having these truths come out and and and supported by our city leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We should continue to keep in mind that this comes only after decades and decades of our city being unresponsive to experiences of people of color and their activism in the face of systemic racism and white supremacy. We need to really keep that in mind going forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's important for us to keep that in our mind and know how critical it has been to be able to listen and actually discuss all of the things that have come out in this report. I'm heartened by some of the policy changes provided in this report, and I think that we have an excellent starting point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, I will say an excellent starting point in beginning to address some of these issues. I am particularly excited to see some immediate and short term movement on expanding our language access programs to better include our residents, including immigrants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On very excited about the amendments made to this motion to have something separate for the Latino and the Cambodian community. I, I think that these kinds of structural changes, especially when attached to increasing funding for staff and all the responsibilities are are a good way to create an equitable outcome for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also think that it's critically important that we. That that we have space to have these conversations. And in our actions as counsel for, you know, we as counsel have the responsibility to listen to our constituents and hear them out and see really listen to what some of the solutions would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Majority of participants in the reconciliation process so far have unequivocally voiced support for reinvesting resources and in other departments like youth and programs. One of the things said that I want to see is also investing funds in in prevention of violence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that that's very important. So with that being said, I just want to say thank you, Councilmember Richardson, for bringing this forward and really listening to our to our residents. So with that, I just want to say that I fully support the motion and I'm happy to second this motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much come to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, sorry. Did you take the wrong time, sir?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Just one point of clarification, Vice Mayor, when you say council members have 5 minutes each time by the council members themselves. Because sometimes when we ask a question, it takes another two or 3 minutes for an answer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to get a clarification on that. Or is it just 5 minutes of total conversation to the council member and staff?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the rules say the question and the answer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Yes. Want to get clarification on that? Yes, sir. Okay. Because it can be a little bit can be a little frustrating. Yes. First of all, I want to thank. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Chandler for taking the leadership in this and and her honesty. She was very straightforward in saying that there were some mistakes made and acknowledge those and that and and address those. And that's is going to make everything better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's where we're at right now. I mean, let's face it, there have been mistakes all over all over the place, especially in the treatment of people, the treatment of our LGBT community. Keeping the women. And, you know, when it comes right down to it, I see it as a perfect storm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I will say I said it before, I'll say it again. This started because the atmosphere in our country began with a racist. It began with Charlottesville. It began with his in the willingness to accept the the the decision of a Mexican-American judge who was making a judgment, an adjudication on his.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Trump University. It started there Alachua and then a Lach was let George Floyd unfortunately that rest his soul lost his life because of racism. Because of the atmosphere that was created in this country by. And then we have a pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what did the pandemic do? It raised to the to the surface the fact that there are a lot of inequities and injustices out there in the community when it comes to public health, when it comes to health care in general, that, you know, people can't afford it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And people are having a difficult time getting access to the proper medical care that they need. And then on top of that, we have a down on economic downturn that raised even more issues about wages and disparities in wages and disparities in jobs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, men making white men making two, three, four times more that than Latino women, African-American women and women in general. And so what we have here is, is the perfect storm. And I'm glad that this came forward because it's putting it to the through the the discussion is putting that on the table and the very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'painful discussion that we have to have with one another. And it's and it's time and we're we're in a we're in a in a in a in a in a current time right now where we can have this discussion, where we can put it all out there and just put it on the table and, you know, let's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'clear the air. And I know it's painful. Miss Chandler experienced that pain and we continue to feel that pain and we're working through it. And we will we will we will survive this. We will work this through. And I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing this forward as the idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to know that that we know we were present. I hope that this document will be a living document. That will be a document that we can go back to, that it will not be shelved, that it will be a document that we will always revisit and make better because we're going to continue this discussion'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and it's going to grow. Council Member ten there has said it perfectly. You know, we we still need further, more discussions to be held in the Latino community and in the Cambodian as well as to the Filipino community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we need more input from our LGBT community and women. But I see this document as being alive and being able to add to it to make it all that much stronger. And I'm looking forward to I know Councilmember Richardson has that finished on his amendments that he has for his motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm looking forward to some of those supporting that. But as a whole, I certainly support support this framework. And I think it's a very positive step moving forward. And I'm very proud of Long Beach. I mean, the people came out, they spoke their piece, and they're adding their voices to this document as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's typical is a typical conversation, but it's one that's necessary. We have to have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor Raymond Miranda, councilman. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. I really want to take a moment first to recognize our council members that really worked hard to bring this forward. Councilmember Richardson has been leading a lot of the conversation, as he's known to to like to get out there and roll his sleeves up on everything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we really have to thank the fact that we've got Councilmember Austin and Councilmember Dee Andrews who have been leading this and having their own conversations in their own networks and really facing some of the historical racism that has existed in the city of Long Beach for a really long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I say that because when I got on council as a bright eyed, bushy tailed progressive that ran on police reform, when I tried to talk about some of the racial inequities, it was really uncomfortable. And I think that we're having this conversation as an entire city, and it's really uncomfortable, and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that our staff, like Teresa, who got thrown into a new position and then thrown into it and thrown into this leadership, have found themselves in difficult moments. And I remind everybody that if we didn't have these emotional moments, if we didn't have tension, if we didn't have difficult conversations and accountability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We wouldn't be doing the right thing. And that's how we know that while this process might not be perfect for everybody, it's a process that the city really, really needs to have. I look and I see that we've had council members that have been on this council for a long time stepping up and leading on these difficult'",
        "'speaker_1': 'conversations. And it it makes me feel really hopeful. I also see young black women that are leading and speaking up on almost every council meeting that I've never spoken at a council meeting before. And the fact that we have people like Don and Shereen, but also Theresa and others that are sharing their stories and trying to facilitate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a conversation while also experiencing this difficult moment is really hard. And so I feel very humbled to be a part of this conversation. And I never in my 13 years of doing community organizing work in Long Beach thought that we would have such an open conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I know it's been tough for people like Tom, and I want to applaud Tom for for being present, but being in the middle of every single stakeholder that has something to say about this work. And I know that that's not easy, but I also know that this conversation was started because Black Lives Matter and they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'didn't feel like they mattered. And until somebody says, I, I am a black woman or a black man, and I can tell you that I feel respected, that I feel like people in my community see me as someone who contributes and matters, and we haven't done our job yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so reading this really in what the speaker said is this is about reconciliation for the entire city, but it's about police, us in particular. And Black Lives Matter have have spoken up community members have signed letters. All the organizations that spoke that Councilmember Richardson listed earlier signed a letter asking for 12% of the police budget to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be cut. And I know that when the budget came out, we were really you know, we felt like we were in a really good place. We were at 5% that it was higher than L.A. But then it came back that maybe the numbers weren't exactly what we needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the very first sign that we need to have a transparent budget next week whenever the budget comes back from PD. Our new budget book. I understand we've been in a difficult situation with COVID, but our residents need to see exactly what is in our police budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, as a councilwoman need to understand what is in our police budget so that we can match those priorities. I think it's very important that we recognize. That this is really hard for our or our police officers. Nobody can question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have one minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I'll make motions when I come back up. But I couldn't have this vote tonight without grounding us in this. I have always been outspoken about reforming PD, but I also know a lot of police officers and I'm talking directly to our police officers right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do not believe. At every single one of our police officers. Is inherently racist. I believe that our police department has lacked accountability and transparency. Is positioned in a military way that allows it to operate without the council having full oversight and without the voters, the constituents, all of the residents live here, whether their voters are not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to have a say. And that is what this process has to be about. This process has to be about transparency and accountability and making sure that people's tax dollars are going to make every single person feel safe in the city, not just some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I wanted to ground the rest of my conversations and not that I recognize that. And I recognize this is a hard moment, but we cannot let this moment pass this by without making real reform in this direction tonight that we give stop is where we start.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll come back up. Thank you. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, can you hear me? Hello?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I. So, first of all, let me just just say, I would really like to express my deep and sincere appreciation to everyone who has been involved in the preparation of this framework document. Now, I salute our city manager for for taking it on, Teresa Chandler, for leading this charge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dr. Davis, your introduction was, you know, heartfelt, truly felt that reading it. And I want to thank our Health Department Mobile's policy and the many community stakeholders who weighed in and provide hours of testimony over the dozen or so more listening sessions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those sessions were not easy. Weren't easy to listen to. And conversations about race are never easy or comfortable. And I think it should be noted, and it has been that this is a monumental document that demonstrates our city's commitment to being more inclusive and equitable from the inside out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This document represents a clear denunciation of racism. And it's a beginning and an earnest attempt to repair a broken system. I think it goes much further than addressing police violence and accountability. You know, as the city council member representing the eighth District, I'm reminded of the abhorrent redlining practices that existed in my neighborhood just a few decades'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ago. I would not have been able to own or live in the home that I live in. You know, 40, 50 years ago. The first black family integrated Bixby Knolls in 1958, Dr. Charles Cherry bought a beautiful home on Cerritos Avenue in Bixby Knolls, and that family was met with vitriolic acts of racism and rejection by their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'neighbors, who say they did not receive a warm welcome. And being the first being the first black in the first minority is never, ever easy either. Today we vote against racism. We vote against anti-Blackness. If this vote tonight honors the lives of Medgar Evers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Trayvon Martin. George Floyd and many, many others. This vote tonight is when I take this vote is on behalf of my three black sons, my future grandchildren, to live in a more equitable society. As for our youth, our black and Latino youth, and for my youth to be able to live in a city that extends opportunities and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'supports their dreams. You know, I like to also pay some recognition tonight also to some of the great works that actually preceded this framework document. And I think we'd be remiss if we didn't acknowledge Dr. Lydia Holly and the Reading Sea Program and that grant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know Traci Colombo is still with the city and she worked very hard on that. Dr. Alex Norman in the state of Black Long Beach. I think it's also, again, important to recognize that this is a beginning. It's a start.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm encouraged that Councilmember Richardson has made some amendments to extend this this opportunity to really, really dig in deep and talk about our our racial differences, our cultural needs as a city and include, you know, our Latino and my brothers and sisters, because it's important for us to continue this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I said the conversation about race is never and systematic oppression is not meant to be comfortable. But we should get comfortable in having these conversations because I feel like we're going to have to have this conversation for many years to come.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'm impressed with this document. I think it's comprehensive. And if we are able to implement half of what is being recommended here, we are going to be a better city for it. And so I'll just just add to my before I know my time is short.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, it is. Yes, it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The CBC reform package to reform our civilian oversight to provide more accountability. I'm glad to see that that in here and the commitment in our budget to do that. I do believe I brought an item a few weeks ago that actually calls for everything that that that that that Councilmember Richard Simmons is asking for in his amendment'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I'm not sure if that's really necessary. I also want to see greater emphasis on reentry support. I'm glad that we're doing that. I think that is critical, particularly of today with the release of thousands of inmates from CDCR and other institutions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to have to have a plan to support these these these people that will come at home to our city. Cannabis Equity. I want greater emphasis on on ownership and business opportunities. And and I'm glad.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To ask you, time is up, so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll reach you. But I'm glad to see that the equity will be under the city manager's office because that shows a real commitment to equity in our city. So with that, I'll pick you up later. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Councilman Austin, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few, share a few thoughts on the topic. Obviously, we all agree every single member of this council in our city team, that racism is a serious issue and that it's important that we as a city take it seriously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I love the approach of starting internally. I was very pleased to see the number of city staff members that participated in the listening session. I know that some of my own staff participated in the listening session and some of the ideas that were shared regarding training and hiring practices and promotional opportunities and some of the things'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that were raised are topics that have been close to my heart for a long time. In terms of gender equity, of course, being that that's an issue that I've personally experienced. So that's been a priority for us to see that being expanded throughout the city and every department in terms of opportunities and access was very, very good'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for me to hear and for me to get a recap on what those listening sessions were like with the staff. I think the time and energy that's been committed to this topic from both staff and the residents speaks to the importance of this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank everyone who took time to be a part of that conversation. I know that we had about 8% of the 500 participants, 500 individual residents participated in these listening sessions. And of those, about 8% of them were third district residents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know that we've hosted a number of town halls and produced some interviews on this topic to further engage our residents at one of our town halls, we had over 200 participants. And so I want to thank all the residents who have participated on this issue, on on on all sides of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've had a lot of residents express an interest in rerouting police dollars. We've also had a lot of residents reach out and express a lot of support for continuing police funding. And so we've we've heard from every resident and we welcome that inclusive attitude as far as our office, because we want to hear the diversity on the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'topic. I look forward to the continuing engagement on this as we continue to work to make this city the best that it can be. I want to thank my colleagues on the Public Safety Committee. Councilman Austin and Councilman Super.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are going through a process on the public safety committee that is a little bit of a slower process. That's a multi-phased approach where we're first and foremost finding out what it is that our police department actually does in regards to some of these topics.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then hearing from them what some of the best practices that are taking place around the nation are, and hopefully working with the stakeholders to develop recommendations similar to what we'll talk about in the upcoming agenda items tonight in regards to recommendations to the full Council for changes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we'll be doing that consistently between now through October and as we develop some new policies and practices in the full Council, we'll certainly incorporate those and the public safety discussions as well. The document that we have before us today provides a lot of information to build upon and to work from, and I look forward to having'",
        "'speaker_1': 'more in-depth discussions with the council and city staff as each of these proposals and ideas is researched and evaluated to see what is feasible, what can be implemented, and what works for the city of Long Beach. Recognizing that we can't take any sort of cookie cutter approach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a very unique city. We have a unique police department with an amazing police chief who is leading his team and is very open to progress and creativity and inclusivity. And I look forward to having him be our partner in this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price, Councilman Richardson. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So I'm going to keep working through calls on goal number two. I was talking about youth development and violence prevention, community partnerships. So I know that we're developing this office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my expectation, my hope and my understanding in talking with the health department is we want to sort of go back to working hand in glove with community as it relates to intervention workers and youth support. I know that the City Council's moved forward a measure for four November that would apply additional resources should it should it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be adopted to develop and strengthen some of these partnerships. I want to I want to go back to the health department. Did you speak a little bit more about how sort of is this approach that we're going to just hire a bunch of staff that's going to do the work?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we going to or are we going to develop, you know, go back to developing community partnerships and do those things?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um. Councilmember So the, the intent would be to hire two staff for the Office of Youth Development. Um, one would be sort of a program manager level support as well as a program coordinator to, to really engage with our community members and then to start to really invest in peer navigators and other, and then with other community'",
        "'speaker_7': 'youth serving organizations in the community. So the focus right now, based on feedback that we've received, would be to invest in to community based organizations, to focus on peer navigation and the ability to link and youth to different services for mental health services, as well as skill development to youth for managing difficult situations and also mentoring opportunities'",
        "'speaker_7': '. There's also a lot of focus on the ability and the ability. So job skills and training, the ability, academic supports and all of those. So the intent would be to, um, to invest in community based organizations now and that and as future funding of it becomes available, the same would be in place for the violence prevention program'",
        "'speaker_7': '. As I indicated before, we have sort of one FTE dedicated to violence prevention in the city right now. Now, we would hire one more person for that space to join that, to better coordinate and work within communities.

        "'speaker_7': 'efforts in the city, and really focusing on reducing community level trauma and gun violence. Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Moving forward. Thank you. And the reason I ask that question, I think it's important to me and it's important to understand the vision here. I think the vision should be building a capacity within our communities that, you know, people who, you know, many based organizations that are here, people who live within the communities because it's 24 and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they you know, they know it's a part of when, you know, I do that on my staff. We hired people that are within the district. They you know, they are it's a different commitment and it's 24 seven and they're really, you know, care about what you know, the transformation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's just called community empowerment model. And so that that's really what I'm what I'm looking for here. I want to go three. I want to talk a little bit and asking questions about officer constitutional policing. I know that this wasn't referenced in in the process of the framework.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It came in towards the end. I'm just not clear on what it is. I know we'll have a more careful conversation when we get to the budget, but I think that any examination of public safety reform, it certainly has to have buy in from from the department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we also need to make sure that it maintains the whole point is to build public trust. So I'd like to know and understand, you know, could could you be prepared to talk either next week at the budget meeting or whatever, about efforts that we can do to make sure that there is public trust in that process'",
        "'speaker_0': ', public participation in that process, and also an understanding of what the one year work plan looks like from office constitutional policing, because, you know, the health department's put forward a one year work plan. We saw what the Economic Development Department is doing in terms of one year work plan of the equity is putting forward a one year'",
        "'speaker_0': 'work plan. So I'd like to know what office constitutional policing plan to take on within the first year. So that's a question for Mr. Moore. Okay. And Councilman Wilson, you have one more minute. So I that's my question I'm waiting for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, yes, we can certainly get into that. The chief is eager to talk a little bit about the efforts and all the things that they're doing that really hasn't been the focus of this effort in the last two months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's been more of the listening and getting to some of the high level recommendations, but the police department certainly has a lot to share. I'm proud of the efforts that they're working on and that they're thinking of how they can do things differently and look at best practices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's part of the Office of Constitutional Policing and it's focus. So I would suggest we get into that next week when the Chief has a chance to present his budget and really talk in his own words, him and while inhibits who's kind of leading that effort to talk about the constitutional policing effort and what that would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'entail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'll give you back the amount of time. Thank you. Consulate Councilwoman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm sorry, I. I will pick up now on the emotions that I wanted to talk about. I totally support the moves that Councilmember Richard Richardson mentioned. And I to agree there's a constitutional policing understanding that more and understanding where the oversight is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I think that the question that I brought up before was how do we get to transparency? How do we get to accountability? I support completely overhauling the PCC. There's a lot of great work that's been done nationally about the best models to do that, and I think we as a city have already demonstrated that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'know how to put together a commissions that are civilian oversight commissions and we need to do that. But we also need to make sure there are changes put in right away. Something that I would like to include as a motion, as to include a report on the cahoots model.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And honestly, I read this and I've never heard anybody say it, even though I've read it through some of the reports. So I hope I'm saying it the right way. But it was mentioned several times throughout the reconciliation process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have it in a couple of emails and letters from my constituents. I think a report on that would bring us to a place where we could decide what might be the next best step for things like the hunting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would also like to understand a little bit more about the police hiring. One of the things that's happened in the last several years was we did an H.R. audit. We talked about some of the outdated regulations as it pertains to cannabis, and we made changes for most of our departments, but we did not make any changes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that I can recall, as it were, in regards to police officers being tested for cannabis use or for being able to be hired if they had smoked cannabis or use cannabis. Given the state law right now, given the fact that so many of our black community members have been incarcerated for a job that is illegal now, I'",
        "'speaker_1': 'think we need to make sure that we're aligning our police department. And I know that when we brought this up with H.R. during that study, it was told to us, well, there's different standards for police. Well, I look at this the same way that I would look at a glass of wine or a beverage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't need officers. We don't need anybody on our city staff or on taxpayer dollars coming in under the influence of any drugs at all or alcohol. And so I would expect the same thing for cannabis. I'd like to have a report on what the standards are for that, and perhaps that is something that's keeping some of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the diversity challenges at bay a little bit, not you spend as much time. So to be clear, so far, I would like to add into a motion a report on the Cahoots Model. I report my support for the PCC and also a review of police hiring.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The next thing that has been brought to my attention through this process and also talking to my constituents is the process that happens whenever our police officers. Well, let me back up. The process that happens whenever residents might have their cars impounded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know that there are people that have had their cars impounded whenever they've been brought into the police station. I hear tales and this is why I would like a report on this, that they once they're released, even if they weren't found necessary to stay in jail or found guilty, they're still responsible for paying their income'",
        "'speaker_1': 'fees, which can be 100 bucks to somebody like myself or somebody that's without a job. Can can mean a lot. And I know one of my constituents had her car in impound for several months and likely didn't even get it back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want us to look at some of those policies that exasperate some of the poverty and some of the challenges our residents might face whenever they come into contact with the city. Not just PD, but like I said, telling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pierce, you have one minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will go ahead and take a break. At this point, my next I'll just I'm not sure if anybody's queued up after me, but I think we have some questions, so I'll go ahead and queue up one more time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Goodbye. And thank you, Councilman Supernova. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I'd also like to thank everyone who participated in this effort, because it has been a huge, huge task and it's not gone unnoticed. I also want to thank Councilman Price for for referencing the Public Safety Committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's a lot of valuable information coming out of those meetings that we're holding monthly, and it'd be great to find a way to get that integrated into this system here. Also, Councilman Richardson mentioned division and I think we can get there with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clearly articulating what the vision is. My greater concern is with the execution of many of the ideas. And I think Kelly Collopy has multiple initiatives to execute, and I guess it wouldn't be fair to ask her. But the city manager, is there going to be a process where as we we get feedback from Kelly policy on how'",
        "'speaker_0': 'these things are going that those those items would come back to council or we can provide assistance or reshape these initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. So what you're approving tonight is really just some general direction. It's a concept, it's a framework. There is high level recommendations. You're approving kind of staff to keep moving in this direction and be working on these items, at which point we would be bringing them back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'll notice in the report some are saying ongoing and immediate. Some are short term, long term, medium term. And we put timelines to those so similar to the Everyone Home Initiative to Affordable Housing Plan, we would be working on those and bringing those back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they all need to still go through legal review, through financial review, through implementation, feasibility and then ultimately council policy approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It great that that would work. Implementation, feasibility. Also, I just want to complete the thought with my conversation with our fire chief because I did reference this agenda item one when I spoke to him. And that is I just think we have to be very cautious on proposals of balancing a budget by cutting core fire services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are just essential services to the black community and communities of color with sworn personnel that cannot be, you know, so that was my point here, that we want to be very cautious on just even the consideration of cutting off services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's it. Thank you all. Thank you. Councilman Chippenham. Councilman Arango.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. And, you know, this is getting very frustrating for me. Richardson has some motions he wants to make. Yeah, he had to keep recovery queueing. I concede my attempt to Councilmember Ritchie let him finish what he can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I think the proper thing to do. Thank you. That was made during I think the appropriate thing to do, Mr. Vice Mayor, would be to suspend the rule of suspend the rule or extend the rule. I think we're getting out of the discussion and more into the specifics.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So if you're okay, I would request that we just suspend the rule for the rest of this discussion when we're done with public comment. We're really in the meat and potatoes now, if that's okay with you and I'm hearing you exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you're the last ones cued up, so I just want you guys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is not your mayor. Mr. Vice Mayor, I've been cute for a while and haven't been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you can, but I haven't seen you up here, so I'm just like Mr. Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay? I'm not asking you to go ahead. I just didn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get the last one queued.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, it is. Okay, so queue up and we'll put you there. Okay. All right. So if you want. Okay, great. Okay, so I'm going through. So I was on goal three. We talked a little bit, our constitutional policing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got the response that we're going to hear more at the next step. So that's good. Thank you. I know that the topic of demilitarization came up but wasn't included in the recommendations. I've been looking at what you know, what modern cities do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The idea here is to just make sure that any purchases of things that are not within the normal scope of use of a you know, of police officer has some additional level of scrutiny by the city council before publicly, you know, purchases are made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's not sort of a consent calendar or buried within a consent calendar, but a little bit more sunshine. And so I'd like for staff to look at some of these models and I see them all over the place now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They add 60 days, 90 days. Notice the city council when you're buying things like, you know, you know, automatic weapons or or tanks or whatever it is, I mean, I think we need to understand these purchases a bit more and city council needs to and needs to have the time to dove in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to include in my motion for staff to look at some options for the city council to consider that help address demilitarization. So I want to make sure that that's included in here, you know, as we move forward so that I want that reflected in in this motion on goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's maybe some other stuff I may come back to, but but on go for about health and wellness and economics. I want to make sure that I know that we saw what the what the one year plan is for economic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make sure that if I heard Kelly mention the job coordinator on the project labor agreement, she said PR instead of play, I knew what she was saying. I want to be clear with the public. I think that the play is up for negotiation now and I think it should be reflected in the economic developed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'economic equity piece of this, the very specific goals aligned with the independent jobs coordinator targeting whatever it is we're going to do. I think that should be very clearly set out in the CFF or however this is going to come back in terms of the strategy around the first year on economic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to see that part come out. I also know that there was in the slide, it's called out a number of things, economic empowerment zones in procurement, all these other things. I want to say that some of the dynamics may change in November in terms of Proposition 15, if it passes, which is the restoration of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a front of affirmative action. If that happens, we need to be positioned to we need to understand how that may open up the playbook a little bit in terms of procurement and the things we can do to really make a meaningful difference for local, local businesses of color, minority owned businesses, black owned businesses, Latino businesses, women on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'business and so forth. So I want to make sure that we are in this next year's work. Clay On Economics, we are paying attention to that because I want to respond to that. Should that be adopted in November and go into effect in January additionally?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so are these two items added into the motion or are these are these more comments now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are these are in the motion. Okay. I want to see. So you're already we already have the economic equity sort of one year plan in the presentation. I want I want to understand those two parts of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the local jobs coordinator and how we can connect procurement to whatever new opportunities come out of the proposition. I think that proposition is maybe about 50, whatever the proposition do. Okay. Five, Thank you. Okay. So next related to the housing and so there's been a lot of discussion in the budget, in the people's budget and over'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the years about aligning sort of our work around housing and this we can't talk racial equity. I'll talk about housing. 80% of black households in Long Beach are rental households. 70% of Latino households in Long Beach are rental households.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I certainly I grew up a renter, but I certainly support homeownership and we need to make commitments to that and we have to work toward that. But but what I what I think what what the community is asking for is for us to be more specific, more strategic about ultimately aligning and creating a division sort of dedicated'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to this. And what this looks like to me is you have a proposal for a housing and homelessness equity coordinator. Already you have I see in development services you've already made some changes. You have Christopher Coombs focused on housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now you have a housing authority to focus on, on, on renters, in subsidies. You have resources that we've begun, begun to deploy around rental assistance. And, you know, should additional resources come out, that's something we want to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've been engaged over the last 18 months and moratoriums and renter tenant protections and all of these. Issues, but it's not centralized within our system. And so we can that effectively creates a barrier. And so I want to I want to, within this first year, have this housing equity person focus on beginning to align this to create'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a front door on this issue. So this is so this isn't adding an additional like budgetary action. What I'm saying is, like within what we have, let's align it and see how we can put a front door. Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tommy Kelly on with what I'm asking here. Yes. Okay, great. So I want to make sure that that this rental housing operation, the vision, however, is going to land. I want to make sure that this is reflected in the into the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do that. And we've covered the majority of things that I have here. I'm going to pause and just keep listening to my colleagues if they have anything else but that. That concludes my comments at this point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Mango.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just as a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Richardson, did you say automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want you know, I want to be clear, I'm not an expert on the weapons that police department carry. So I want to be clear. What I'm asking is for staff to bring some options to us around demilitarization.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The things I'll be looking for is giving counsel additional notification, oversight, oversight. So as things come, we're aware of it. You know, I don't want to make I just militarization get out. Militarization shouldn't be an automatic thing. That's the point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It should be we should be heading in a different direction. And you already have city council in place. Going to have to bring me some bring me bring us some options to think about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I am supportive of that idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just want to be clear with our constituents that the consent calendar to date, as I as I've been on the council, has never included the purchase of a tank or an automatic weapon or any of those things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand the general concept you were going for, but I just wanted to be clear about that because I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quickly received a text from a family member and just wanted to ask me that question. And I thought I would be public about the fact that. Mr. Chief Lulu, do we have any tanks or any of those things?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Chief Looney or Chief Hbert, if you could respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A vice mayor and members of the city council. No, we do not have tanks and we don't have any military equipment. I know that's part of the national narrative, but at one point I can't wait to actually talk about the things that this police department does and what we have so we can get away from all these'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Things that people are thinking that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Especially because in chief.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Linda, please feel free to correct me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But offices across the country are trained in how to occasionally and very few officers, by the way, are trained in how to take apart and ensure that an automatic weapon that's been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Taken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From a resident who should not have one because they are illegal. Even the police need special training to be able to do that because it is so dangerous and you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Put people or officers in harm's way or innocent bystanders. Okay. So now that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's clear, I want to thank the city.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Continue to push forward just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It just the amount of respect and praise and appreciation for them and their. Their fortitude and. Their leadership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to say that I see one major thing missing from this reconciliation. I mean, I've heard from the public on a lot of things, but this particular.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thing hasn't been mentioned in a long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as budget chair two years ago, it was one of the most important things I heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From minority communities and communities of color was that there wasn't investment in the infrastructure, in the communities that need that. So if we talk about health, we need to talk about sidewalks. And I'm not saying take all the sidewalk money as it's distributed today and move it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm saying we need to add $10.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Million of additional sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Repairs. I worked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With Councilmember Odinga on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Making sure we had funding for a park that was in his community, that had a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Group of community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seniors that walked every day. And that walking path was of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Extreme importance to him and that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Community. I worked with Councilmember Andrews on a business corridor improvement that is still almost to completion, but these walking paths and corridors are critical to minority owned businesses and our communities of color and the health and wellness of our city and our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'd like to find.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A way to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Add additional.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'To the safety and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well-Being of our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I appreciate everyone who's spoken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tonight, and I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That this dialog will continue, but I hope that these things that have been brought up before. Yes, we've made significant investment in these things in the last six years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's not enough. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman. Mongo. Councilwoman. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I support all of the items that Councilmember Richardson mentioned. I think they're all things that our community members have spoken on. And I guess I do have a question for our city manager. Obviously, PD has been a target of a lot of this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, PD be responding to this. Well, we have another opportunity. I know that. I mean, I think he's right. Like, I, I feel like we have asked time and time again for a full report from PD on everything from hiring to training, and that that has been really difficult to get agendas in my four years on council'",
        "'speaker_1': '. It seems like the prime time to be able to do that and I know we've got them on the Budget Committee or budget presentation next week, but I don't know if that's the appropriate time for us to dove in all the way to all the PD stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Would you inform us of when that might be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So that's actually one of the recommendations that's in front of you tonight. We added that it is a recommendation to come back in a study session to have the discussion with the council. The police chief is absolutely right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There has not been in the last two months that kind of, I think, appetite or desire to really dove in and talk about what is PD do currently. And so during the listening sessions we heard loud and clear they did not want to be part of the listening sessions, and we respected that when it came to, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, creating all of the recommendations, we had all of our departments review those recommendations and be able to provide input into what you've seen tonight. But the police department has not had a chance to come in and really fully and publicly explain the training that they do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What they have for equipment, how they put things into practice, and to have that dialog with the community and the council. They are eager to do that and that is one of our recommendations. I do suggest that you take some time for that and for us to, you know, prepare that larger presentation because there is a lot'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that they do that this community and city can be very proud of. And and I think the council member mentioned it, Richardson is they also have a workplan of what they want to continue to improve and to look at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we we recommend scheduling that. I will work on when we've been able to do that and that work is is starting to happen right now in the Public Safety Committee, as Councilmember Price mentioned. And we can bring more of that to the full council as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I think as part of this recommendation, not only having it one time, but that needs to be, you know, on a regular basis every year before the budget process starts. We need to be able to fully understand what's happening in our police department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I don't know if I need to make that as a part of the motion, but I would hope that annually we have a full review of police practices and any of the work that comes out of this reconciliation process over the next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would hope that we have that coming back to us and a full report. I know Councilmember Richardson had in his motion every six months for a full report on the on the framework that we're talking about. But P3 being, you know, the size of the budget and just feel like we haven't had access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that that needs to be included in there. So. I'll move on to my next my next topic, which should be my my last topic. So it's mentioned under health. There's a bunch of things that are put underneath health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that the beginning of this report does a great job. Not only I mean, Dr. Davis, like just, wow, I want to say how much I appreciate your voice right now. We know that that this I do not think if this conversation was being had four years ago, that your voice would be so present and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so center in this work. And while some people might not love that that I gave thanks to Tom, I do give that to Tom and his leadership, because that hasn't been the city that we've had for the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So grounding it in health, we then put in a whole bunch of other things. The climate work is really, really important because I think I've said many times over the last several months, the Environmental Committee and the Sustainability Committee, our commission have met a couple of times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They did make a recommendation, a letter of support. I hope that that letter is reflected in the comments and maintained in this report for the long term, but also to the comment around the the jobs coordinator and some of the jobs pieces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to make sure that in this report it's reflected that people have been talking about a resilient recovery. And essentially, if we could make sure that we're talking about what jobs could, as we're closing the climate gap, that climate gap, it's getting late.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry for our black community members and our communities of color. We want to make sure we include a review of how our Climate Adaptation Action Plan could provide jobs pipeline for those front line communities, communities of color and our black community members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that is my last addition. Hopefully that made it as a motion and I am done speaking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you of my time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Councilman Richardson. Thank you. So I think I'll go ahead and wrap this thing up. So I want to acknowledge Councilman Mango's discussion on infrastructure. I do know that you've been talking, which is excuse me for you wrap this up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I like to speak. So when you finish. Absolutely. Go. Go for it. I was going to acknowledge that the friend had to go for it. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, and I want to thank every single individual took part in this conversation to come up with this report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, as the elder councilman both in office and in age, you know, I can tell you stories about Long Beach in this city. I was not allowed to buy a home in the big city, not because of the color of my skin.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I went to buy me a very expensive car. Then it was brought to this, you know, to the car. And they told me, I have a school district. So that's not the image of a teacher. That kind, you know, car is not the image of a teacher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I remember when I and other black individuals could not go past almeida's hill and other streets without risk of getting beat by police. I remember when my mother used to earn clothes as a net as a maid in the Wrigley District, which is the big city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Being here for so long, though, I have also seen the inequities to other communities of color, like the Latinos and bodies and Filipinos. Racial equity goals in this report are great but cannot confidently say that I like how we went about this process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cobra did not help our public outreach process. They are members of our community and still feel left out or a sentiment that this process divided racist. And that's it. Because the beginning that all of us on this does is continue to do the work in our districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm hoping that our community based organizations truly come together and work for the benefit of our community. I don't want to go under the five minute situation because everyone knows I am going to stop here and that everyone will participate in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank you for all the print, Glenn, the Adams. Thank you very much. Now you can finish introducing you Vice Mayor. So I just want to acknowledge. So on the infrastructure conversation, it is reflected in terms of infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's a proposal for economic equity zones in special districts in areas like north central west Long Beach to explore infrastructure and things like that. And John can speak a little bit more about that. Also, the questions about investing in the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The mayor made a made a proposal at the end of this fiscal year to begin visioning in a but zero based budget like process. I support that it's already in work, so I didn't lift that up in the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that would be an opportunity to look at things like infrastructure, investment and all that. So I think it's included in Councilmember. If you want to meet a place in the motion, I don't know that it's needed, but I will if it is important to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then. And then you want to respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I felt, though, that there wasn't any specificity to it. So I talked with Ms.. Chandler and Mr. Modica last week about how I'm looking to hear and outcomes and more specifics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the weeks ahead. And so I'm comfortable with it not being as a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Part of the motion. Okay. We can. Okay. And I'll be looking for that as well. And I think your city staff has heard you. I want to just thank the entire city council. I have to say this. You know, I deal with 191 cities in SCAD region, and this is a step further than any city in Southern'",
        "'speaker_0': 'California is taking to racial equity. You know, I'm not qualified to say it is one of the most bold steps in the United States on racial equity. But I'll tell you, having been engaged in the National League of Cities, the Governance Alliance of Racial Equity, we're building on the things that we've learned, and we're responding to the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'moment when other cities haven't even begun to learn how to have these conversation. These conversations haven't been pretty. I've seen I've heard peers on both sides of the conference calls, but I've also seen so many tears as a result of racial injustice in America.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is a pivotal point. This is the time for us to have these conversations, Leon, and really make a meaningful difference and hopefully put our city on a better course where it's not okay for race or zip code to determine your outcome, but rather our city is not successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And until almost all of us are successful. So so I want to offer my sincere thanks to the to the city council for this conversation as a zero thanks to city staff, a sincere thanks to all the community members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, I know that there's this is a big commitment we're making. I know folks want to see us go further. And this does not preclude us from continue to do that. But this is a meaningful step, a beginning of an important conversation in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward to continuing this work. And the city council looks forward to continue this work as we move forward. So that said, I thank you, Vice Mayor, and I yield my time. Thank you very much, Councilman Richardson.'",

I just want to thank the the police department's been really open to allowing us to have this process. And as we're doing this process, we're realizing that there's a lot of things that they had already proactively put into place that are part'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the national conversation now. So we have to bring those forth in and go through whatever process the city needs to go through to make them permanent order such that they appear in the training and policy manuals, because right now the special orders don't appear in the manuals.'",

We're also going to cover this partly in the budget presentation next week as well as we talk about what those special orders were that were implemented both in January and then the ones later with the carotid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we fully understand the item of of wanting to make those permanent. As Councilmember Price mentions, there is a process that you go through to have police practices and policies put in place in accordance with all labor laws and poobah and and state bargaining and all those things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that is the process we will be following. But there are special orders in place right now, and then they'll become permanent as we complete that.

        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, everyone. Thank you, Mr. City Manager and Vice Mayor and Council Member. So his comments in the special order specific to tonight is really about use of force in the January 2020 special order that we put in place to implement a lot of changes to our prior policy, which included de-escalation, duty to intervene, sanctity for human life'",
        "'speaker_0': ', and outlined those in a pretty lengthy document. So the special order actually affects the entire department and it's implemented when we find an immediate need or need to make an adjustment policy or procedure while we're going through the formalized policy implementation process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And through that process, we can have revisions and adjustments to the special order language. We do a consultation with the city attorney on the policy meeting, confer with labor unions, and then that goes into once we're done with that, it will go into our CPD policy manual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the meantime, know that special order access policy and as Councilmember Austin mentioned, is very robust. And there there are a lot more components to it that we can discuss at a later time. Thank you. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cosmos Consequentialist, do you still want to delay this or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No? I think it was explained here, so I don't think we need to delay it. But I would request that the staff provide a memo with all of those special orders to the entire council so that we know exactly what we're doing here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the Public Safety Committee made a recommendation to bring it forward of the city council to support those those those special orders. Adding the weight of the city council behind these policy changes, I think is very, very important.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Us this evening. Thank you very much. Contribution. Do you want to speak on the side? Yes. I'm just sorting through my book. I don't see any backup material, so I'm pretty sure these I think I have an idea of what we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What are we asking the council to do? I think you're talking about, you know, getting a report. On what? What changes city chief implemented? That's something we hear about. But what about what is what is this motion? I'm not clear what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't see any detail.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is Tom. I'll jump in there. So this is a report coming back from public safety. In in in all fairness, we probably should have kind of, you know, put some of the staff reports behind it. I think this just kind of came as a report from Special Public Safety Committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can certainly provide a memo with the various reports of the various special orders. I liken this to kind of a resolution of support. You know, I wouldn't advise that the council change policy without knowing what it is and going through the all the bargaining process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this is a sense of the council, essentially, that you'd like us to continue making those policies permanent so we can cover that next week. What those what those are in the budget presentation and then also give you actual copies of the policies that the police department is working to make permanent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think it's not unfair to to know what I'm I'm sure they're positive, but I just don't have anything in front of me. So I'd like to see what we're endorsing or writing a resolution in support of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do remember I did get a memo from Public Safety Committee. I didn't I don't have it in front of me. Um, so is there an opportunity? We're doing a study session. What are we doing? A study session on what our PDAs are going to be working on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're got a study session scheduled by way of the vote we just took on the reconciliation plan. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. It hasn't been scheduled yet. Honestly, our schedule is pretty full until we get through with the budget and then we can start looking at adding some additional study sessions in price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there some room to you know, I mean, I'm happy to support it because you have to look at it. But is there some room to do this next week when we deal with public safety? Was a question to Councilman Pryor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes can. You hear me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you were cutting out. I didn't hear what you said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can hear you now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Yeah, that's fine with me to continue it till next week. The memo that I drafted for that council is an update of public safety. Did have an overview of some of the special orders, but I think that detailed overview would be fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, good. Thank you. I support that. Is that it in Richardson? Yes. Vice Mayor. Okay, Castle. Councilwoman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Two questions for staff. One is I think that Councilmember Austin brought it up. But I just wanted to be clear, for community members that are engaging in this process, the Public Safety Committee is going through, as Councilmember Price also mentioned, a series of these reviews.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is the process for the city council and the city staff to change policy within the police department?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd have to ask the city attorney to help us with that. In general, you know, those types of policies and the operations of departments are delegated to the city manager who delegates them to the departments. We certainly listen to counsel and the council certainly sets overarching policy, but the implementation of specific practices of how things work'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the city by charter, it tends to be, you know, under the city manager and under the department. So we can certainly have our city attorney weigh in more and give us a further understanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I think specifically my question is it's not just the department, but the policies with our police officers. It's different from other departments. Right. Often some of these might require us to do a meet and confer. And I'm sure that there are lots of community members that are watching that don't know what a meet and confer'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is. So you could just talk about that briefly just as a transparency for community members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. In general, under state labor law, any policy that affects the working conditions has to go through certain types of varying bargaining processes with the the labor unions, whether that's in fire police or anywhere else in police. There are additional standards related to state law and post and all of the different training requirements, you know, that they're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'governed by under the state as well as local policies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for that. And that can take anywhere from one meeting to 20 meetings some time. So I just want to be transparent with community members while we're doing the work right now and the public safety team is doing the work as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It takes time to implement some of these because of that that process. The second question that I had. Was around the process for committees because I also just chaired two joint committees. And we just I just kind of assumed that the joint committee, the staff would put the detail in, but it's up to the chair to put'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those details into the agenda item if we're having a report back. Again, this is I'm assuming we're going to have a lot of key committee meetings through the end of the year with report backs. And just I think to council member Austin and Richardson's points want to make sure that those committee reports are included in the agenda'",
        "'speaker_1': 'item. So should that be on the council side or is that on the staff side?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, in general, when the committee meets and has their discussion, when they make whatever motions they're going to make that all, we can't take direction from a committee. And appropriately so. The Chair put this on for the council to to take action.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Where I think the breakdown was is normally it is the department's responsibility in the city to help, you know, put forward the the report that came out of the committee, which has been transmitted by the chair. So we will we will tighten that up and provide some more of that assistance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've already had some of those discussions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Awesome. Thank you. And with that, I support moving this forward to next week. So we're voting today and having a fuller discussion next week during such a conversation. Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. We have Dave Shukla. Time starts now.'",

Don't want to impugn anyone's intentions here. I just I just don't think this is the appropriate way to kind of implement a lot of the changes that we've been talking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'about. We need to be a lot more careful and deliberate, especially when it comes to California labor laws. Yeah. I mean, I think that that that this work really is the meat of what a lot of the community members have been talking about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's really for them to tell me their process. Not from me, but. But just. One last point. I, I really think it's important that this committee, the agenda items that are brought forward by council members, that we will really be intentional about how this is actually supposed to work with the committee.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speakers and control.'",

It refers to a special order that was issued on January six, 2020, and that become permanent policy change for the police department.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It sounds like tonight. You were saying that this is going to be discussed next week. Um. But the Council is being asked to. O prove this. Without seeing what the policy changes are going to be. I would think since January six, maybe there's been a change in what you were going to ask.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The policies of the police department be changed to. So. I will look forward to a list of this in writing which was not included in the staff report and. Hope that when this comes back next week that it'll be more clear and it be things that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everybody agrees needs to be changed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. Thank you. Councilwoman Fries, are you okay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to just comment on that on that. Obviously, the Public Safety Committee meetings are open to the public. We actually have public comment at them. And what happened at the last public safety committee meeting was there was a report provided on the special orders.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we did inquire as a council, I mean, as a committee to the city clerk, what the process for was to get the recommendation before council. So so we did what we were, we were told we were supposed to do, but obviously the special orders aren't included.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, they were discussed at the public meeting that is is preserved and can be viewed. But but I agree would be would have been very helpful to have the special orders. In front of us. I do want to ask the chief, is there somewhere that's publicly accessible where people can access the special orders and policies that's available'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on a public facing website?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, ma'am. Councilmember Price and the rest of the council members. I know a couple of times in different items that have come up. The question has come up about transparency for the police department. And I want everybody to know that's listening out there that all of our policies and the special orders that everybody's asking about are all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'available online for anybody and everybody to see. We're an open book so you can get on there. You can research with a topic you want and everything our officers are allowed to do or not allowed to do. Our is on our website.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please, when you get an opportunity, please read those. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Chief. And I did do something that I've done as a practice for several years is I do provide a summary of every public safety meeting to the council, the city manager, the city prosecutor, the city attorney, the the public safety chiefs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just so they understand what we covered in the Public Safety Committee meetings in case they didn't have an opportunity to watch those. And I did do that in the situation so that the council members, at least for tonight, would have that information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I knew that the the materials are available online. But if we could, Mr. City Manager, if we could please get a copy of the actual special orders for next week's meeting. That would be very helpful. And I think in the future, if we bring something forward from the Public Safety Committee, we would ask that city staff'",
        "'speaker_1': 'assist us in augmenting our recommendations so that we're not providing inaccurate information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly so, yes. The way we we like to support our council commissions, we we have somebody assigned to each one in the case of public safety and the police department. And we will work a little bit closer with you to when those reports come out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They really should be the city staff that helps to write that and then work with you to have that formally transmitted as the chair to the committee so that there's a record that we we provide all the all the backup documentation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're already changing that process for this particular committee, and we'll provide more support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. And we'll take note of that process for the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, everyone. The original motion was by Mrs. Brice in the second. Oh, excuse me, Councilman Richardson. I'm sorry. Vice mayor. Okay. So I understand this was this was a business staff didn't presented and it completely understood that it's going to you know, I understand Tom's response.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's going to make sure that, you know, all the committees when it comes to council, there's, you know, the legal review staff review it. It comes back under the title of the chair, but it's been vetted through staff and all the documents are there so that I completely understand.'",
