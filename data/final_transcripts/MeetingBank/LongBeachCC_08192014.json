        "'speaker_3': 'over to the clerk. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a recommendation to receive supporting and documentation and record and conduct a public hearing regarding the appeal of the Earth of Earth Justice on behalf of the communities for better environment, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Sierra Club.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to adopt a resolution denying the appeal and upholding the Board of Harbor Commissioners environmental determinations relative to the Metropolitan Stevedore Company Operating Agreement involving the Port of Long Beach and Oxbow Energy Solutions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Mr. Clarke, will you also administer the oath?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, please. If those intending to testify on this matter being heard by this council, would you please stand? That would include staff as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Do you solemnly state that the testimony you may give in this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cause now pending before this body shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Clarke. Now, I'm going to turn this over before we begin the the hearing and and kind of have our hearing and the and those that are involved in it speak, we're going to turn first turn this over to the city attorney who will kind of go over the hearing, the process of the hearing for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the counsel. And if there's any questions. He'll be happy to answer those from the counsel right now about the process of the hearing. Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Mayor Garcia. Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council. This appeal from a determination of the Board of Harbor Commissioners is somewhat unique in the experience of the City Council. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about the background of the actual approvals that the Board of Harbor Commissioners made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The scope of the appeal as it is before the City Council, the legal standard that the City Council would apply in making its determination on this appeal. The two options that are basically available to the Council when they're considering this matter and finally, the process that is allocating the time for both the Board of harbor commissioners and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the appellants in this case to make their case. So as far as background, on June 9th of this year, the Board of Harbor Commissioners adopted two separate ordinances. And it's typical, unlike the way the city does it for the Board of Harbor Commissioners, to actually adopt an ordinance when they approve certain types of agreements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in this case, the adopted ordinance number HD 2188 for the Metropolitan Stevedore Company, otherwise known as Metro Operating Agreement for the Pier G Dry Bulk Facility in the port. They also.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adopted ordinance number HD.'",
        "'speaker_2': '21 to 87 for the Oxbow Energy Solutions lease of the coal shed, also located at the Pier G Dry Bulk Facility as part of approving both of those agreements. The Board of Harbor Commissioners was required to make a second determination, and basically the determination in this case was made that for both of the agreements, they were both'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what is referred to as categorically exempt from the requirements of sequel. And with respect to the coal shared approval, they made an additional determination and an alternate determination that since there had previously been a negative declaration adopted in connection with the approval of the construction of the that coal shed, that there was no additional environmental review required'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So subsequent to those approvals and within the ten day appeal period on June 23rd, 2014, Earthjustice on behalf of Communities for a Better Environment, the NRDC and the Sierra Club appealed the second determination to the City Council. So that's the background and the scope of the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is really the one of the important things I have to say. The scope of this appeal is really quite narrow, and it only involves whether or not the secret approvals were appropriately made by the port. The city's charter gives the port the absolute authority to make a determination as to whether or not the agreements in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this case the operating agreement in the lease were appropriate. So those two items and what those leases contain or the operating agreements contain really are not before the city council tonight. It's only the issue of whether or not the sequel determination was appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as you're listening to all of the testimony tonight and ultimately when you take it behind the rail for deliberation, the legal standard that you apply, you make what's called a de novo determination, which means you are hearing this as if the board of Harbor Commissioners had not heard it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You are judging this on the facts as you hear them, and you're not required to give deference to the determination of the Board of Harbor Commissioners. The options available to the City Council after you've received all the evidence, are basically to, one, deny the appeal and approve the resolution affirming the secret determinations made by the board and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'making findings. And in that case, if you take that course of action, you will also be adopting a resolution in support of your determination in the findings. The second option available for the Council is to grant the appeal and direct the harbor department to proceed with appropriate sequel review before the Harbor Department reconsiders the two agreements that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we've been discussing. And now for the process, both the parties, the Board of Harbor Commissioners, and the appellants in this case have previously been advised that they have each been allocated 20 minutes to make their presentation, and they can choose to reserve any portion of their 20 minute time period for rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But neither side will get more than 20 minutes. At the conclusion of the Board of Harbor Commissioners presentation and the appellants presentation, of course, it will be appropriate to take public comment and ultimately bring it behind the rail for your determination.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to introduce here at the table, as you can see, the city manager is not sitting with us tonight. To my right is Barbara McTighe, who is an attorney in the city attorney's office assigned to handle port matters for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Behind me is Cathy Jensen, who is one of the outside counsel that the Board of Harbor Commissioners sometimes engages to provide secure advice to the Board of Harbor Commissioners. And Heather Tom Lee, who will be making the presentation on behalf of the Board of Harbor Commissioners tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. And so that said, as I indicated, we've allocated 20 minutes for each side to make their presentation. And I'd ask Miss Tomlin since she is making her presentation on behalf of the board. How much time, if any, you would like to reserve in rebuttal out of your 20 minutes?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My presentation is approximately 12 minutes, so I'd like to reserve 8 minutes for rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I'll ask the clerk if he would mind setting the clock at 12 minutes for the initial presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So with that, I think we've all will briefly see no questions from from counsel to the city attorney. We will open this hearing up and begin with the presentation from the Port of Long Beach. Mr. Singer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor Garcia and council members, thank.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You very much for the opportunity to address you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This evening. I am John Slinger, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach. My staff and I are here before you to confirm and defend.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The environmental determinations that have been made for agreements with two established tenets Metropolitan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Stevedore Company and OCS for Oxbow Energy Solutions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who operate a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Leading export facility. I would now like to turn it over to to Heather Tom Lee, our director of environmental planning, who will present our harbor department staff report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, John. And thank you, Mayor Garcia and members of the city council. As John indicated, the harbor department is before you this evening to respond to an appeal that has been filed not against our lease agreements, but against.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Related environmental determinations that were made by the Board of Harbor Commissioners. On June 9th, the Board of Harbor Commissioners approved two real estate agreements for the use and operation of existing port facilities on Pier G. The two agreements that were approved are an operating agreement with Metropolitan Stevedore for operations at the Pier G Dry Bulk Facility and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a lease with Oxbow Energy Solutions for the Pier G Coal Shed. Today, both Metro and Oxbow are operating on Pier G. The two agreements approved by the Harbor Commission on June 9th allow for the continuation of these operations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Pier G Marine Terminal is used for the storage and loading of dry bulk commodities such as petroleum, coke, coal, sulfur and soda ash. Dry bulk goods are delivered to the facility by truck or train and then transferred to covered storage facilities for later loading onto vessels for shipments worldwide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Metro has been under contract for years with the port to provide terminal operation services for all of the dry bulk materials entering or exiting the pier facility. This includes responsibility for unloading dry bulk materials from trucks and railcars and loading vessels under their existing agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Metro also controls the Pier G coal shed, which they currently sub assigned to Oxbow. Under the terms of the new agreement. The port would take back control of the coal shed from metro so that the port can lease it directly to Oxbow, thereby maximizing the revenues that can be collected by the port.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition, Metro will be required to carry out repairs and maintenance, including some repaving, which will bring the facility up to standards and improve worker safety. Metro has also agreed to green port programs to reduce environmental impacts, including assistance with an app birth and mission control technology, demonstration on vessels, installation of energy efficient lighting and the replacement'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of terminal terminal vehicles with zero emission vehicles. Oxbow is an exporter of dry bulk products and currently leases five storage sheds on the Pier G facility directly from the port and one through the SAB assignment agreement with Metro.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Under the new lease, Oxbow will no longer hold its interest in the Pier G coal shed through Metro, but instead will have a direct lease with the port. In addition, Oxbow has agreed to Greenport provisions to reduce environmental impacts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oxbow has agreed that its vessels will participate in the green flag and green ship programs and Oxbow will install low energy lighting for the coal shed, purchase greenhouse gas offsets for electricity use and participate in a vessel at birth emission control technology demonstration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now let me discuss the secret requirements under the new agreements. There will be no changes to the capacity of the existing facilities. The operations at the facility are the same today under the current agreements as they will be tomorrow under the new agreements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a part of the approval of the agreements with Metro and Oxbow, the Harbor Commission found the two agreements to be exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act or Secure Secret identifies various actions that require environmental analysis, but secret also defines the actions or classes that don't require further environmental analysis because they are not expected to result'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in any significant environmental impacts. Actions that fall into these classes, those that don't require further environmental analysis are identified as categorically exempt. A Class one exemption applies to repairs, maintenance and leasing of existing facilities when there is essentially no change from current conditions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And a class two exemption applies to the replacement of existing structures and facilities in the same place and for the same use. Since the agreements include leasing of existing facilities with maintenance work, including some repaving, they fit into these exemption classes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Therefore, the harbor department determined that the agreements were categorically exempt and thus did not require any further environmental analysis. Furthermore, the surgical shed was previously studied under a negative declaration that was adopted in 1992. Since a previous secret document was prepared for the coal shed and there has been no substantial changes and no new impacts and identified'",
        "'speaker_7': 'since the adoption of that negative declaration. The Harbor Commission also found that the approval of the new lease for the coal shed did not trigger the need for further environmental review beyond the previously adopted negative declaration. Now let me address a few of the specific points that were raised in the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'First is our requirement of a guaranteed minimum throughput or GMT. The new lease with Oxbow includes a GMT at 1.7 million metric tons of coal per year. I want to be clear on the purpose of a GMT. A GMT ensures that the port gets a fair financial return on the use of our facilities to move cargo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the calculation for a GMT payment is based upon the actual commodity moving across the dock. In this case, the metric tons of coal. The intent is to secure a fair minimum dollar payment, a return for our investment on the wharf, and cargo handling equipment like conveyor belts and ship loaders.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So despite the name, it's not a minimum performance or a minimum throughput requirement. The GMT requires that Oxbow make an annual payment to the port based on our tariff charge for shipping 1.7 million metric tons of coal. The guarantee does not require Oxbow to ship any particular amount of coal through the coal shed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In other words, if Oxbow didn't ship any coal at all through the facility, it would not be in default of its lease. Oxbow would simply pay the port the tariff charge as if they had shipped 1.7 million metric tons of coal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Most of our leases are structured in a similar way. GMT is are not new for the coal shed. In fact, when the coal shed first came online in 1994, the GMT for the coal shed through the Metro Agreement was over 2.4 million metric tons of coal per year, which was in alignment with the peak throughput at the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'facility that occurred in 1996 and is consistent with the working capacity for the coal shed, which is estimated at 2.3 million metric tons. It's important to understand that the GMT and the new agreement is not an increase beyond what has been exported historically through the coal shed or what Oxbow can export through the pure coal shed today'",
        "'speaker_7': 'under their current agreement. Finally, Oxbow is on track to handle 1.7 million metric tons of coal through the shed this year based upon market demand. Therefore, the GMT and the new agreement has been set at a level that is equivalent to the current throughput and will provide the port with a fair market return considering what is being'",
        "'speaker_7': 'shipped today. An additional item that was raised in the IPO is the repaving work that will be required in the operating agreement with Metro. A class to categorical exemption applies to the replacement or reconstruction of existing facilities. The replacement of over 126,000 square feet of the same type of asphalt, concrete, pavement, pavement and the exact same location'",
        "'speaker_7': 'at the facility clearly falls within the Class two exemption. This work is being required to ensure the structural integrity of the facility and to improve drainage to effectively capture stormwater runoff. It should be noted that the cout that Caltrans commonly uses class two exemptions for the in-kind replacement of millions of square feet of pavement, much larger than'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the work that's being done at the pier facility. I also want to point out that a letter from the appellants was received today at 1:20 p.m.. We haven't had a lot of time to review the materials, and but it doesn't appear that there is any new factual or legal arguments that are presented that would change our recommendation'",
        "'speaker_7': '. The letter states several times that there has never been any analysis of the impacts of shipping millions of tonnes of coal out of perigee, but that's incorrect. As part of the additional reference documents, we supplied the 1982 negative declaration that specifically assessed increasing the coal throughput at Pier G from 2.1 million metric tonnes per year to 5'",
        "'speaker_7': 'million metric tonnes. The facility is still operating well within that envelope. The 1992 negative declaration for the coal shed did not change that level of throughput at G. The closure did not increase the throughput, but rather changed how the coal was stored and closing it to help to reduce the emissions and help to make the train arrivals'",
        "'speaker_7': 'less sporadic. The train activity is well within what was projected. If anyone had objection with the 1992 negative declaration or the scope of its analysis, the time to challenge it was when that was adopted. The previous NEG decks cleared the way for the current operations that exist today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Today's submittal also repeatedly states that the port intends to expand the coal export operations beyond what is disclosed in the challenge agreement. The port has no plans to make any physical changes to the Pier Dry Bulk facility and there are no applications pending by any tenants to make expansions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The port is not looking at expanding the coal handling capacity beyond what now exists out there and is not considering any applications. The transit steam study was just an operating study and there is no plan to take action as a result of that study today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In conclusion, let me summarize the two agreements the Harbor Commission approved on June nine allow existing operations to continue and don't increase capacity. They will more fully realize the value of the port's facilities by directly leasing with Oxbow and they secure a structured maintenance and repair program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Board of Harbor Commissioners found the agreements to be categorically exempt from secret and that no additional environmental review is required. The Harbor Department respectfully request that the City Council receive the supporting documentation into the record and adopt a resolution denying the appeal and upholding the Board of Harbor Commissioners determinations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This concludes the Harbor Department's presentation, and we'll reserve our remaining time for rebuttal. And we're happy to address any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. We're going to have the appellant come forward. And also just want to make sure I just a note that as we go through these presentations and the comments, that we'll be respectful of each other. And so let's as you know, let's have a good hearing that respectful of everyone's opposing views, you know, and make'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sure that we introduce ourselves before we before we begin. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm just waiting for the presentation to come out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No problem.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll just start the introductions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We could clear a mr. Mayor, if we could please clarify the time set for presentation, as well as reserved for rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What. What amount of time are you keeping for rebuttal at the end?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're going to reserve 6 minutes for rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Bigot. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or they're going to. Are they going to put up the presentation? Perfect. Good evening. Mayor Garcia and members of the council. My name is Adrian Martinez and I'm an attorney for Earthjustice representing Communities for Better Environment in Sierra Club.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My colleague from our Justice Elizabeth Sites are also here. Also with me, we have Morgan Wian representing NRDC. And then also, Jessica, you're now a lawyer representing Sierra Club. And finally, Megan Krasno, representing Communities for a Better Environment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're very well represented as appellants. Tonight, I'm going to give an overview on June 23rd, 2014, Sierra Club Committee for a Better Environment and the Natural Resources Defense Council appealed a decision by the Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners related to two new agreements that you've heard a little bit about today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The main contention is that the Harbor Commission violated California's bedrock environmental law. The California Environmental Quality Act would improve the two new agreements without any environmental analysis. These are organizations and other supporters from other organizations, and residents will be asking the city council to send this back to the harbor department for an environmental analysis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This presentation, I'm going to go over three main issues. First, I will start with an overview of the concerns about coal and petcoke and the shipments of these products. Second, I'll shift to a little bit more information about the agreements and clarify, I think, some of the points of contention.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then finally, I'll go over the legal applicability of the California Environmental Quality Act. As his counsel is intimately aware, climate change is a serious issue and an immense challenge that we must take seriously. Climate change is caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The combustion of fossil fuels is a primary culprit in climate change. Fuels such as coal and petroleum coke are very carbon intensive, and as a result, there has been a major push to end the reliance on this fuel for energy generation in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As this has happened, coal use for power generation has has reduced, and tenants and coal companies have sought to export more of this product abroad. In addition to the global global consequences of carbon from coal and petcoke, there are local consequences throughout this process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Several environmental groups and other interested stakeholders have presented information. For example, we presented information about the consequences of coal dust that is shipped mainly when these cars come from the mines to the ports, they are transported in uncovered trail rail cars.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Tests show that coal dust contains arsenic, lead, chromium, nickel, selenium and other toxic heavy metals. In addition, coal dust presents several safety concerns. We presented various arguments and evidence about the impacts that coal dust can have on train derailments and other accidents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In addition to this, the ships, trucks and trains that help move this equipment emit significant quantities of air pollution. This counsel is intimately aware with of the air pollution impacts faced by its residents and Port of Long Beach is a contributor to a lot of that air pollution.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other thing is fossil fuel infrastructure poses cumulative impacts. This is a map from a an air that the Port of Long Beach did for the Thai grain terminal expansion. It shows other related projects in the project area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It identifies 79 projects, including several related to fossil fuel infrastructure, including about a dozen or more related to fossil fuels. This indicates the cumulative impacts of this project in addition to these many projects that will impact residents throughout Long Beach and also residents in the greater area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now that we've gone over some of the information that's been presented, I want to provide a little bit of context so people can visually see what is taking place down at Pier G. This is a picture of coal cars.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you can see, they're uncovered the coal gums above the top of the railcar. This provides another context where you can see into a little bit higher. And then finally, this gives us a sense of how long these trains are assembled.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as you can see, there's a significant amount of cars that are filled with coal. In addition, we've provided evidence about how much coal dust is lost along the way. And that was in all the submissions we provided.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now I want to go over overview of the agreement in a couple issues. First, the the agreement creates a guaranteed minimum of coal. There has never been an agreement for this port that specific specifies the product as coal being the guaranteed minimum.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is in stark difference to the prior agreements and anyone we've seen it was generally a guaranteed minimum of any bulk commodity. Here they're locking in coal second in year six through 15, the executive director of the port and his sole discretion may increase any of the commodities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So right now there's 100,000 per year cap on petcoke that could be increased in year six through 315. Third, I want to address some contention that people have been arguing that the guaranteed minimum doesn't really do anything. A couple thoughts we have on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One is generally you don't enter into contract terms that don't mean anything. And then second, an article submitted by the Port from Port Technology International States that these guaranteed minimums are designed to ensure tenants will use their leased facilities at ports to maximum possible potential.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the arguments that it doesn't really have an impact on operations are directly rebutted by the port's own technology journal that it submitted. Now I want to shift into some of the legal issues. And at the outset, I want to remind the council that courts have interpreted California Environmental Quality Act in the legislature as directed it to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be interpreted in a manner that's where the foremost principle that you should interpret the act to protect the environment to the fullest possible manner. So your job tonight is to have that in the background as you're making this decision.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are categorical exemptions where sequel analysis is not required. These don't apply here. The various groups provided several evidence showing that the various categorical exemptions don't apply. And then the other important thing is that when there's a reasonable possibility that an activity will have a significant impact on the environment due to unusual circumstances, exemptions don't apply.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now I'm going to go over why the exemptions don't apply. The first exemption the port relies on is a class one exemption related to a lease renewable, where importantly there is no or negligible increase in use. We provided several pieces of information about the increase in use and the desire to increase the use of this terminal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In addition, we remind that it has a specific amount of coal that's required to be shipped, which indicates an increase in use. Now I want to go over there's been a lot of talk about the historical trends of coal through the port.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Using the port's data that it submitted in its submission from Tuesday of last week, we charted out the levels. You hear a lot of talk about the 1996, which is the peak in that chart. The 1.7 million metric tonnes is the red line.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you can see, for the majority of years there has never been 1.7 million metric tonnes of products shipped through this facility. So what you're having is cherry picking specific dates to make an argument about the lack of a significant impact.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In addition, the port hired trans systems to explore how it can increase coal. The port is what it is it talks about how can they increase the shipment of this coal and allow for other bulk commodities to be shipped as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in addition, we provided in the record evidence from Metropolitan Stevedoring Company for Port of Oakland Application, where it talked about dramatic increases at the Port of Long Beach. The port is also claiming it falls under Class two exemption.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to remind a couple of things. This is a large construction project. It's a pretty large facility. There'll be significant emissions from construction equipment as this is done. And the other issue is that doesn't cover the agreements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the port is only claiming the class two exemption for the various maintenance. If the City Council determines that these exemptions apply. Sequel allows for exceptions to exemptions due to unusual circumstances or cumulative impacts generally. For unusual circumstances to apply must differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered by a particular categorical exemption, and those'",
        "'speaker_8': 'circumstances result in an environmental risk. There's environmental risks to shipping this material. You have train emissions, safety issues, ship emissions, and also the issues of coal and petcoke getting into our water and our lungs. The this also differs from prior examples.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The port provided examples of putting utility boxes in San Francisco, a case this is different. This is major industrial operations. It also provided an example of case law, talking about a 9000 square foot lease renewal in Pasadena. What we're talking about here is a 144,000 square foot coal barn and lots of major operations with trains, ships, trucks'",
        "'speaker_8': ', lots of emissions and lots of impacts. Now I want to talk about the negative declaration. There's been a lot of discussion about how this was adequate to address the significant new information about climate change and the seriousness of that threat that coal dust and coal's impact on climate change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The 1992 declaration is a 23 page, bare boned checklist document. It solely looked at the construction impacts from the building, the coal barn. What it didn't look at is identified in this chart. And there's a lot of important information that was not looked at in the 1992 document.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are important issues for people who came out to support this appeal, but also should be for the city council. Ten. I just want to note the issues discussed in this pile are complicated. It's a very complicated record.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a large amount of information that was filed within the last week. If you have any doubts here, the safest approach is to send this back to the harbor department for an environmental analysis. That way they can lay out all the information and have a period when all experts, residents and other stakeholders can weigh in on the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'impacts of this decision in a transparent manner. This process has been anything but that. I'll save. I have 6 minutes for rebuttal, but that's all we have right now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. And now we will have we will go back to the the first rebuttal. And I believe, Mr. Clark, they have 8 minutes, is that correct? Up to 8 minutes. Not to use the whole 8 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Cook. What was it? 8 minutes is up. Okay. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. One of the issues that was addressed by the appellant has to do with policy issues related to the exports of coal and the effects on on global climate change and whether or not it's appropriate for the United States to be involved with exporting coal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And while I understand that there are important policy discussions to be had on this issue, the matter that's in front of the city council today has to do with the secret determination for the approval of the agreements that the Harbor Commission made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the evidence that was presented by the Harbor Commission by the Harbor staff clearly indicates that CECA was conducted appropriately. The renewal of the agreements simply continues in existing use. There is no change in the use of what's happening out there from what they can do today under the current agreements to what they'll be able to do'",
        "'speaker_7': 'tomorrow under the new agreements. Therefore, there are no new impacts associated with the approval of those agreements. Renewal of agreements is listed as a class that's categorically exempt from Sequa. In addition, the repaving work falls into a class two exemption and is is commonly used for that type of action.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition, there was the 1992 negative declaration that was approved for the coal shed specifically and helped to establish the existing operation that's out there today. For any sequel analysis, what you need to look at is what will happen in the future as a result of the action that was taken.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And compare that to what's happening today. Today establishes the baseline conditions. These operations are currently in place today, and these agreements simply continue that existing use in the same capacity going forward into the future. There will be no change as a result of the approval of these agreements to the impacts associated with the operations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also wanted to identify the issue related to coal dust from the uncovered railcars. That, again, is something that's being done today and I think as clearly was shown in the presentation. Coal arrives at the facility today and uncovered railcars that will not result in any changes going forward in the new agreements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There will be no changes to how that's done and no new impacts to how that's done going forward under the new agreements that were approved. Therefore, there are no new impacts associated with that action. In addition, the operations at the facility are subject to Air Quality Management District Rule 1158 requirements, which do require that the railcars be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in in enclosed areas when they're doing unloading operations. There are water sprayers to help control dust and all of the operations at the facility are subject to that. AQ OMD Rule 1158 Oversight in order to make sure that the dust from from the coal is controlled to the maximum extent possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The guaranteed minimum. There's been a lot of discussion about that today. The guaranteed minimum throughput is not a performance requirement. It's a financial term that establishes a minimum level of payment that guarantees that Oxbow, despite how much throughput they have at the facility, at a minimum, they will provide a payment that's equivalent to 1.7 million metric tons'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And and there there is no requirement that increases the amount of throughput that they must have out there, that they they must meet a certain throughput. It's simply a financial term that establishes a minimum payment to the port so that the port can realize the maximum financial return on our assets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead. In addition, from a legal perspective, I'd like to just make a couple comments. There was a statement that to the effect that the port has suggested that the guaranteed minimum is meaningless. Obviously, we never have suggested that it's very meaningful to the port, but its meaning is financial rather than forced throughput.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was a reference made to the article that the port has submitted that talks about how common the GM 18 type terms are. And there was a reference made that those types of terms in facilitate the efficient use of port facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's certainly appropriate. The port is supposed to make sure that its facilities are efficiently used. That's one of the mandates of the California Coastal Act to ensure that the need for additional port properties is not a result of inefficient use of port property plus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition, as trustees of trust assets, the Port the Board of Harbor Commissioners has an obligation to make sure that the assets are being efficiently used and are producing a adequate return. There was a reference to the cherry picking of dates to try to have higher throughput.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We couldn't have cherry picked less on this because we actually provided information about the year this exact year, 2014, that in that year, in 2014, the throughput will exceed the minimum requirement by by some amount, but it's more than the minimum and specifically when you're looking at capacity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Class one and Class two specifically refer to looking at the time the lead agency makes its determination here. That's 2014 is the time when the harbor board made its determination. So 2014 is an appropriate year to look at averaging years as they do in the chart that have multiple years when there was absolutely no coal transport'",
        "'speaker_0': 'makes no sense whatsoever. Finally, there was a point made relating to the 1992 NEG DAC negative declaration not being adequate. The time to challenge the 1992 negative declaration if there was an inadequacy was in 1992 when it was certified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Secure presumes not only a protection of the environment, but there is a closure. It allows reliance on documents that have been approved so that you're not repeating the process over and over and over. With each renewal for an existing facility so secure opens the door for new projects when new facilities are being constructed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But once they're approved and the secret compliance is completed, that process is over and secure. Does not envision re-opening it unless there is a specific guideline that requires it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Time is up. And now the appellant's rebuttal, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The timer is set at 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. At first, I want to address the issue of claiming that we're raising policy issues. And I just want to be clear. The California Environmental Quality Act deals with policy issues. And what it does is it ensures that before an entity makes a decision to lock in 215 years of exporting coal as a policy matter, it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'has all the relevant information about the environmental consequences of that action before it. This is an important time for this discussion. If you allow this to go forward, this issue will not be before you for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The port's own submissions talk about the next lease renewal for a petcoke facility. Oxbow is 2019. We're talking about issues of climate change, air pollution that are that require action sooner than that. The other there has been some reference that the project can't be changed and there's one part of sequel that hasn't been discussed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We talked a lot about looking at the environmental impacts, but the other part of or the other kind of core principle is mitigation and what mitigation is. It helps protect residents when there's an environmental impact. It allows for you to change operations to ensure that the air is not polluted, the water is not polluted, and that you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'protect the environment and people from harmful port and other operations. So we contend that there were several mitigation measures raised that could have been considered for this project, including covering railcars and other kind of mitigation measures to reduce the coal dust.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The port has a greenhouse gas mitigation fund that is used for other projects, but by not doing the analysis, the port has failed to look at the required mitigation. And while there are some commitments to explore projects that may or may not happen in the appendix, there's no requirement for enforceable mitigation that California Environmental Quality Act requires'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Then there was a discussion of the California Coastal Act and saying that the California Coastal Act requires that they enter into this agreement. I could not I could disagree. I will disagree vigorously with that. There's no part of the California Coastal Act that requires you to pick winners and losers and pick coal as a winner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The California Coastal Act doesn't require this, and it's certainly wouldn't because it's counterintuitive. The port is going to be impacted by climate change. Their previous environmental review documents have conceded that it's near the sea. Sea level rise, they're going to be impacted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Residents in Long Beach are going to be impacted by climate change. So I think to argue that the California Coastal Act requires actions that harm the public, I don't agree. Now I want to talk about projected throughput. There's been a lot of discussion about 2014 being the appropriate year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'First thing I want to point out that we don't have 2014 data. The port projected out to the end of the year. These are months that haven't happened. So this is based on, you know, kind of myth. The other thing is the California Supreme Court has been pretty clear that when you have issues that fluctuate, you average'",
        "'speaker_8': 'not pick outliers. Here's what's happened is they've picked outliers and they've used that to inflate the numbers. And finally, I just to end and I'll end a couple minutes early, save us some time, because I know there's a lot more on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But a lot of people have come out tonight to support sending this back to the port. This is an important decision. And I want the folks who are supporting clean air to stand up to supporting, sending this back to the port.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you can see by the attendance in the room, there are a lot of people standing up. This is an issue of significant import for the residents of Long Beach and the residents of the region. So we're asking that you respectfully send us back to the port for an environmental analysis so that all the information can be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'vetted in an appropriate venue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And now we're going to be opening it up to public comment. I just want to remind you to please come forward to the mic. You must identify yourself for the record. And also just as a reminder that this and all public comment must be on the issue of the secret determination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what the public comment must be on. And the city attorney. What if we start getting off course on that topic? We will weigh in and the city attorney will weigh in on that. So please make sure you you stick to what is before the council and make sure that you also identify yourself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the record. And because of. We're going to begin we're going to begin the process. And if we start continue to hear the same information, we begin with 3 minutes. We may then limited to two, depending on how the flow of the hearing goes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're beginning off with 3 minutes for speaker.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia and Council Members James Callahan, Chairman, President, CEO, Nautilus International Holding Corporation, which holds Metropolitan Stevedoring Company 72 East Street, Wilmington.

        "'speaker_9': 'Metro started operations in the Port of Long Beach over 90 years ago, and we have operated the port's dry bulk terminal on Pier G for more than 50 years. During that time, the City of Long Beach has wisely balanced environmental considerations with economic vitality to carry forth its mandate as one of the world's great ports.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The matter before you this evening appropriately allows the continuation of a long existing operation that is vital to the local economy. Total payroll and benefits exceed $20 million annually for Metro's administrative staff. Longshore labor through the ILWU and Mechanics.'",

I'm also speaking as a impacted member of the harbor community and all sorts of Sierra Club member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have heard and you've seen the fact that the negative deck was prepared in 1992 and it was 32 pages long. It would never meet today's standards in the state of California. You saw that the train cars are.'",

It's been tested on over 40 ships, bulk loading ships, oil tanker ships and container ships. It's been a complete success and they've been operating here at the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we have a situation here where you need to use common sense. And that common sense is that prior to 2000, the truth of the matter is there wasn't that much of an educated public that know too much about environmental law, environmental requirements under sequa about port of Long Beach operations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that has completely changed since 2000. There are thousands of Long Beach residents, more thousands of residents in the harbor area who do no school. Law school requirements have studied the Port of Long Beach and its past year and its historical record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And our organization has always committed and about 80% plus about Port of Long Beach projects. But we have always proposed that there be an environmental assessment and we support the fact that there should be an environmental assessment done on this project.'",

It still be it will still be having VLCCs coming out of it, so it will be arriving and impacting all around the routes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have members in over 25 cities in L.A. County who will be impacted by the future and continue operations of this company and its failure to incorporate new technologies. So in that environmental impact, it needs to assess all the emissions, not only from the train locomotive engines, but from all the PPM, dust and the VOCs coming out'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the product as well as the ships. You need to do a health impact assessment to determine what has been the health impact to the public and to the residents. That has never been performed here. It was never even recommended in the past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But a health impact assessment has now been proven. That is a superior public health assessment tool. And so we ask that you include that document. There is also what's an assessment of the noise? Trains make noise. They also vibrate.'",

It was also before former then councilman now Congressman Alan Lowenthal became concerned about the transporting of coal into the port and the particulate matter involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some of you may remember that Dr. Lowenthal authored laws which required the covering of coal carrying trucks into the port, along with the covering of coal storage areas and conveyor belts. Unfortunately, railroad cars were not included in these laws.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I found them believable, compelling and valid. And so I support the appeal. And I know that if you think about the details and what's being asked, you will, too. We're not asking that these operators necessarily leave the port.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're not going to do that. So please support that. And finally, on a personal note, every day I find a nice little film of black dust on my patio table outdoors. All of you live in Long Beach, so I know your table must look the same.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we breathe that dust. And now I don't know how much of that is attributable to the port operations or to this specific operation, but shouldn't we find out? That's what an environmental impact report will tell us. Please do that.'",

Here I am here to to ask that the appellate be upheld and that a sequel review be held.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The primary justification that I have heard this evening from our friends at the port for not holding a sequel review is that nothing has changed. I heard that numerous times. I heard it in their original proposal presentation and then I heard it in their rebuttal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nothing has changed. Nothing has changed. Well, the climate has changed. And what has really drastically changed in terms of CECA and our need for this review are the impacts that we suffer right here in Long Beach, in the South Bay, in Southern California.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But there is one edict that I think we all must agree on. If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from it. Whether you are making your living from it, whether you're getting your nonprofit funding from it, if it is wrong to wreck the climate.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So many people have already spoken about it. The environment has changed the product.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My understanding that the product that they're moving has changed. And also the my understanding is that the quantities are changing. I may be wrong, but it seems to me that there's a loophole in there that over the years, at some point they can change the quantity of what the amount of coal that comes into the port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I ask you, I urge you to look at all aspects, all angles of this to find out any way that you can justify having.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The report done.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I live in what the port has designated as Area One, the most impacted area in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These leases do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Not minimize the amount.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of coal that can come through the port. It only minimized what they can get paid for the total output.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The way I understand the port's presentation is that it can go up to 5 million tons a year. The 1.7 is the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Minimum they have to go through, and that's the minimum that business members have to pay. But it nacht particulates which coal dust is directly impacts the children and the welfare of the residents of this city. And that is my most important recommendation for you guys to vote to send this back for school review.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to thank you for the opportunity.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Hello. I'm Joel Weinstein, 4000 Linden Avenue. I'm here to support the appeal. If you look at the requirements of sequel, no further environmental impact analysis was required unless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unless.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There were substantial changes or there were changes in circumstances or significant new information available. Now, this was not 1992. There's been tremendous new information available. Part of that information, in fact, is what drove the impetus to have a green port.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The new information available is of the entire area where we've been concerned with climate change. So I must ask those people who think we're setting a wonderful example for our young boys and girls. Do you think it's a great example for the port to be setting scofflaw example for doing the possible minimum instead of responding to the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'challenge of producing information in. In my career, I am always suspicious of arguments that we need less information or that we don't have to produce information even when the law encourages us to do so. I think you had better line up on the side of the wall and of providing information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You have had to do this to the point your predecessors had to do this to the port at least once. And I forget what the deal was, Pier J expansion or something. I think you'll have to do it again until they learn.'",

I've been a nurse for 31 years and I've spent all of it at Community Hospital of Long Beach, except for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the ten months that we were closed. I'm also a proud member of the California Nurses Association, National Nurses United, and we support sending this back for the appeal. Some people sometimes ask, why is the nurses union involved with the issues of dirty fossil fuels and climate change?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the answer is simple. When a child who lives or studies near refineries or export terminals comes to us with asthma, nosebleeds, headaches, nausea or worse, we care for that patient and we think this didn't have to happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When a worker is injured in yet another well explosion, we care for that patient. And we think this didn't have to happen. When a train carrying toxic carbon materials derails and sickens an entire town, we care for the patients and we say this didn't have to happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our nurses union has deployed registered nurses to the disasters that were previously talked about. Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and the typhoon that ravaged the Philippines. The nurses cared for those patients in the devastated places. More and more evidence links those and other weather catastrophes to climate change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We as nurses are very concerned about dirty, deadly energy sources and climate change because we see the tragic results up close. And we want our kids to have a good future. Also, the children living near our port areas already suffer asthma at double the national rate, and that will continue to climb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And coal dust escapes from uncovered rail cars and into our lungs and water. It is my commitment to patient advocacy that brings me here, and it is the same for all the nurses. My time is up and I thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The vice mayor here. Oh, say hello. And just to let everyone know when we go into the lounge, we have all of this piped in there. We can even hear it in the restrooms, even in the restroom. Since since the majority of the.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Their city council, their mayor, their port commissioners and the entire city. Okay, said no to Cole along with all the ports along the West Coast, up north in Seattle and Portland. They're all saying, no, they're fighting it tooth and nail.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'The pollution from this material is cumulative. We now live in an age where the accumulation is much beyond what it was back in 1992. Those reasons I urge you to grant this appeal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Hi. I'm Gabriel Weeks, resident of Long Beach. I am the volunteer chair of the Sierra Club for this city, the ones in the surrounding areas here. I came down here mostly to say happy birthday to Rex, but for those of you who aren't having a birthday, we could talk about Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I've been working with Morgan and Adrian talking to various port staff for a long time, and there seems to be a genuine difference of opinion between the attorneys of whether or not we have to do a sequel document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have to? Oh, we'd have to go to court to find that out, which way a judge would find. But maybe it would be prudent to do so even if we aren't legally obligated just to be safe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I get in the car. I don't think I'm going to have a traffic accident. I'm not planning on being hit by someone. But I put on this safety belt just in case we got in trouble in the city.'",

And second and PCH, the Home Depot Expo design, the attorney, the judge slapped that down because we didn't have a squad document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We hadn't done squat. So just to protect ourselves, we need to do that as a city and sequel. Do going through that process will give us a lot of information because I know I've met with a bunch of you guys individually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Patrick had some good questions. How much would it cost to cover the cool cars if that were done voluntarily by the Cole companies? Would the litigants drop any proceedings?

        "'speaker_0': 'make our lives and our our air cleaner for all of our families. So please send this back, have the port, just take another look at it, be a little more thorough so we all know what it is we're getting into with these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Gabrielle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Ruben Garcia. I am the president of Advanced Cleanup Technologies and also the managing member of Advanced Environmental Group. We are a technology based company based in Carson, California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here tonight to speak to you and to give you a very brief story. And on behalf of Metro, I'm here to support Metro Knoxville. And I just would like to share something very, very briefly. We started developing this technology in 2004.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This technology is in emission control technology to capture emissions from ships and locomotives. It wasn't well-received in 2004. And so we were able to partner with Union Pacific Railroad, several of the air regulators and some of the environmental justice community groups.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The idea was to capture emissions from these moving locomotives in Roseville after a successful demonstration at the end of 2006. The idea was to move this technology down to the port of Long Beach or Los Angeles and continue the testing on ships.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the idea is to capture emissions from non stationary sources. After looking around for several partners in several shipping companies and terminal operators that would help us, we found none. There's only one company that stood up and stood up to the to the idea that this may be a good technology in the fight for clean air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Metro has been a true partner. Not only did they let us test this technology on their dock, but they organized several vessels. To date, we've tested on over 50 ships and continue to do our testing. We're just about ready to be CARB approved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This will not happen without the support of metro ports in their forward thinking with respect to the environment. I urge you tonight to consider this and to support Metro. I also want to note that Oxbow has been a leader and has been helpful to us and also providing the leadership and other facilities, not just this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, I want to note that it took me ten years to get this certification done. So I will note that the city and the port of Long Beach does not take these matters lightly. And if you can get approved in the port of Long Beach and the great work that the environmental staff has done under their leadership'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I can tell you that you will. Your technology works. Thank you very.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, Honorable City Council members. My name is Peter Santillan, business manager of Labors Local 1309 and tonight I'm here in support of my brothers and sisters from the IOW. And I am I hear the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I hear the concerns. I also heard the report from staff. And while I'm here, strongly urge you to adopt a resolution denying the appeal of holding the Board of Harbor Commissioners environmental determination. I want to ask that staff continue to work with the community, find ways of possibly addressing the issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But nevertheless, I'll make it short and to the point I urge you to adopt a resolution and approve the leases. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. My name is Morgan Wian. I'm an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, one of the appellants this evening. Thank you for holding this hearing. I want to speak on a few issues. First, I want to just note that we cannot look at this in a vacuum.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just by opening up the newspaper. We can see the coal industry wants to increase export of coal from U.S. ports. There is no doubt that we will see an increase from Oxbow in others at perigee and desired increase of along ports across the coast.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because the port entered this agreement that locked us in for 15 more years of coal. We will not have another chance to even consider this issue to consider coal exports. Now is the time. Second, on the issue of the appropriate baseline, determining the proper baseline is a complicated legal question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are countless court cases only about the issue of what is the proper baseline. The fact that we are having a debate about this is just another example of why you should send this back to the port for a proper sequence analysis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In my view, we cannot use the ports projections for the next several months as a baseline in a cycle analysis. Third, on the guaranteed minimum issue, whether it was written merely as a financial mechanism doesn't really matter. What matters here is the functional result of this part of the contract and the functional result.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The result is that we can expect at least 1.7 million metric tons of coal, which is more colvin the port has exported for the past several years. 1.7 million tons is an increase. Fourth. Aside from the baseline question, a key question here is whether this is the kind of thing that was meant to be exempt from CEQA'",
        "'speaker_5': '. It's a very simple question and the answer is no. This is just too big of a deal. Coal dust, greenhouse gases, we know we know a lot more about this than we did when I was just a little kid in 19.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was just born 82. And in 1992, we know a lot more. The port, the port locked us in the 15 more years of coal, and they did it blindly with basically no information of the consequences. You should send it back to make an informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker. And and before we before we speak, I'm going to close the speakers list and there's someone else is going to that's getting in line that is not in line. That speaker is going to be closed with the last person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So please get in line because I am going to close the speaker list right now. So the line doubles again. Okay. And okay. So I don't know the person that in the last person in line with Alex Charron will be the last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the speaker's office is closed after Alex Stern is the last speaker. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is this was Rosemont. I'm one of the 31 union employees at Oxbow. I could be an employee for 18 years. I worked there for 12 hours. So 18 years of experience. I've seen a lot of changes there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Everything's been for the better. They have a great track record. They have a strong workforce, an experienced workforce. Most of Oxbow employees have been there for ten plus years. I worked 12 hours a day. I have a clean bill of health.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't have asthma. I'm not diabetic. And I work 12 hours a day. Oxbow held to a higher standard that we can. We keep our facilities clean. We have a high. What we see are a community drive by piece of mind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I know our facilities are always clean, spotless. And I'm here to say, please allow me to be the sole provider for my family for 15 more years. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Please. No, no yelling out in the audience, please. I've asked for us to be respectful of our speakers, regardless of who side they're on. Please, sir.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And city council members. My name is Steve Cannon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm also in play for Oxbow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've been working there for 14 years. The environmental cleanliness has increased drastically since my employment in the last 14 years. I heard one of the persons say that getting rid of the coal would not lose any jobs. It's going to lose my job and my coworkers jobs and makes me upset.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I have to fight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Pay my employer for my wages when I'm negotiating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I had to fight environmental people to leave my job alone. And I wanted. I want you to deny the request for the sequel. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. City Council members. My name is Bobby Olvera Jr. I'm a proud resident of downtown Long Beach, 1200 East Ocean, and I'm currently the president of the ILWU Local 13. Five months ago. I'm an advocate for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Five months ago, I wasn't in a tie in a suit. I'm not really comfortable in it tonight. But five months ago I was working in the tunnels down to the cocaine. I was shoveling coke off the rails. And 40 years ago, I watched as my father came home from working at the Coke docks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The improvements that have been made, the improvements that are included in this appeal or this this lease, they're doing this for the betterment of the community. The workforce down there in the union have worked hand in hand with the employer to mitigate any types of air quality problems.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We put in higher sprinklers. They require cars to be hosed off before you exit the terminal. So what we're doing here tonight is we're not here to talk about social issues because there's a lot of social issues and it becomes a myriad of hypocrites.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we're here to do tonight is to deal with the lease of the existing operation and to lay some new concrete in an existing spot. Nothing new, nothing more. We all know that there's problems around the world. That's not what you're here tonight to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Brothers and sisters of the board and Mr. Mayor, you're here tonight to consider this lease, which has been thought out, work through by the Port and the Harbor Commission through counsel, not to minimize the worries of the environmentalists or my fellow residents in Long Beach, for those of you that are residents of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But what you have here is the cleanest terminal. We've got a terminal on Stockton, California, that has open bars, that uses bulldozers outside. That's not clean. And they're working on that. They're making improvements. But here in Long Beach, it is growing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I've issued each one of the city council members and yourself, Mr. Mayor, a detailed letter. I didn't want to regurgitate it to you tonight, but I was working there five months ago. My son, my house. I look outside my back patio every morning and I can see the coal burn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can see the big blue barn. And I take my son outside and we play. And I'm comfortable with that. I'm comfortable knowing that I'm putting these brothers and sisters to work up there and that even with companies that I don't agree with, like Savage, I'm putting those brothers and sisters to work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So please uphold this lease and deny the appeal in front of you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sam Snook. It's Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, I want to thank you first for your patience. I saw some of the stuff that was going around on around measure and your cents. And it's to your patience and to your foresight on this that I appeal to and folks have talked about 1992 is a long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't believe at that point I was three. So we have literally a generation between the negative declaration, the conversation we're having this evening. With that in mind, AB32 wasn't on the books a generation ago. The Coalition for Clean and Safe Ports wasn't working on trucks a generation ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Measure and wasn't law. A living wage for hotel workers wasn't law in Long Beach a generation ago. And it's to your foresight, foresight, the foresight of people like you and the foresight of yourselves that these things came to pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I appeal then to that foresight. And so that patience to kind of just push this back the cycle which exists to make sure these things work. And when it does and I'm sure it will, because as folks have said, Long Beach, it has a world class reputation for for being committed to zero emissions and to clean'",
        "'speaker_2': 'energy. And so community responsibility. One, this does come back and is approved. Then we'll talk about it again. Again, I appeal to your patience, which I've seen in good measure and to your foresight in making sure that Long Beach remains committed to being the cleanest and greenest port on the West Coast.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Mark Lopez. I'm with East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, also a resident of East L.A. And in 1992, I was seven years old, playing soccer and baseball at the park by my house. Right. The same park that my daughters are going to play, soccer and baseball.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, when I was sitting there, I wasn't even going to testify, but just hearing a lot of information, I had to come up here. So I was thinking about my daughter, who was about two and a half years old.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so she's a toddler. She asks a ton of questions. Right. Her probably favorite question is, what's that? Right. She hears her baby sister crying. What's that? She hears her mom walking in another room. What's that? Right. The TV makes a sound.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also live about five homes away from the Union Pacific rail line that comes through East L.A. and the City of Commerce. And multiple times a day, the train comes roaring by. Right. We hear the engines. Sometimes you can feel the engines, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can hear the hundreds of cars that pass by, if not thousands, by my house every day. Right. They sound like this, right? Multiple times a day. 1 a.m., 3 a.m. all day. My daughter never asked, What's that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She never asks. What's that? She's become accustomed to it. Right. And the point of my story is, just because we become accustomed to something doesn't mean that it should continue to be acceptable. A standard from 1992 shouldn't be acceptable today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now we can all live here, write and communicate with the rest of Long Beach, the rest of the region, the rest of the state, and so on. And we can communicate that you are here requested for more information on the impacts of this project so you can make a smart decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or we can go into everyone you didn't want to know. Right. That's. That's really the decision that's here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker. Complete.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't support the appeal. First, it's an attack on the transportation of coal. Well, how are we supposed to get it? If I transport it to the coal is dirty. Well, so is the gasoline we put in our cars to go to our jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Three coal feeds industry. It builds. It's positive. And we have a lot of restraints on it now. Four We don't need more regulations. We're overregulated enough. It stifles industry. Six It's good enough for me to hear the environmental agency give out an award to those responsible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you next week.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council staff. My name is Jeremy Harris, senior vice president at Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce here tonight to speak on behalf of the chamber and urge you to support the staff recommended position to deny the appeal and uphold the Board of our Commissioner's environmental determinations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An interest of time. I'll keep my comments short, as we've already heard a lot tonight. As you're aware, Metro and Oxbow have been operating the port for decades. Their agreements were approved by the Board of Harbor Commissioners simply to extend their current operations and improve that financial arrangement with the port in order to keep business moving at'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the port. This is much needed in order to keep those high paying wage jobs and the economy moving down there. So in the interest of time, I ask you to support the staff recommended position allow you for our comments in tonight's record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. City Council. My name is Al Sattler. I first would like to say I received an email from John Moreland and he said he had submitted it, but he wasn't sure it was going to be in the record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would like to hand this off a hard copy. And he did specifically say that he believed the Harvard Department did not adequately analyze the new environmental impact of the new agreement, and it did not address impacts not analyzing previous environmental documents for the facility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And he has a number of pages here also like to show you, for those who haven't been down to look, this is another look at what coal trains can look at the various coal cars heading off into the distance, probably 100 cars in that in that train.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The air if if there is no environmental review of this project, see no evil, hear no evil, speak to evil. It's it's not good. And I also would like to point out to you the most recent issue of Nature magazine just came August 14th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is an editorial in here from a scientist from China who is saying China should aim for a total cap on emissions. And he is pointing with concern to the possibility for up to 100 million tons of coal per year from the Pacific Coast.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should not be part of that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Please, if if the line can move forward. And just as a reminder, the speaker's list is closed. There are no more public public speakers after. I believe it's Mr. Chairman in the back. Please, sir.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And City Council. My name is Hans Relman. I'm a member of the Sierra Club.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The coal business is a worldwide business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the Port of Long Beach is part of that business. And whether you're mining or shipping or burning coal, you're involved in a environmentally very dangerous process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the city of Long Beach should have its eyes wide open when it makes a decision to continue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What what's been been going on for a long time. So I am very much in favor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of an environmental review. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's bigger.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello, I'm Jeannie Williams from the eighth District. I'm also secretary. They lost Cerritos Neighborhood Association and we represent 1000 homes just like you were and elected officials of our group.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Made a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be in favor of doing this. So you're in favor of the appeal. A second thing I want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bring up that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, did I say we represent like 1000 homes, you know, so that could be. Yeah. Three, 4000 people. L cne so. Second thing I want to bring up to you real quick is that I've been working with Adriana and work and I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Am incredibly impressed with her knowledge of the law, how articulate they are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And how they have cooperated for years with the port already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know all that. Well, let's get to the sequel, though. Oh, well, what we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Discussed, the reason I came at the end and what I won't discuss. I think we've already reached the conclusions that the port is green, that the stevedore docks were pro-environment. And I have to say that when they're forced to be by law, that the city council overwhelmingly over the years is going to the direction of being pro-environment'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And that sequel will not eliminate jobs. Let's talk about secure. As far as I've learned, the people that do the environmental report are support. Am I incorrect? Like, if if it gets approved and you have to do a secure the port does it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So then you've got to say, okay, three points here I want to bring up just really quick to you. Why would they not want to do it? You have one cost. Okay. So cost equals how many babies, how many children with asthma, you know, should die?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How does that equal anything? Second thing is, something's hiding. You know, this would bring transparency to all of us and put us all at rest. The third thing is that the Koch brothers, all of them are known are known for hating regulations of the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One point the final point, here you go. Last sentence and I get this from the press telegram today. I'm plagiarize a little bit and I'm paraphrasing a little bit is that if you show favoritism and you circumvent the law talked about this, you make the laws laughable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity. My name's T.L. Garrett. I'm with the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association. I'm here to support the staff's determination that the category one in the Category two categorical exemptions or the appropriate level of psychoanalysis for this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that's the case, and I believe you should deny the appeal. The only issue I have that I would also like to raise is the potential precedence that this action could raise. If every time a lease is opened that it's a do over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Situation, it will create tremendous uncertainty within the business community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And will result in chaos. So I urge you to deny this appeal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please. I know I've said it many times, but let's be respectful of both sides of the people that are at the comment. They're here to give. They get their 2 minutes, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And City Council. My name is Jessica Yard. All Laurie. I'm an attorney for and a member of the Sierra Club. I want to address a couple of quick issues in addition to my my wonderful co-counsel from Earthjustice, NRDC and City.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This issue is one about transparency and simply conducting a requisite and required study under. See what the legal review does not shut down the facility. It does not stop exporting any of these commodities. It is simply a study to figure out who is impacted and what the impacts might potentially be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition, you know, if if this decision stands, it stands with the port turning a blind eye to the myriad of impacts folks have talked about here this evening. I also want to talk about the context in which this is occurring and give you a snapshot of what's happening on the West Coast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The port, if it upholds and requires Sequoia for this decision, stands in very good company. The Oregon Department of State Lands actually just rejected a permit for the export of coal. Just yesterday in Oregon, the Port of Oakland rejected flat out a new coal export facility in Oakland as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Oakland City Council has also expressed severe concerns with the transportation of coal and other fossil fuels. More importantly, on the issue of environmental analysis in Washington, there are two large coal export facilities currently undergoing a joint NEPA and CPO, which is the Sequoia equivalent in Washington Review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's simply a study. These studies, if you do them right and you do them in depth, they do take some time. This one actually is a fairly easy thing for for the city council to require just going back and doing an initial analysis that's not much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In addition, I believe the gentleman before me just said, well, what about the precedent this sets? What does this do for other commodities? The answer is coal and fossil fuels are unique. I mean, there is a unique impact here and one that has to do with climate change, coal dust, air pollution and a number of issues that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the folks that our community all along the rail line, from the mine to the port, the port to the plant in China, that need to be analyzed. We can't simply turn a blind eye to all of these things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I urge the Long Beach City Council to stand with with the other city councils along the West Coast to require this analysis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Honorable Mayor and City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm speaking to you tonight in support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of this appeal. I'm a 13 year resident and business owner in District one, the Linden Historic District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me, ma'am. Can you state your name for the record, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I beg your pardon, Pamela Kelly. At the end of June or the beginning of July, I started noticing that I had shortness of breath and that the air was dirtier than usual. A little while later, maybe around July the seventh, on a monday night, when I was driving home from teaching at UCLA Extension, I was stopped at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the red light at PCH and Long Beach Boulevard. I wasn't thinking about anything in particular. I just gazed out the window and I looked at the street light and I noticed what looked like a shimmering blanket suspended in the air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd never noticed it before, and I was startled by it. It was eerie looking. I shared that with my husband when I returned home and later with my city councilwoman Gonzalez at a neighborhood meeting on July the 18th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That meeting also happened to be out of doors, and I started feeling the shortness of breath during that meeting as well. I bought three air purifiers, which help, but they don't dust my furniture, which is constantly dusty. And again, I'm here and supported this appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I thank you for your generous listening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me. Honorable Mayor. City and mayor. City Council, city staff, simple citizen. I support this appeal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please give your name for the. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me. My name is Peter Rosenwald. I support this appeal. During the rebuttal by the city attorney. I believe she said that there was no change, nothing was different in terms of use. Well, I just want to say, I believe that there is something different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that this is these are pictures which I believe all of you have seen of the work of the operation near the port. And when I gave these to the city clerk so that he can send them around to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had a conversation earlier today with Mr. Art Wang, the assistant director of communications for the port. And my question was, what happens to all the water that they use that they washed down the trucks with the area that has called dust?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the answer he gave me is there's $1,000,000 catch basin, a million gallon catch basin, a pure G to stop rainwater or any other water from running into the ocean. Metro stevedore who uses the water in its catch basin to suppress dust and keep the terminal clean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have you actually looked in to see where this water goes, where it'll be used, where it's ultimately recycled? I think that that those are very important questions. I did call the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and I wasn't able, because of the lateness of this, to get an answer from them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think that this decision, if you don't support the appeal, that you will put this off so that more investigation can be done about the environmental effects. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. And our final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and members of the City Council. My name is Alex Charron, and although I represent Metro Ports, I'm here tonight in my capacity as a lifelong resident of the city of Long Beach and as a father of two children living proudly in the seventh District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The very first question you were asked tonight in public comment was who believes in clean air? Well, here's my scorecard. Metro Ports. Metro Ports believes in clean air at a time when the active system couldn't find a home and the saw kind of stack technology had no investors, metro ports stepped up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It wasn't easy financially or operationally, but they did because Metro believes in clean air. The Port of Long Beach believes in clean air. I know of no other agency, public or private, that has invested as much capital in cleaner technologies and been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recognized for it as the Port of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach. But they did it because they believe in clean air. The Harbor Trucking Association, who I represent, who eight years ago because the port asked them to invest in 1 billion with a B $1 billion of their own money in clean trucks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It wasn't easy, but they did it because they believe in clean air and they support these leases. Lastly, the ILWU. With all due respect to all the other public speakers tonight, nobody else is on the front lines. Nobody else knows the impacts, good and bad, of the terminal operations more than the men and women of the ILWU'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And they support these leases. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Okay. With that, we are going to continue the hearing and we are going to now open it up for council deliberation and action. And just as a reminder, the city council has two options in considering the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Option one is to deny the appeal and approve the resolution affirming the secret determination. An up or option two is to grant the appeal and direct the harbor department to proceed with with appropriate seek a review before the harbor department reconsiders the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as stated by the city attorney earlier, that was the the two options available to the city council. So bring this back and I'll start with Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I had a question for Mr. Mayes before we started this process. You talked about the narrowness of the issue before us. Can you please restate the issue before us?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're basically it's a matter of jurisdiction and the city charter vests in the board of Harbor Commissioners, the responsibility to make certain determinations regarding what activities can and should take place in the port. So it's within the port's purview to determine whether or not it's appropriate to either enter into leases, extend leases, modify leases, those sorts of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things by state law and by secure regulations. It's within the city council's purview to handle any and all appeals of the six determinations. So the narrow issue before the Council is strictly deals with whether or not the port applied the appropriate sequence standard when they determined that both the lease and the operating agreement were categorically exempt from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'further sequent review. So it's that narrow issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Price. See you back up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wrong button.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Any other questions? Customer Austin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know, first of all, I want to thank the many members of the community who came out today. I want to thank the port. I mean, this has been back and forth. And this is not going to be an easy call for the city council in any way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did have a few questions as I am deliberating my decision here tonight. And I wanted to specifically address the the the issue of capacity at the pier. And maybe somebody here can match from Metro or Oxbow can can answer my questions or the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Probably appropriate for this time for someone from the port to begin to answer the questions. And if they determine that one of the other companies can step in, that would be fine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as I understand it, there are at least four different commodities that are that are shipped out of the out of Pier G, export it. First and foremost, what percentage of of a business in a port is exports?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Somebody. Anybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of our total volume of containers and bulk products, 30% of our business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is bulk products.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. And I understand that there are four different commodities that we heard about, the pet coke. We heard about the obviously the coal. I know there to be there's sulfur as well as sort of ash. These are the major or main commodities that are shipped there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to tell you, I had opportunity. I've met with the the the in our DC and the coalition, Sierra Club Coalition that came in and had a great conversation a few weeks ago on the 14th floor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I made a commitment to, to meet with all of the stakeholders. I met with the Port of Long Beach. I met with Metro, with Oxbow. I met with Congressmember Alan Lowenthal. I tried to do my due diligence to get my hand around this, my head around this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I also went on a tour of pirogue. I got to tell you, I was a health and safety representative in the aerospace industry at Boeing for a number of years. I have a trained eye for for engineering and health and safety standards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I found that facility to be top class personal protective equipment was utilized. It was, in plain view, easily accessible. Everybody had on their hardhats, their stilettos, boots, hearing and breathing apparatus. They were they were dressed appropriately. I got an opportunity to witness the operations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I saw a coal train station. I saw where it it where the the the the the shower, so to speak, hits the train as it comes in. I actually saw the the the the apparatus that actually takes in the the train closes it it showers the coal and flips it and it sends it underground to a conveyor'",
        "'speaker_9': 'belt that then moves the coal to a to a capsule that that pushes it into the the the the shed, the coal shed in question. There was a not not a whole lot of exposure, particularly at the port.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so for that, I think the port operations is world class. What we don't have a handle on is the shipping of the coal, the trains from from across the country. They coal. They they they they mine in Utah and Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in talking to my congressman, he said, you know, and I talked to them. I said, you know, you you dealt with this issue early on as a as a state assembly member, as one of your first acts as a state assembly member.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it was major legislation because I lived in Long Beach a long time. I can recall, you know, the black dust. Yes, we still have it. And it's questionable where that's from. You know, it could be from our freeways and all kinds of other particulate matter that's in the air.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But in terms of regulating the the the the shipment of coal along railroads, I don't think that's personally in the purview of this this council. The second question I had is regarding the fact that I know when I was out there, I observed several other operators in the port and it pure gee, not just the operators in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'question, obviously metro there. But my question is, are there other exporters of coal in the empire? Gee. And I wasn't exactly sure of that. Is there any other organization doing that? Our company.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are none other for export.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the Indian.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. I have no other questions for right now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I, too, appreciate the work of both sides. You did a good job of outreaching and educating us on your perspectives. And this is interesting. I really think this comes down to and maybe you, Mr. City attorney, you can help me a legal question opposed to a policy question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The policy side is, should we be digging up coal? Should we be moving coal? Should we be selling coal? But the legal question before us is, I think you've kind of laid out is pertains to the school provisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that accurate? That's correct. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Turn back to you, Mr. Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, I want to thank everyone, especially those in the seventh District, who came down here tonight and speaking on behalf of what's taking place. Obviously, the seventh District is one of the most affected districts when it comes to decisions impacting the port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do have a few questions related to the presentations that were made. In terms of the Class one series of categorical exemptions. We're talking about a facility that holds well, that the minimum is 1.7 metric tons. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. The current the estimated throughput for 2014 is 1.7 million metric.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tons, but the capacity of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is estimated at 2.3 million metric tons. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You answered my question and that one in 1992, there's been a lot of reference about the 1992 study and how that was not also a negative declaration in regards to that. At that time, the negative declaration was obviously a different era.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I heard some some young, young people say they were, what, five and six and seven when they were 92 or three when 92 was around. So it's a different world, different time. Has there since then been any move or any any any consideration for doing an environmental impact study on those and also on that on the transportation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and storage of coal? At all. Has there been any any discussion about that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the Sigma analysis is required at the time that there's a new action that's associated with the with the facility. The 1992 negative declaration was for the construction of the coal shed. And since then, operations have been continuing consistent with what was approved when the 1992 negative declaration moved forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The action in front of the council tonight is related to the agreements that have just been adopted. That was a new action that the board considered. Those agreements are for the continuation of the existing operations as they're currently being done, consistent with the evaluation that was analyzed by the 1992 negative declaration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which came in the category in a class to cat category to appeal for for the for the exemption here. There is a talk about the replacement of reconstruction that's going to be taking place with asphalt. Is that is it normal for any agency that's going to do that larger replacement to go through a sequel or in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'air.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Class to you?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Exemptions are are provided for doing repair work replacement work in-kind in the same place. And so it the the asphalt repaving work that's being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Consistent with a class two exemption. Class two exemptions are commonly used for repaving work by agencies such as Caltrans for repaving work that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do on highway systems of much greater quantities than what's being considered here at the pier facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, the 710 repayment was that with that trigger, something that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_7': '710 project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is is a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Different level of project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a it's there's a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Lot of different reconstruction that's being provided with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If they were to do repaving in kind on the 710 currently a class two exemption could apply to that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Project is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is a different classification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Now I take it that the water Long Beach is not burning coal or pickle keep the same.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so if there are so what are the local impacts on the air and water in the storage of the coal in this facility, if any? And if there are, are there any efforts to minimize those impacts?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'AQ m d Rule 1158 was associated with minimizing the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dust.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And potential nuisance issues related.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The movement of these dry bulk products through the facility, including coal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Petcoke. Another other products.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The requirements that are established through that rule are being.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Applied at the facility to minimize impacts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That includes covering all of the storage areas and closing all of the loading and unloading operations, including water sprayers and closing all of the conveyor belts and the ship loader and all of that. That work and all of the facility improvements out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Facility are consistent with the requirements of a rule and 58.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, if I heard correctly, there's another 79 or so leases or projects that are in the pipeline for evaluation and negotiation. And I guess in along with that, would those projects also be subject to this type of evaluation?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was identified by the appellants was from the EIA for the high green facility that was recently approved. It was.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'In the area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The port, and each of those would be subject to their own environmental secure analysis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be handled independently.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would all be independent. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just to summarize into, there would be no president if we were to say. To accept the appeal, and it would not affect all the other projects. It would not it would not be president, certainly to have all those other projects also in part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Go through an appeal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Process automatically.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The list of projects that are in that Thai air are projects that are undergoing environmental review through year at this present time. And the there there kind of an apples and oranges type situations because they don't they involve changes to projects or brand new projects as opposed to projects for existing facilities where there are no changes being'",
        "'speaker_0': 'proposed. So it's kind of a different situation in terms of precedent setting. The you know, the granting of the appeal could potentially set a precedent of bringing all the lease renewals forward for new environmental review. That would be the precedent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I understand. So this is dealing with a renewal, not necessarily the new project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is essentially a renewal of a lease and a new lease, changing the structure of the lease so that there is a direct contractual relationship between the city and the lessee. Oxbow As opposed to Oxbow being a sub tenant of Metro.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'New York, which is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you all for being here and thank you for all the information. I just have a couple of questions. And, you know, we certainly understand the overall scope of this, but what we're presented here with is is very narrow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I just want to make sure I'm getting everything clear. First question, is the port director, he cannot just unilaterally increase the tonnage, is that correct? I just want to make sure of that. I mean, that's been a question that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. There. There is that the capacity of the facility is fixed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nothing in the action and nothing in the agreement modifies the capacity that is to estimated at 2.3 million metric tons. There is a provision in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The lease that identifies that there is a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A limit on the amount of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Petcoke.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That can go through the coal shed through the first five years of the of the facility. The executive director or chief executive can consider modifying that limitation on petcoke through the facility, but the overall throughput at the facility would never be able to go beyond the physical limits of the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Capacity of the facility. Okay. And then as far as a Q IMT and is it called a health impact reporter, what would it be called? The report that AQ, M.D. provides and how often is that reported? You know, it's two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any impacts. I know you'd mention that briefly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. I'm not sure I understand the question. I don't think there was a reference to Akhmed requiring a report. I think there are there is certain equipment out there that Akhmed does provide permitting for, and they have prepared environmental impact reports for various actions that they've taken, including the rule adoption of 1158.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they have studied the issue and taken action on their own. But in terms of the a reference to a report that Akhmed has prepared, there has been no reference to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So there's not again, there's just not regular reporting. I just wanted to get that cleared. That's. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's our understanding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, first of all, thanks to all those who came out tonight to talk to us and express our concerns about this particular item and also educate us on some of the broader environmental considerations in terms of coal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to clarify a few things with the staff before we conclude or go through our deliberation process. As I understand it, the issue before this body is as follows and that the scope is very narrow. And the only determination for this Council is whether the court decision regarding the second determination was justified based on the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'law and within the scope of the port's powers. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So the question really before us is whether the changes to this list fall outside of the categorical exemptions, thereby triggering the need for secure evaluation. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In terms of that, specifically, these questions would probably go to the port. We've heard and like Council member Austin, I too have met with all the stakeholders and attempted to educate myself on the issues. And I did meet with NRDC, Earthjustice and the Sierra Club and followed up on specific questions that they had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think, however, that there's still some a lack of clarity, at least in the minds of some, regarding two major points. The first and I'd ask the port staff to confirm this if I if my understanding is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My understanding, based on the documents that you've provided to us to review in preparation for tonight, is that there will, in fact, not be an increased capacity or throughput of coal. Is that correct? That's correct. That the GMT is not a coal throughput requirement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, it is a financial term utilized in the contract. Is that correct? That's correct. It's a requirement for payment, not a minimum throughput or performance requirement. And that there is no expectation on the part of the port or the city that there will be an increase in the export of coal beyond what has been exported in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'past or that is currently being exported. Is that correct? The at the facility, the current capacity is up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To an estimated 2.3 million metric tons. There's nothing in the agreement that changes that. The the facility could be operated in a way up to the limits of the physical capacity today. And they can be operated up to the limits of the physical capacity tomorrow under the new agreements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nothing in the agreements will change that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Finally, in regards to the categorical exemptions, the fact that the port is relying on, is it accurate to conclude that the improvements on the property, the improvements that have been discussed, do not rise to the level requiring further environmental analysis because they include the same type of concrete pavement, same location and done for maintenance and structural integrity'",
        "'speaker_5': '. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the maintenance and repair work that's identified in the agreements are replacements in kind for safety improvements and to restore structural integrity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And because of those two points, that's where the categorical exemptions serve to not require psychoanalysis. That's correct. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So. So would someone help me understand the connection here between uncovered trains and whether the sequel was whether we're required to do a report?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The question would be whether or not that's a new condition or a change in condition. The analysis that was previously done for the operation assumed uncovered. It has been uncovered, but. And in addition, putting aside the previous analysis, you're looking at a existing facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do want to clarify that we've had a lot of reference to the 1992 negative declaration for the coal shed. There's also the earlier analysis that was done for the expansion of the throughput for the facility, all of which was coming by uncovered railcar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it is important to note that the categorical exemptions are separate and apart from those previous analyzes. And the question there is whether or not it's an existing facility operating within its capacity or if the capacity is changing and that that is connected to the components that feed into that facility, such as the rail lines and their'",
        "'speaker_0': 'operation. So the real test is whether or not there's a change that is in capacity or from what exists now in order to apply those categorical exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so the trigger is is there a change?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a change as a change in capacity is a key issue? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And there from what I hear tonight, there's no evidence of a change. Now, help me help me understand the the pavement aspect. Does that present any change to the operation? Repaving the two football fields worth of asphalt?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It does not result in any changes to the operation. What it is, is a replacement in kind in the same location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. When I repave it, when we repave a street, do we do an environmental? Because I'm sure the streets that we've repaved in the ninth District are more square footage than this? Or is there ever a moment where we have to do an air on those sorts of projects because we do those like all the time?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there a difference there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, there's not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let me ask that. I thank the community for coming out on both sides. And someone said that this was this is a human element here. And I see humans that are impacted by this on both sides. And it's not an easy issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And although it seems like the question that's put before us is a very narrow question. A couple of things did come up that really concern me. I just think it's inappropriately placed here, you know, this uncover train circumstance that passes through all of our communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm really concerned about that. So my question is, what agency has the jurisdictional authority to actually do something about that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Surface Transportation Board. Its federal agency.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is a federal agency. That's correct. So has the city of Long Beach ever engaged this agency? Have we added it to our federal legislative agenda? Have we ever engaged on this issue?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not to my understanding. However, I'm not I'm not sure a city staff would need to advise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is anyone here? Okay. So. So, I mean, if it seems like when there was concern with the coal piles, we were able to work with our state legislators to to find a fix for that. And it seemed like here, if we really want to do something about uncover Coltrane's the appropriate place might be to amend our Fed'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Legenda or to send it to our federal or federal legislation committee to take a good look at it. Because, I mean, the question here is really narrow, but these are really juicy issues to to talk about. So, you know, at some point, I just want to say that maybe this is more appropriate there at Fed Ledge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I I'd be willing to entertain that conversation as the chair of our village committee. And then the last question I have is how many leases do we renew, like on an annual basis of the port? How often do we go through this?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a new lease with similar no change. How how often does this happen? Renewals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a common practice. It happens a handful of times each year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A handful of times a year. Do we go through this with with all of those? What's the difference between that one, those that we go through and this one? Is it the nature that this one is coal or what's the difference?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just help me understand. Break it down for me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's our understanding is the concerns that are raised, raised with this issue are specific to the export of coal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have there been any appeals on any of the other licenses we had in the last three years? Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not to my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Councilmember Andrews? Yes. Thank you, Mayor. You know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really I applaud everyone who's coming out tonight and the patient that you've shown us. And I've also had a chance to speak with the stakeholders. But, you know, I truly believe, you know, the documents to put it these cases, you know, I'm not a sick or environmental expert, but I do know that our port commissioners and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'port staff, city attorneys approved the documentation. And I think we're going to have to, like I say, give them time and know we I believe in it and I believe that it will work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with all of that and I know his time is very limited here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You guys and I would like to sit up and make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A motion with that to deny the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And affirm the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Decisions of the Harbor Commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, there's been a motion and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me. Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. Does that emotion include adoption of the resolution and findings that support the staff's or the Port of Harbor Commissioner's determination? Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So there is a motion and a second on the floor by Councilmember Andrews. Next is council. Well, I'll speak to the second and then Vice Mayor Lowenthal, Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank the so many people who took the time to email and dialog with us and come into our office on both sides. It's a great privilege and responsibility to represent people in this city and to have the opportunity to go to the facilities and see firsthand what the employees are facing on a daily basis'",
        "'speaker_0': '. What a clean and well-run facility. I was actually significantly surprised at the level of cleanliness. It it matches some restaurant kitchens in cities I've been to in the region. And I'm very proud of the work that you do here in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I support Councilmember Richardson in bringing this up in our Fed Pledge Committee. It sounds like there are some very. Thin requirements on what we are even able to consider at this time, and that we should be having a policy discussion about our role on the national stage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I really appreciate the continued education because this needs to be a continued dialog. It cannot be held in just one night. We need to have this over the next several months and continue this dialog for for years to come.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, wanted to thank everyone that's communicated with each of us here at the council. We like the other council members. I've had the opportunity to either speak with or meet in person with the different stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Regarding this item and the project, and your tireless effort to advocate your position is something I'm very thankful for. This Council doesn't come to these decisions lightly. We don't come to any one issue knowing more than any one of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so each of your expertize and passion in this area is something that I'd like to thank you for sharing with us. Your generosity of knowledge allows this body to do its job much better than we could if we did not have access to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the time you spend is tremendous. The second District, as most of you know, is straddled with a lot of the issues that have been raised today. Many of my predecessors, including Congressman Alan Lowenthal, has dealt with the issues and has dealt with issues on how to resolve the impact of port activity here, not only for the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'second District but truly for the city of Long Beach. There are always environmental issues that somehow seem to emanate from the second District, whether it's from the port or the coast, that both the second and third district share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are dealing with air quality issues, water quality issues. To that point, I wanted to thank the Port of Long Beach for its commitment to improving our air and water quality. I know that our harbor department is a partner not only with the city of Long Beach and its many departments, but really all its residents as well'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And we have seen appreciable differences. And while that might have nothing to do with the issue at hand today, I do want to point that out that this is a long narrative. We didn't come to this point overnight, but it is a multi-decade narrative that I think we're going in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As Councilmember Price very articulately highlighted, the issue here can be separated into two concerns. I won't go over the points that she made. I think she made them quite well. And our attorneys and staff responded to them. This item today, there's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is between two concerns. And I think all of us struggle with where we end up, depending on what we believe is the question before us. Is there a legal basis compelling the port of Long Beach and thus this city council, this body, to perform a square review of impacts from Metro Oxbow agreement, which requires them to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'carry out certain repairs, maintenance and replacement or materials and equipment in their terminal. I think the attorneys have answered that question as well as the staff has and through Councilmember Price's more textured questions under that, I think we have the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But for possible future discussion, I'd like to be able to buy for Kate the philosophical question, the environmental question. I don't believe there's a single council member here that does not regard him or herself as an environmentalist, as someone with regard for our environment, each of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We all have children. We all have concerns for all our residents. But we have a personal investment here. So for possible future discussion, as Councilmember Richardson indicated, we could take up the issue of whether the port and really the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The larger question whether we contribute to the global use of coal dust for energy, which has been identified as a contributor to air pollution and climate change. And we have to be able to separate that question. And I think that is a question that each of us wants to take up and can take up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a separate matter, though, there may be a practical connection between exporting coal dust and contract renewal. In my opinion, there does not appear to be a legal connection using the vehicle of an appeal of Sequoia, and not my opinion alone, but one that I feel has been adequately defended by our staff and city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The improvements being made to the existing terminal do not rise to the level of significant changes as described by Mr. Mays, and the agreement does not result in any increase in the amount of coal dust being exported. However, I do think the points that you've made are valid ones when it comes to the quality of life, when'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it comes to our sharing with our global community, a common environmental identity. And for that reason, I believe that this item should go to the Federal Legislative Committee, as well as the city's environmental committee, and can be duly addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this council can determine if it would like to make a resolution to that. And going forward and with that, I'll be supporting the motion at hand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So with that, there is no no more council comment. So there is a motion on the floor. And Members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Motion carries nine votes. Yes.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'Homeless Connections Initiative, funded by the Hilton Foundation. This person will also lead the city's effort to track, monitor and respond to chronic homeless. Working with our quality of working with quality of life teams, the Met Teams and the DOJ.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The funding for this position will be split between general fund and grant funding and approximately $49,000 each. Our issues and opportunities coming up. I had the opportunity to attend the mayor council retreat over the weekend and to hear about the vision for the city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'What you described really is a healthy city. In addition, you focused on collaboration as a mechanism to achieve it. Each of the departments you've heard from so far. Plus Public Works, Development, Service and Workforce have been engaged in collaborative planning to build the health of our city together.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We'll also be engaging in conversations and planning with many community partners who are engaged in supporting our city's health. And we look forward to engaging you in this conversation as well. Our Continuum of Care received the unified funding agency status, which will allow for greater flexibility in local resources targeting to address homeless.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We are one of only two nationally to receive this designation. The other being Columbus, Ohio. This is seen as a national best practice and they're actually turning to us to help them organize it and figure out how to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Move it forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Health and wellness. Health and wellness really includes being physically and mentally healthy. We're seeking to expand mental health opportunities in the city through work with new funding sources and partners. In addition, we're working to integrate mental health services into our clinical services to improve the likelihood that people will access them.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We've been participating in a pilot with Mental Health America as an integrated service model, and the early results are promising. We're looking to seek we're seeking to continue this model moving forward. Another key issue for us is improving the coordination of local data systems.'",

The stymies effective planning and Coordination of Service. The Health Department is planning to implement a common database to track health indicators in the city.'",

Research indicates the social determinants of health such as poverty, trauma, safety, education, employment have a significant impact on individuals and communities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In Long Beach, we have neighborhoods who are heavily impacted by social issues that are struggling with their ability to improve their health overall. A key challenge for us with our partners is providing the same opportunity for health in all of our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And finally, identifying sustained funding for our services. 84 7% of our resources come from federal, state and local grants management. Department of Programs. With grant funding as a primary source of revenue is both a science and an art.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thankfully, my staff have both of those skills. While some grants are stable and we've been receiving them for years, others are more project specific with limited time periods. In addition, we are directly impacted by policy and funding changes at all levels of government and sometimes with little notice.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'While we've learned to be nimble and do our best to maintain staffing and to maintain and grow services, we seek more sustainable funding solutions in the future. So each of our presentations so far have been framed as the public safety continuum, and we're so pleased to be part of it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But I'd say there were also our key players in the health continuum of Long Beach. Physical and behavioral health promotion is a crime reduction strategy. It's an education strategy. It's an employment strategy. Crime reduction, education, employment are also health promotion strategies.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They're also closely intertwined, although we tend to talk about them separately. Health, safety, education. Sustainable income, housing in place are keys to success of the people in Long Beach and Brenda one breaks down. The likelihood of success is reduced.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'When people are physically and mentally healthy, they do better in school, they do better at work, their families do better, and there's less crime involved to achieve a healthy line, which for everyone requires all of us. The partnerships across the city, our long standing, your Health and Human Services Department is a key resource for bringing and coordinating'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, members of the Council, thank you for the opportunity to present the water department's budget there. It comes for fiscal year 2015. And I would like to introduce the president of the water commission, Harry Salts gave her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was right up here with the bright red tie. So it's easy to see. Go ahead. In the water department, we have two separate and distinct funds. The water fund and the sewer funds are there. They're the. It's just as it sounds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The costs of the water fund are provided for by our water fees and the sewer fund. Likewise. So I'll cover the water fund first and then later the sewer fund. The water fund there. You can see on the the pie chart on the left is by far the largest fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It constitutes about 84% of our budget. And then the sewer fund, about 16%. And then you see the the breakdown of our major components of our water fund. So roughly two thirds of it is non-personal services or operation and maintenance costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'll talk about some of those on the next slide. About 20% is our personnel or personal services budget, and then our capital budget is about 13 million. Really, what's driving what's happening with the water department is really this slide is the key to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This shows you we get 60% of our water supply from the groundwater basin and 40% of it we buy from the Metropolitan Water District. And what you're seeing here is a chart that shows on the top what the rates we were charged by the Metropolitan Water District have done since 2008 through 2015.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what the the charges that we pay to the water replenishment district for the groundwater that we pump have done, and in both cases, they've gone up 81% over that time period. So the numbers on the top are in dollars per acre foot for those of you that are are trying to follow this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the graph on the bottom is in millions of dollars. So you can see and if you look at it, that basically those costs have gone up about $14 million. So while we've absorbed in some cases these 81% increases in costs from the Metropolitan Water District and the the water replenishment district, our rates, including the 4%'",
        "'speaker_4': 'rate increase we're proposing for 2015, have only gone up 44%. So we've been absorbing many of these costs and have been running a deficit budget for the last few years now. And so we came to the water commission last year into the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the next slide will show that we couldn't continue to run a deficit budget forever. We've been using reserves to meet this deficit. So last year was the first year of our five year finance plan on our water on our water budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This chart shows you the remaining four years with fiscal year 15, they're highlighted in yellow. The finance plan essentially accomplishes two objectives. By 2018, it would balance our budget, so it will bring our revenues and expenditures into balance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's right now unbalanced, as you can see, to the tune of about $7 million deficit budget in 15. And the other thing it would do is it would use our remaining reserves to to smooth those rate increases in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we what our studies show and what we did this year and what we're proposing, again, in 15 is that with 4% rate increases by 2018, we achieve those two objectives of being in a balanced budget situation and having our reserve level at the 11 to $12 million target, which is what the rating agencies have told us'",
        "'speaker_4': ', is the lowest amount that they'd like us to maintain as a as a reserve for our water fund. And so we have assumptions of continuing rate increases from MWD and the water replenishment built into that plan. And of course, if we can be successful at reducing those, then our future rate increases would come down accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But again, this is what's driving our our budget and our rate increases as these increased costs from MWD and the water replenishment district. Moving out of the sewer fund. We have a similar situation there. We were faced with some new regulations about seven years ago that required us and other water utilities or other utilities that operate sanitary'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sewer systems to greatly expand our sewer activities, both in terms of maintenance, cleaning, inspection and capital investment. And so we've been doing that now for the last seven years or so. So there you see the sewer budget broken down again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's heavy on O&M or non-personal services. And about a $4 million or about a 20% of our sewer fund goes towards capital improvement programs. Go ahead. The situation we're facing with the sewer system is so we've been in spending this additional money for the last several years now out of a line of credit, we took $20 million'",
        "'speaker_4': ', line of credit we opened several years ago. Now we've been able to extend that twice. It's a very low interest, a line of credit we wish we could continue forever, but it is going to expire in 2017. And so that's what's planned for here is in 2017 to retire that outstanding, outstanding line of credit and convert it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to a regular long term debt issuance where we'll have to be paying both principal and interest. So that's why you see a fairly large increase in our expenditures as we go from 2016 to 2017, almost $1,000,000 in increase as we start making principal payments on that line of credit after we convert it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again, we've got nominal increases assumed in our budget. And then again, what you see here is, is that by 2019, we again would achieve a balanced budget, our revenues and expenditures would be in balance and our reserves would be down to around $4 million, which is again the target for our sewer fund, for our rating agencies'",
        "'speaker_4': '. They'd like us to maintain about $4 million in the sewer fund. So that's so again, our forecast there is we need a 4% rate increase this year and then 5% rate increases each of the next four years to achieve those two objectives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go ahead. So what does this mean in terms of rates? Again, what we're proposing for 15 is a 4% increase in both the water and sewer rates. How does that stack up? Go ahead. On the typical monthly bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This shows are our combined water and sewer rates for a typical single family home in Long Beach. Compare how it's changed over the years. You see that what the increase there, the total increase the purple is the water and the yellow or gold is the sewer and it's against a 4% increase in total is $2.12 on the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'combined water and sewer bill. How does this compare to other cities throughout California and our peers in our in our area? This is the total water and sewer bill. And in this analysis, we also include the fee that our property owners in Long Beach pay to the sanitation districts through their property tax bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's a true apples and apples comparison because there is an additional fee that that's paid for sewer service provided for the sanitation districts. So when you combine that, you see how we compare to what's called the L.A. County Average, a grouping of cities in Los Angeles County, how we compare to other large cities in the state'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And then we also like to show Golden State Water, which is a private utility that provides water service in a very small part of northeast Long Beach. We provide their sewer service, but Golden State provides the water service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the entire difference there for the Golden State customers is, is their increased water bill that they pay to Golden State water. And I think I'll I'll conclude with a couple of comments that are that I don't think I should be here tonight and not talk about the drought and conservation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank the members of the Council for your ongoing support of what we've been doing in the law, in the water department and for what you've been doing in the community. This is a very, very serious drought that we're engaged on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've all heard that Long Beach is once again leading California through this drought. I'm sure you've seen that we in July, we reduced our consumption for water to the lowest level since 1958. We'll do the same again in August and we'll go for a three peat in September.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is a very, very impressive thing that the city of Long Beach is doing. I want to thank the council. I want to thank the city departments who are working closely on this. And I certainly want to thank our constituents who are doing a wonderful job of setting a great example for the entire state of California'",
        "'speaker_4': '. With regard to water conservation, we don't know how long this drought is going to go on. So the more we can save, the better we are. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And thank you all for the for the presentations. What we're going to do is we're going to first, I just wanted to make a quick comment. I just wanted to thank there's a lot of you in the audience that are either here for this or public comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you for for bearing with the longevity of tonight to this point. I also want to ask the heads of each of the departments one department head can each can take the mic so that when we ask the questions, it can go go smooth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So someone from water, someone for our public works at as well as our health and human services. That way the questions can be asked and we'll have a smooth process. And we'll start with Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I wanted to address the Department of Health and Human Services, and thank you really for the work that you do with the homeless program and operations that we have in the city. I was recently at a restaurant and a resident came up to me, which happens a lot more often than I ever envisioned nowadays.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But a restaurant. A customer came up to me, also a resident of the third and said, you know, talks about the homeless problem and the issue that they perceived as a problem to be near the Belmont Pier area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and said, you know, why are aren't the homeless and why doesn't cities like Newport and Corona Del Mar have the same issues with the homeless? And I explained to them that because Long Beach is not Newport or Corona Del Mar or Long Beach, and how very proud I am of our Health and Human Services Department and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'trying to work proactively and with the limited resources that you have to come up with constructive solutions that provide those individuals with options, choices and positive. Options that are available to them that otherwise wouldn't be without our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I wanted to highlight that and and say that I understand that you're working with a very limited budget when it comes to our homeless programs and the efforts that you do for that program. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of anything new that you plan to do in the coming year to enhance the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'program that we currently have?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We received the unified funding agency status, which is that for the continuum of care, what that will allow us to do is to be more flexible in the way that we the way we use our resources for homeless.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So as we see different priorities pop up, it will allow us some more flexibility in how we address those issues. In addition, we're working very closely, as you know, with the quality of life teams and with our met teams.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Quality of life is with the police department, includes an officer and a mental health provider to do outreach. So as people are seeing homeless and they're seeing situations where we ask that you do contact us because we will send outreach workers out.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the multi-service center is being it's under construction right now. It will open again in October. At that time, we will have our partners co-located there and we will continue to do all of the different services that we've that we've done in terms of helping people find housing and address their other needs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you for the work that you do, and we look forward to supporting you in any way that we can.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council, Councilmember Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you and thank you for the report. So I'll first start with Health and Human Services. Again, I have to reiterate. Thank you very much. I know we see the effects in the First District because we often see homeless individuals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And quick story, we I believe your outreach group took a family off the streets, a family of about four or five off our 14th Street area. So it was a huge deal to not see them, you know, struggling up out in the street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's just one example of how we see it every single day. So just in speaking with the homeless coordinator that I think you have proposed here, I know there's some reorganization within your department. Is that replacing anything or is that in addition or what what can we expect from or what is that position exactly?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The new position is in addition, it's not replacing replacing any service. It will this person will help sort of coordinate, exist, coordinate new programs and existing programs. They'll be there to provide greater coordination around outreach to the chronic homeless population and to work with that to work with other grants.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We see it as providing up to 2000 hours of extra outreach because they'll be sort of helping to reduce some of the other work of other people who are doing direct service.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you. And public works are a thank you for your presentation. I just have to say thank you for all that you do because I we also see the work, you know, in our district daily. And if I can just say one thing, I know it wasn't really touched on here, but just in regards to just'",
        "'speaker_5': 'privatization and inner city employees. And I know that it's it's really important, you know, in my perspective, to be able to identify other cost savings, to be able to keep our street sweepers, our refuse and other city employees, you know, within within the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's certainly something that, you know, I'm supportive of and just. Thank you. That's all I wanted to say.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also, actually, I think we love the street sweepers. Can they sweep our alleys? I know we talked about that, but that's something that always comes up. So I hope that, you know, we can certainly address that somehow.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'As we discussed yesterday at your budget presentation. By request, we will have streets. I mean, street sweepers will go into the alleys. But it's not a program that we have currently. But if there is a need, will accommodate that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you. And then lastly, the water department. I just wanted to also say thank you as well. I know you're great work. It's very progressive initiatives. Linda Garden, we, you know, handle a lot of that in our office, keeping our rates low and also being fiscally responsible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And and a question about cast iron pipes. I know that when do we expect to upgrade those outdated pipes or what is the process for that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've been regularly replacing cast iron pipes, which is our oldest pipes, which are the ones that are most susceptible to breakage since the early 1990s. So over 20 years we've had a significant program. We've replaced about half of them thus far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, the remaining half will take us about another 30 to 40 years. But, you know, so again, strategically, we've replaced all the ones that we've had problems with. As we talk with your office and particularly in your district, a lot of the ones that are in your district are in the alleys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a very difficult situation and a lot more time consuming and and expensive. But again, at the rate we're going, it's about a 30 to 40 year period before we replace the remaining little less than half that we still have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I want to start by thanking the great work of our health and public health department. For those of you who don't know, I started my county career as a budget, a budget analyst for health services, L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the work that you do is imperative. And I appreciate how thin of a margin our matching funds are against the revenue that you draw down. That's quite a testament to both our financial management division and your department to be able to leverage those funds effectively.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of my areas of concern is that over the last 10 to 15 years, mental health funds into the region have more than doubled, in some cases almost tripled. And our city has not seen that same gain in grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there any strategy that we could take in the next few years to better partner? I believe L.A. County has seen an increase from in the $700 million area, up to $1.9 million in terms of additional funding to the region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I recognize that a large portion of that is to deal with some of the issues in our correctional facilities. But there are a lot of correction facilities to community programs, as a lot of our officers will attest to, that we have many issues in pulling them out and back into society in a meaningful way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we working on that with our probation officers and our police officers? Is there a way to draw down that major funding?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. So there there are multiple different services in Long Beach to the Department of Mental Health from L.A. County, has an office here and they provide direct service. We're working very closely with them. Mental health America provides there are key partner with that with us in providing mental health services as part of our continuum of care and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'other services. They're also part of our integrated physical health and mental health program that we're working on in terms of working with our criminal justice partners. We are in conversation. We are we will be one of the pilots through the L.A. County Mental Health Diversion Program with Jackie Lacey.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we we have been meeting and talking about that with both the police department and with the city prosecutor's office to develop that model. And we will be working with L.A. County to look to move that forward. Our goal is, is that we can address those issues here before they end up in the L.A. County jail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please let me know how I can be helpful. Public Works. Thank you for your expedient response to the flood of constituent requests through the GO app recently. We've received a lot of positive feedback in the effective ways that your staff have responded to our graffiti issues that have recently arisen from some releases that we've had in the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'area. Could you give us a quick update on the Street Payments Pavement survey?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yes. Approximately a year ago when I joined the city, as far as being the direct, not the director of public works but the city engineer, my first vision was to update our 2005 payment management plan. We have already a consultant on board that have finished their survey.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We're working on the the implementation phase of it. I should have a very comprehensive plan for you within the next month or so. So after you're done with your major hearings, I'll bore you with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And will that comprehensive plan come with a dollar amount that would be required to move our current street conditions to a. More manageable scale of accountability across the city.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I will give you all that data in regards to where we are with the current index. How much money we need to spend per year to stay as status quo. And what you need to do to increase that index.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. I look forward to it. And thank you for your partnership on a potential program that we might be bringing to the fifth District soon. Related to pilot programs will add efficiency to our street sleepers while not outsourcing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My grandfather was a tree supervisor for the city, and I know the great pride that our community employees take in the streets that they drive down and that they live in our community and they care about our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We recently had a few calls for service, about one medium, and there was a a street sweeper, and he didn't he got a new route and he didn't know about this particular median and which day of the week it was handled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I thought he was very professional in his response to our constituents and they've given some great positive feedback. So thank you for making the adjustments to the route. And lastly, last week I made my first water waster app declaration, so I'm sorry to the resident who was wasting water, but you have been reported, I think that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'your app is wonderful. It is both creative and innovative. The kids in the community of our neighborhood association have been tasked as water enforcement officials and their parents have used their little not iPhones, but they play iTunes on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We call it an iPod there, their Wi-Fi, iPods to report. So you will be getting many reports from the fifth District soon as we have deputized a team of young people. And I wanted to comment on the lawn to garden program has typically been only for turning a grass lawn into a garden.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things that's happened in our community is we've actually explored artificial turf, and that's currently an expense that's completely burdened by the homeowner. I've made that personal choice to change over, but some of our senior citizens are less likely to make that kind of change because of the restrictions and moderate income that they're depending on'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so I appreciate the discussions we've had on a pilot program to potentially experiment with a lawn to garden option and was hoping that, Kevin, you might be able to let us know it would 90 days or 120 days be a reasonable amount of time to discuss the components of that pilot program so that our senior community'",
        "'speaker_0': 'could reduce their water intake without any changes to the Neighborhood Association's happiness with their lawns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh yeah. I think 90 days is very reasonable. We can put a pilot program together and have it implemented within that time frame, I'm certain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excellent. The senior citizens of my community. Appreciate it. Thank you. That I have no more questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Constable Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to be I want to be quick, because I know there's a number of North Long Beach residents here waiting for the council meeting to begin. So. So let's let's start with. Well, we have water just that just chimed in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I know with the scarcity of water and our our aging infrastructure and the increased price, you're hit with like a triple threat to your budget. So I'm happy that the the water water board and our president here's a ninth District resident Mr. Salts gave her.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm happy the water board in the last council took steps to ensure that we will have a fiscally sound water department that will maintain services for our residents and jobs, you know, quality, quality employment here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My question is really about the lawn garden program similar to Councilmember Price. So my wife and I, we just converted converted our lawn. We love it. It's low maintenance, relatively no water. But across the street from my home, the neighborhood across the street, they they don't have access to this program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we've talked about it loosely. But I wanted to just ask out in the open, you know, there are certain areas in the town who aren't you know, who are not customers of Long Beach Water. I know that a significant portion of our lawn to garden programs funding does not even come from the city of Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_6': '. What would it take to to expand a similar program to all corners of the city so that everyone can participate in this water conservation effort?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank thank you for bringing that issue to our attention. We were actually unaware that you have a small section in your district that's served by the other large private water company that does business throughout this region. That's Canal Water region.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was the Domingo's Water Company. So so those constituents are eligible to apply through their water provider for the rebates that the Metropolitan Water District has. So that's $2 per square foot. So they could do that today. They wouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they wouldn't go through us. They're not our customers. And it wouldn't be appropriate for us to spend our ratepayers money since they're not contributing to our revenue stream. But they could do that today through their water providers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And same situation with Golden State in the fifth District. If we wanted to do more than that, then we'd have to have some legal analysis in terms of who would be appropriate to provide the additional funding to bring the level up to the $3.50 that we pay all of our ratepayers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our ratepayers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Kevin. And I don't know that the pilot would necessarily need to be the same program as what everyone gets, but even $2 is better than better than it really. We want to make sure that they're included in the outreach efforts and ensuring that they are they should they are encouraged to participate here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what I'm really interested in is maybe a conversation at the at the commission level or maybe maybe we have a conversation about, you know, working with the city manager to work with these other agencies, Cal Water, Golden State Water, to ensure that we're taking this seriously and making it easier for our residents to do this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that that would be my suggestion. I don't either respond to this point, but we're going to we're you know, that's something I'm interested in pursuing next. In terms of the health department, I want to begin by thanking them for the work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They mentioned very clearly, Kelly mentioned very clearly that it's a science and an art to manage a department that's, you know, upwards 90% grant funds. Our office, the ninth district office, has worked with them very closely in the in recent years, and I've seen their commitment to our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was hoping you can provide an update on a couple of things. First, you mentioned very quickly a proposed healthy Long Beach plan that might be coming. That sounds really interesting. Could you just shed some light on that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As we started to look at all the different activities that we do across the city, across our departments, as well as a lot of the place based efforts, we all are working in a way that that applies to a healthy Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so what we've been doing is meeting as a team of department directors. And so pretty much everybody you have heard from so far in terms of the public safety, the library, code enforcement, neighborhood services, as well as public works and workforce investment, all of us together are sitting down to say, okay, how do we, as a'",
        "'speaker_13': 'coordinated effort, move forward the health of this city? Because it takes all of us. There have been many plans that have been done so far within the city, including the Community Health Improvement Plan, the safe Long Beach violence prevention plan, mobility element.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The land use element is underway. The housing element. We are working on a healthy living policy and there are active living principles. All of these things are already in place as well as a lot of strategic planning for many of our partners.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so we're coordinating all of that into one document and then starting to move that forward for the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I think that's really important to do. And along that same vein. Would you mind chiming in with a quick update on the Kaiser Permanente Heal Zone program in North Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sure. So he goes on really is an example of how it takes all of us to move things forward. So we've been working with Public Works Department to make street improvements as a result of the walk out at findings at Grant Elementary, Starkey Elementary and Hamilton Middle School.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We've been working very closely with the Parks Department around implementing a fitness zone at Coolidge Park, and we're putting in a new one also at Hilton Park. And we are in partnership with Long Beach Community Action Partnership. We have a grant elementary farmstand that's open after school every Tuesday when it's in session.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we're partnering with the Jordan High School AIMS program and working to identify and implement a project there to improve nutrition and fitness at the school, as well as working with the children's clinic to create sort of a voucher system where they can they can write a prescription and have a voucher redeemable at one of the local'",
        "'speaker_13': 'and at the farm stands at our healthy corner store, the farmer's market.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. And then finally, so I'm really interested in this chronic homeless initiative coordinator position. I remember just months ago, we pulled together a number of the agencies that that have homelessness issues in North Long Beach with their police by different agencies, Caltrans, L.A. County, flood control along the river, Southern California Edison right away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and we we came together as all four agencies and talked about a strategy to to address these encampments from a holistic standpoint. Is this something that this position would take on and really build on?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This position will be really coordinating different efforts such as that, as well as some of the other chronic chronic homeless initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Great. Thank you. And then the public works. I'll be quick. A number. The questions I had were were a number of the questions I had Councilmember Mungo brought up. So I won't chime in there, but I will I will say that I am interested in seeing the valuation, the numbers that come back from this study as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to how much it would cost to actually keep up with, you know, with the level of of the level our streets are or to improve on that. So I'm really interested in that. That's it. Thank you. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Concern Boston.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I'll be shorter than Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that won't be tough to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know my colleagues in the audience would appreciate that. First of all, I'd like to just thank all three department heads for being here today, and thank you for the excellent work that you and your department put forth on behalf of the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Each one of you have contributed in your departments, have contributed to making Long Beach a leader leading city in the state of California, particularly in the areas of health. I think we have the best public works department in the state and our water department is leading the way in conservation efforts as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Noted. Now, my question is for Mr. Malloy, and right away something jumps out at me on the the financial summary and the budget, particularly in the 515 expenditures. It's markedly different than 514 in the areas of material, supplies and services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a significant reduction, I want to say close to $39 million. Can you explain that?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm trying to find that. Is that part of our presentation or you're talking about the budget document.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The document?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yes. Welcome. Can I have my document?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know what he was asking?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so under the proposed you got it.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You're looking at adjusted f y 14 and propose that y 15. Correct the difference of 2 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, about 39 million.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Oh, okay. So these are basically the one time funds that were allocated to public works to be able to perform all those projects. So it is just basically the one time funds that fluctuated from a 514.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. But it's it's under the line under the materials, supplies and services. So would it would it be largely weighted on services? Now he's talking about materials. I really. I thought this would be quick.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So it takes a village to raise me, right? This. This is basically the difference between private services or services that we we have for all those special projects.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So you have a significant or would you say you have enough in the budget to to carry out the services at the level we expect? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So this year's budget, basically, it was flat for us. It's it's possible that what you're seeing and if y 15 is the movement of one of the bureaus into the city manager's office, therefore there will be a reduction in our budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. Maybe we can get some further clarification on that at another later date. I'd like to also, while I have the director of the water department here, think your department is doing a great job. You know, we hate to see rate increases, but they were pretty much imposed upon us by the Metropolitan Water District.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is that correct? That's right. Can you explain the metropolitan water districts where rate increases and and and their reserve fund?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll leave that up to our med director to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And even I can't explain it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so I understand that they have a pretty robust reserve, yet they rate raising rates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. And I want everyone to know that Mr. Guardia has done a tremendous job to point out the financial irresponsibility of that. But to no avail.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I just thought it was important for the public to understand that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I wouldn't pass up this opportunity to give you some information. Please. So. So today at their board meeting, despite the fact that they revealed that instead of the $352 million in surplus reserves, surplus reserves that they last reported that they had, it was reported today that that was actually 400 between 400 million and 425 million.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So another 50 to 75 million that materialized in the last two months of their last fiscal year. So despite that, they continue to raise their water rates and they kept their property tax at the same level as last year when they.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only reason they're supposed to be allowed to do that is if for purposes of financial necessity, they can't reduce their their parcel tax. So they made a decision today, which director Lowenthal did not vote for, which said that for purposes of financial necessity, they need to keep their property tax at the same level as last year'",
        "'speaker_4': 'instead of reduce it as they would otherwise otherwise be required to do by law. So I can't explain it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, thank you for the briefing. And I'm sure now that our that we're aware, our residents will pay a lot closer attention to what's going on in other public agencies that impact us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. Much shorter. We think just getting counts and branches.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. And for all you individuals who don't know the budget in all nine districts, we will have a budget summit. So this is our quick. This should be. I just want to talk to the health department and the public works.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One question. The population by seniors is growing in Long Beach in our current program and services in the health department. I just want to know if they're keeping up with the increase, you know, especially for our seniors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's for the health department.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's all I need.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We we we are planning, though, it is a key strategic goal for us to increase those services. And we're working closely with Parks and Rec, who also have the senior centers, but that is a key focus areas of ours moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Currently, we do not have the funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I say that being a senior citizen. Thank you very much. The other would be public works. And I would like to know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does we you know, how do we support our school and their recycling efforts?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could anyone tell me that in public works?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Councilman Andrews, thank you for that question. This one I can answer gratefully. We this we required a city contractor, which is Waste Management, to provide recycling collection at all Long Beach schools. And we support the green for the green teams at different Long Beach schools and we provide technical assistance to the school.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we are definitely involved and we provide those services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not queued up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was on the Red Canterbury ring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uncomfy. Okay. But nobody ever addressed it wrong again. But actually, Councilmember Andrews, I was going to ask the same question about senior services, because it's not here in your in your for future applications. Some programs I would love to see some programing in their next next budget round or even shorter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, that's you know, for me, I just became a senior citizen. So there's a point for me as I reach another era in my life in regards to and this might be a totally different, different topic that we might be getting into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I wanted to ask about the the housing, the affordable housing that's out there for 21,000 residents. So a thousand units I know that we've been talking about the housing element and the 20% set aside for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Does that come into play with this at all or is there is there a nexus to this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The these units, they're they're the housing authority vouchers. So they are funding directly from the from HUD that that that we support people and working with different landlords to house them. It is not part of this piece of it is not part of the the building of additional housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Okay. That's a city manager question and you know, where are we going with that, with that, with that project, with with our housing authority, with the 20% set aside for affordable housing in the in the overall housing element?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Earlier earlier and there was a report given in the Budget Oversight Committee where as Barack gave a presentation on the 20% housing set aside dollars that are coming back to the agency, that are getting repaid, back to the FSA, to the city, excuse me, in the form of affordable dollars and going to our housing trust fund'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So that was a pretty thorough report. It's available in the Budget Oversight Committee and we could certainly give you that. Okay. Yeah, I missed that meeting, so I was wondering about that. Also, in regards to the Health Department, the yeah, $1 million in general fund, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, that really says a lot about the health department and all the money it brings in. I think I've said it before in regards to the wonderful staff you have and being able to go after grants and bring them to the city and but what does that 1 million go to using in general or general types'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of services? I know some of it goes to homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And those resources are primarily for homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A good portion of it in. Okay. And I had one more than know when you're looking at identify sustained funding for the health department. What things are you looking at as examples.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Looking at some different federal grants? There are a number of large federal grants out there right now looking at health promotion and other prevention strategies. So we have applied for a couple of purple. Of those are waiting to hear back.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There are multimillion dollar grants we are working at, looking at different partnerships with our local health care systems and with other with other partners to start to build and more consistent grant funding that's not related to a specific project, a short term project, but something that is more sustainable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There might be an opportunity there for some senior services.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That is one of those key areas we're looking at. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Wonderful. Thank you. That's it. Or by the way, I am not that I don't like water and public works. I love you guys. But I met with him earlier this week, too. I think I got a good orientation at that point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And finally, Councilman O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I'll try to make this as efficient as possible with regard to public works. Thank you for all you do. You did a great job an of park started expanding that park about eight years ago and I just finished it off with a nice community center we opened a couple of weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Beautiful building, much loved by the community. So thank you. You did a lot of work this year on Stearns. We've got more to do now. WHALEY The same thing, more to do now. And we've got plans for the Nature Center done a little bit out there, but we'll do more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you for your help on that. That's my point. You guys do wonderful work. All right? You're really on top of it. So thank you. Question about parking meters. As I recall, we were going to put 800,001 time money into parking meters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's you right that your department, is that accurate?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. This is being worked with the city manager's office. I believe you had a two from four that explained where we going. There was an initial request from Belmont Shore Associates that they wanted to go to a more advanced technology as far as parking meters that utilize.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'ID cards. So we have done extensive studies. We have looked at financials, and our next task is to talk to the stakeholders. And when everybody is on board and understand what the issues are, we'll come back to city council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess I don't necessarily have a problem on the credit card. I've used those before, but the doubling of the rates, as I understand it, seems a little excessive to me even though they are competitive now. I think that's a bit of a jump and we're putting $800,000, I guess would be one time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'General fund money to Belmont Shore keeps part of the funding. Correct. So would they carry part of the burden?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Belmont will fund their SIPP portion. The 800,000 is for the rest of the city, which includes downtown and other areas that have parking meters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And downtown doesn't keep a portion of their money.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Downtown keeps 50% of the parking, creates the rest, goes to the LBA.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they'll they too will carry some of the burden of the cost of the correct that that should happen shouldn't be all on the general fund if they're going to share some of the I mean they all they may have revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Balances now that would cover those expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So again, they should participate in that. With regard to street sweeping, I hope we're working on finding some efficiencies there. I mean, around here, we've had the two extremes. And from my point of view, you know what, we're good at contracting out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're good at cutting, but we're not good at finding efficiencies in innovation. And that's something we need to work on as a city. So I hope as we look at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The street sweeping bureau.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'RVO label it, that we can look at finding efficiencies and innovation over there that will save costs and enhance service levels. We've talked about the two hour window, etc., so I hope that that can be done and I hope that's ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, Robin, you propose, hey, not contracting out. You know, Pat was on the path of contracting the amount that the council last council, not all of them, but put them on. And I get that. I mean, that's management, that's leadership.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we need both here and both means finding efficiencies in innovation. So I hope we can do that. I hope we can really look at that. I mean, a couple of years ago, we were going to contract out time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We never did. But did we ever find efficiencies in innovation there? I don't know. So again, let's think like that. We need to do more thinking like that. With regard to water, thank you. And are you going to meet with Parks and Rec tomorrow?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As I understand it, I made some comments a couple of weeks ago that sparked some interest over on your site. I know I had a conversation with your president there. Great conversation. And hopefully we can find ways to work together on the on the water front, especially with regard to Parks and Rec, because it's so expensive for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'them to maintain their their fields, etc., that, you know, our kids are on every weekend. And this isn't just about water, this isn't just about grass. It's also about what we want as a community for our kids. So that's a big deal to me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with regard to your fund balances you have down here, I noticed the water fund and there's probably one on the sewer fund too. You talk about your ending fund balance. I'm assuming beyond your ending fund balance, you have reserves for your CFP projects too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with these be separate from your CFP project, set it set aside dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, there's no there's no additional. So there is no it is. Okay. So I guess so it's that thing. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, great. And one other question for our I'm going to punch back to you on page ten of the community handbook. It talks about some one time expenditures and fleet. And I thought the way we funded fleet operations typically and you could correct me was that we bill interdepartmental so that when let's say you know the police'",
        "'speaker_6': 'department has as a vehicle public works bills them I don't know maybe on a monthly basis $600 per vehicle. I don't know what it would be. And that would cover, you know, the maintenance and the cost of the vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my question would be, what are those one time expenditures? I believe they're $8. If off the top of my head, if I'm correct, 4 million I'm sorry, 4 million. It's a jump. And it says one time there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what piqued my curiosity. Council member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The fleet operation is under finance so I'll.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The that you are exactly right as the funding this is the expenditures related to collections from the departments to buy replacement vehicles for them in FY 14. The amounts of purchases were kept low below the amount that was collected in FY 15.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are proposing that fleet replacements start to catch up with our aging vehicles and have a more normal fleet replacement schedule. So that increase of four is just to get us to our normal replacement level with money collected from the departments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So if it's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Money collected from the departments, why? Why? Or is that figure that we're seeing on that chart from the departments?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, it is revenue. So it's from the different departments. And then what you're seeing is the expenditure of that, an increase of four.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Got it. With that, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilman Price, would you come back up?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry. Mr. GROSS right on that same point. Is it possible for us to get a list of. What specific priorities you and or department heads contemplate in regards to the Fleet Fund?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are. We are. And Councilmember O'Donnell talked about innovation and the whole area of how we replace vehicles and fund vehicles we are looking at from top to bottom. So at present, that is a a holding point for what we know will be a required replacement list.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we are engaging a consultant to help us look at and review which vehicles should be replaced to do it in the most cost effective manner so that we are not replacing vehicles where it is more cost effective to keep them in service a bit longer, and that we are replacing those specific vehicles that are costing us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more money than it's worth keeping. So we are in the process of reviewing that and we can certainly that probably will take several months and we will not be spending that money, but we know that based on our study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that management partners suggested that that $11 million, which is the total amount for FY 15, is an amount that we will need to spend. We just don't know exactly what vehicles they will be yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, then, is it fair to say that we also aren't ready to spend the money until that study is complete, and that that probably won't be for another 4 to 6 months?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It will be shorter than that. And we and so that money will be needed fairly early on in the FY15 cycle because we have to meet when the cars are available, the new models are available, we have to order at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we'll be ready for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Just I just have one comment. Mr. West, also through as far as the health department. I'm really happy to see another one making a lot of changes to adjust to the changes in the Affordable Health Care Act and all the new the new reality of where we are with health care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make sure that that one we're reinforcing with all of our part time employees at the city what their options are when it comes to the Affordable Care Act. And I just mentioned it because I casually was talking to one of our part time employees who was mostly a Spanish speaking employee who didn't feel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'like she had the information about what her options were. And so I think the more that we can do to provide all of our our workforce, that particularly the part timers that may not be met may not be getting the medical benefits through the city, as much information about their health options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be that would be great. And then second to that, I think that we can do as a city hopefully a lot more moving forward as we partner and promote the Affordable Health Care Act. I think it's in our best interest to get as many Long Beach residents signed up as possible for the long term health'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the entire city. And so if there's ways moving forward that the council and the city can partner to and really begin a larger campaign that's already happening through that through obviously to the federal government and that we can get our our residents signed up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I still find large amounts of people in our city that don't have all the information, particularly those that don't speak English. And so I think we need to do a better job of that, particularly in in different languages.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Mayor We've worked very closely with our community partners to holding events throughout the throughout the different times. And we are certainly willing to reach out to our, you know, to our employees and and broader community as we do that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we are part of a large a large consortium of people, and we'll continue that process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the work you've done so far has been great. And so I don't take it as a criticism because I think I see the Health Department out there all the time. I see the table and the community worked with the nonprofits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just I think there's opportunities for us to go beyond that. And hopefully we can we can work together on that. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. So with that, going to turn this over and open it up for public comment on the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Gregory Moore. I am here to speak in favor of one of Mayor Garcia's budget recommendations, and that is a one time $50,000 in matching funds for a marketing plan for the Arts Council for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. I have a pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lay of the land in Long Beach artistically. I have covered it a lot as a journalist. I'm also a musician and a writer. Long Beach has a tremendously vibrant art scene. It's definitely one of our cultural strengths, but I think, as we all know, Long Beach has never really done a good job establishing itself as a destination'",
        "'speaker_6': 'location for outlying areas. It's something that we all want to see, and culturally it's one of the things that we can attract. We we have this great scene going. So a marketing sort of a marketing plan developed, good marketing for this would be really helpful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the things I understand that would be would be used, I understand from the new executive director of Victoria Brian.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is would be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For a comprehensive arts calendar something we don't have no publication in Long Beach provides a good arts calendar, something we desperately need not only for outlying areas to be aware of what's going on, but for people within Long Beach, which is a pretty big city, to be aware of what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With their own community. So I haven't got a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good chance to know this, Brian, yet. I do know Mark Austin, Michael Sugarman, the president of the Arts Council, the city of Long Beach, couldn't have a more a better presence and a better advocate for the arts than Marco.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Arts Council recently released.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Strategic plan where they did some self analysis. And one of the things that they themselves noted in the past is that they haven't done a great job marketing. That kind of self-awareness, I think, really bodes well for this money being spent to some new strategies to really put Long Beach more on the cultural map.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Bear. Members of the council. My name is for de Castro and I'm a resident of the third district. My address is 616 Grand Avenue. And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of our housing advocates. And I had the pleasure of being at the Budget Oversight Committee that Vice Mayor Susilo Atwal facilitated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think tonight as well and last week, just seeing the complexity of the decisions you have in front of you, I'm really I have to say, I'm really impressed with the amount of homework each of you has done and the work that you're doing to really ask critical questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So really appreciate that. I'm here tonight to urge you to engage us, the community, stakeholders, on the critical issue of housing that is affordable to Long Beach working families. As we heard tonight from Director Kelly Collopy that the city has provided safe and affordable housing to approximately 21,000 residents in 7000 units through housing authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we still, as she admitted, there's still a huge gap with regards to housing production. And as all of you know, the Council of Governments instructed the city that we need 4009 new units by, I believe, 2021. So we're still in a housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I realize.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a really, really long road we're on, but we have to begin that journey with one step. So I encourage you to to engage us on this issue. It's been a discouraging, to be honest, that we've been at every budget oversight committee meeting, council budget hearings, sharing testimony, written materials regarding dedicating the boomerang funds for affordable'",
        "'speaker_2': 'housing. Yet there has been no council dialog or response to our presence. It's also very significant to have this level of community involvement, as you can imagine, this complex time to have residents provide their testimony, either, you know, their personal stories on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's been a lot of community engagement on it. I also want to share I facilitated back in 2005 actually for the department Health and Human Services, the ten year plan to end homelessness. And there were five key elements that we identified back then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the first is, and I'll just mention it right here, the first finding was how the housing goal was increase the number of homes that homeless and low income people can afford. So I think Director.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Colby is doing a great job of helping to meet that need. But we again, we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Need new housing production and let's let's begin that journey and let's work critically together. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Carrie Gallagher. I'm the executive director of housing Long Beach, and my information is on file. You know, last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Week, 100 people came out to the city council meeting and stayed very late to show their.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Support for the use of boomerang funds for housing. 35 people were there at the Budget Oversight Committee tonight, and even 20 people have stayed linked to the night as well tonight to show their support. And we're here especially tonight to address housing as an issue of health and as an issue of infrastructure health.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a pretty simple connection, right? I mean, the health department does an excellent job at addressing homelessness, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not prevent homelessness until we actually make sure that people have affordable homes in which to live.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as it relates to infrastructure, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't get homeless people off the streets by building more streets. We get homeless people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Off the streets by building more homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I want to make it very clear, since so many people have asked, well, if we, you know, put the boomerang funds towards housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or a percentage of the funds, where will the money come from? And so we are proposing tonight that infrastructure is the first place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where the money should be realigned and rebalanced to represent the full.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Extent of community infrastructure with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing as one of those basic building blocks of community infrastructure. So for those of you who are not at the Budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oversight Committee tonight, like Mr. Ranga, thank you for your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Question. I will give you a quick recap.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We were very grateful to see the agenda item or to see boomerang funds. Finally, agendas. But unfortunately, because of time constraints, the many speakers were only given one minute to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speak and council made absolutely no comments before receiving and filing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we recognize again, we were on time constraints, but we are here again and we will keep coming to urge you to take this behind the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rail and please have a meaningful discussion about housing and the boomerang funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to spend the rest of my time reacting to the staff report that was given to the Budget Oversight Committee and CC Blanc, a carbon copy to the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Around the Boomerang funds. This report paints an.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Inaccurate and misleading.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Picture of housing resources available for housing creation in Long Beach, and it diverts the conversation from addressing the topic at hand. Now the eight page report made an extensive list of different resources available in regards to housing, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unfortunately it does not actually.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Address the question of creating a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Permanent new local revenue source. Many of the funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That were identified, over 9.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Million were home and call home dollars, which do not create new.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Housing at all. These are rehabilitation and homebuyer assistance programs. Other monies that were identified were debt obligations that are legally required to be spent, such as the 24.7 million from the mayor's proposals, and the rest are state and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Federal dollars available only to developers, not to the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City. And though these are resources, this is not addressing the actual need for funds. Lastly, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Report was discouraging because it seemed to assess that we're doing more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Than enough for housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we cannot have a meaningful discussion with you around housing until we actually admit that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is a housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we hope that we will move forward. This discussion tonight that you will address the issue of boomerang funds behind the rail, and we urge you to support the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Commitment of these funds for housing. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, counsel. My name is Ben Fisher. I'm a resident of the First District. I'm here to let you know. I personally attended multiple community meetings on the housing element, multiple planning, commission meetings, council meetings, budget meetings, budget committee meetings, and frankly, my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yet nothing has been done around funding new housing stock. Nor do I feel the community input process around housing has been sincere or impactful. This is set to be the fourth year without any new city funding for housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please do not be fooled by the recent report touting state bills or some of the other things I've seen touting things coming from housing, rental assistance from the federal government. This is said to be the fourth consecutive year, despite needing to produce 4000 new affordable units by 2021.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been asking that 20% of the funds returned to the city go to housing, and many of you in your actual campaigns have said that housing is a priority issue and even specifically mentioned that 20% of boomerang funds should go to housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The funds would not create a deficit, but it would redirect existing funds. So I have a question for all of you. Do you feel you have the power to shape a budget someone else created, which is pending your approval?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If your answer is no, then what is a function of your approval? What is your role in this process? Assuming there is no political will to move the funds around. And if you guys want to have a meaningful dialog about where those funds would come from, we would love to have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I ask that you please make sure that during your tenure you do not allow a fifth year to go by without any new city funds for housing. If you feel that you do have the power to shape a budget someone else created, then please take time to evaluate where housing is in the infrastructure, safety and health priorities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of your constituents. I particularly emphasize this for those of you who spoke of housing as a priority during your campaigns. If housing is a priority to you and those elected to you, it should be prioritized in any budget that you approve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Someone once asked me after the seat took on none of the community and housing element. Why is it so hard? I answered, Because it's the most important element, the biggest part of people's budgets. So if it's the biggest boat to turn around, it'd be easier to just let it be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't be a council that lets the big important choices continue floating on into the sunset. Roll up your sleeves and turn it toward your constituents voices. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor and council members. My name is Gloria Rivera, resident of the second District and a community organizer with Housing in Long Beach. We are here before you yet again today to talk about boomerang funds because it was advised by the city council during the housing element last year that we bring it to the budget'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and talk about it within the context of the budget. We came today during the Budget Oversight Committee hearing, and as you heard before, not only was our time cut down to one minute, but there was absolutely no discussion behind the rail about this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what good is coming to the budget hearings if there's not going to be a healthy, vibrant, robust discussion about this housing crisis and its need? Recently, we have heard from you, Mr. Mayor, that the next big issue city leadership is going to be tackling is affordable homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But before we talk about building new homes, we have to talk about where the local, permanent local source of funding is going to be coming from. The community continues to present themselves in support of remedying this housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just think about what this would mean to the community and to the members, which you all serve. It would allow us to to as a city, to leverage other resources everywhere to help foster safer and healthier community and neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More importantly, it would demonstrate your commitment to the well-being of your community and your city. It will set a higher standard of leadership for the region, and it will establish trust through your support of the community's needs. On the other hand, imagine what happens if we don't allow boomerang funds or locate any kind of local source of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'funding. Are you willing to be the one to say to a homeless vets, Sorry, you can't find an affordable place to live or to a single mother? Sorry, you have to decide between paying rent or your medical child's expenses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know. Sorry. I understand that this is a hard decision to make. I understand that this is politically challenging. I understand that these funds have supposedly been allocated within the budget. But when you do what I do and you hear these stories day in and day out, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not that hard of a decision because you see firsthand how this will affect thousands of lives in Long Beach. We recognize the resources that the staff has discussed in the memo, but they are not new. They are not local and they are not permanent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if not boomerang funds, then what funding are we allocating? And if not in this budget, then when we have heard over and over again that now is not the time, how far down the road are you willing to kick this can?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is an issue of health, of public safety and an overall benefit to the community. So if the question is where do we pull the funds as it has been, then pull it from infrastructure because it's a benefit to the overall community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The time is now to show your leadership and to show your commitment of service to the people of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Just to make sure I'm unless there's another speaker who's going to line up, I'm cutting off the speaker's list. If you haven't, unless you want that, please line up, sir. Okay. So that gentleman will be the last person on the speaker's list, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Honorable Mayor Councilmembers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Dave Sterling.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With the IAM and as many of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You already have expressed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tonight, I'd like to express our support on behalf of the roughly 3500 employees within the city that we represent for the mayor's budget recommendation of stopping the pursuit of outsourcing, street sweeping, but rather searching in word inside the operation to find efficiencies and cost savings or at the same time maintaining the high standard of service that exists'",
        "'speaker_2': 'currently. The idea of city management partnering with our members, the city employees who perform the work. On a day to day basis makes sense, and it should serve as a model for other operations as well rather than than outsourcing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look at ways to make current operations better, more cost effective. The employees who perform these services, many of them live here in the city, and they.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Take ownership and pride in the work they.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do. And that's something you won't find by excising an operation and outsourcing it. And if the charge truly was to find cost savings and efficiencies, it's my hope. Management partners would have found this solution long ago, as we already could have been saving the amount of money that we hope it will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. Good evening. My name? Gigi Fusco. Ms.. I am a proud member of the Arts Council for Long Beach Board of Directors, and I'm here to speak about the one time allocation that's in the budget proposed for for our organization.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a great group, the Arts Council of Long Beach. We are very committed to the arts, the artists and all the art performing arts, visual art groups here in our amazing community. They bring they bring up the raise the quality of life for all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They feed our souls, and they're also big employers in town as well. If approved for this money, it will help in our strategic plan and mission to make Long Beach a number one artistic destination, arts destination in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's real easy to do. We are so lucky. I love Long Beach. You don't have to leave the city limits to find anything you want. We have the Long Beach. We have a symphony, opera, ballet, the Long Beach Playhouse, Musical Theater West, the Found Art Exchange, the Expo Building.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have so many wonderful organizations which time will not allow me to list them all here tonight. So don't get mad at me, guys. We have so many wonderful things. What a lucky group of elected officials you are that you have these treasures in your town, in your own districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We went out and talked to them and we found that they really need our support. They have weathered the financial downturn. They are still here. A lot of organizations, museums, performing arts groups, they have not weathered the storm as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they need our support. We need to see them thrive and grow. We need to see them bringing in new people into town and also providing all the wonderful educational programs that they have. We need to let people know that they exist and they need to be supported.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know this firsthand. I ran the Long Beach Playhouse for many years and worked with musical Theater West and it's really great to see the faces of people who come to Long Beach for the first time to see an exhibit or a show.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is not just something that's fun and to to feed our soul, but it drives the economic engine of our community. When you go out for dinner, for a show and dinner or to go see an exhibit, you're employing a babysitter or a parking attendant, you know, waitstaff, restaurateurs and maybe a bartender or two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said, this money will help us really shine a light on the arts in this amazing community, drive tourism and let our residents know about all the wonderful assets that they have. They don't have to leave the city limit at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach is the best place for arts. We need everybody now. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, hello. I'm Joe Weinstein. Eighth District of the Community Budget Book encourages citizens to come out and say, what are the services that matter to them? And so that encourages the kind of special pleading you have heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we'll hear more of I'm not here for that. I'm not here to endorse or oppose a specific recommendation for this budget. I would like to point out that those of us who would like to take a broad picture rather than advocate for one program and expand one program, and if the money somehow won't have to come'",
        "'speaker_9': 'from somewhere else, I'm here to advocate for those of us who are ready to make trade offs. If only we had the information to suggest those tradeoffs four years ago and more. The budget, as posted in its papers, provided a certain basic amount of information to allow you to cast out specific services and therefore compare their costs'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and therefore decide maybe you would like more of this and less of that. The one signal example that I have seen tonight and I commend I commend that example is the Water Department's presentation, which showed us the difference in costs between MWD and WMD or WMD.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At any rate, that enables you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To make a comparison, enables you to make policies that don't call for increasing funds, but says, Gee, we ought to shift things a little bit if we only can. Well, we don't have such guidance in the budget ever since four years ago, even recommendations that I made based on cost comparisons and another occasion of ordinary trash collection'",
        "'speaker_9': 'versus straight sweeping, they were based on cost that I could assemble only from the budget of four years ago and more. Because you have given because the budget's given the citizens no real tools to suggest rational alternatives, and they apparently give yourselves behind the rail.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No more such tools either. I find it very difficult to participate any further in this kind of so-called budget process. So I suggest that if you really are serious about crafting a budget, give yourself more time between the first public unveiling and the time you've got to pass a budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And second of all, make sure that that budget document once again breaks out unit costs for specific services. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Joe. Joe, you will be happy next year where we're looking at some new budget software and the end also is restructuring the process a bit to make it much more open and interactive. And there's some great stuff happening out there with some open government budget software and some of the process, participatory government stuff that's happening'",
        "'speaker_3': ', budget stuff that's happening in some of the districts. And that's all going to come together next year in a new way. So I think you'll you'll be back here, I hope, saying that you look forward to it.'",

And first of all, I want to thank the mayor and the council members, because I have no idea how with a part time job, you are able to take care of this budget oversight and take care of your districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much for everything that you guys do. I really, really appreciate it. I came here basically to thank the mayor for his recommendation to put in a preservation planner into the budget. I understand that it's not supposed to cost any more money, but I want to emphasize how important it is to our districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have 17 historic districts. It is not just about paint, color or fence heights. Historic districts are wonderful because they speak to the character of our city, the craftsmanship of the people who lived here. It is a sustainable solution.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Jim Darrow. I'm also with Willmar City Heritage. How do I follow that? That's exactly what I'm here to say. Thank you for suggesting the preservation planner. It helps with the integrity of the or the historical historical integrity of our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really quick, also, I want to thank public works. I wish all departments in the city were run as well as you guys. You guys have always been there for every call we've had regarding everything from new parks, helping us with planners and such as well as street sweeping.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Those meetings were full. Everyone was a participant and everyone had a buy in to the Arts Council. What we were trying to do. I'm not an artist. I'm not a photographer, a singer, a writer, a director, a Delson, an actor, a professor of art.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do none of those things. Nonetheless, our board has that level of diversity where we have arts professionals alongside accountants, college professors, lawyers and marketing professionals, each with a full buy into the new strategic plan. So I urge you to adopt the recommendation for funding to implement that strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I was interviewed as an Arts Council board member for the Strategic Plan, I reiterated why I have served three three year terms as an Arts Council Board of Directors member. I expressed to the Strategic Planning Committee that it continues to be a priority for the Arts Council, that we increase our engagement, our presence at arts events'",

        "'speaker_0': 'didn't know there was anything further east in Pali and to the true east of Long Beach over by Eldorado Park. It turns out that other Arts Council board of directors, members and stakeholders had the same ideas about what they desired for the Arts Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we become engaged in all nine Council districts and we make everyone aware of the events that are going on within walking distance of their homes. We recently partnered with and co-sponsored a joint skateboarding BMX art event where we featured skateboarding and BMX artists.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a second event where we set up a mobile gallery at the Long Beach Formula Drift Racing event and featured Long Beach, Long Beach artists. We also partnered with Stuart Ashman at Miller, Chris Stokes at the University Art Museum and Michele Roberts at the Carpenter Center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they would show each of these artists works and would also give free entry to their families so their families could come and see what they were doing. The implementation of the Arts Council Strategic Plan will bring us right back to where we were, where we're asking you to partner with us, assign a staff member to come'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So budgets are everywhere. The reason why I felt compelled to speak to this budget matter and to all of these issues, I'm deciding whether or not to stay in Long Beach for my own personal housing. If that issue didn't come up tonight, I wouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It came up a lot. So I came to throw my personal voice instead of everyone else with budgets and studies and paperwork's in there pledging everything.

I'm going to turn over to our Melvoin, who's the construction manager for this, with Public Works, and he's also supported by our library director, Glenda Williams.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Honorable Mayor and council members, are you interested to see the perspectives for this project? I have five boards here. I can show it on an easel or a PowerPoint. Depends on your appetite. I know it's late. I waited.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I want to begin by acknowledging the residents. It's no surprise that they waited all night to attend this. We've been waiting a decade for this library was one night, right. So I just want to say that I'm really honored and proud to be in the position to finally award this contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's been generations of council people, generations of North Pack and community leaders who have invested in this and really had a vision. Now we're in a position to really build the crown jewel to the uptown renaissance. That's what we're doing tonight.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Now we've got over 90,000 residents that we service, and this library we're building is 25,000 square feet. So we're building the library of today in the Library of tomorrow.

        "'speaker_6': 'the ability to move forward with the redevelopment. So I'm really excited about that. And with that, ala, I, you know, I've already made the motion, so I encourage my colleagues to support this this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And I am equally proud to be here today to hopefully vote on this library, award this contract, and move this of this process forward. It has been a long time coming. I see many of our residents from North Long Beach here who have worked on this project longer than I have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Quite frankly, and I want to acknowledge them as well. And their hard work efforts through the former redevelopment agency Neighborhood Associations, CAG, North Long Beach Community Action Group. They're there. Their hard work and efforts is actually coming to fruition tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is as a Councilmember Richardson said, this will be a this will be transformational for for North Long Beach, for the Atlantic corridor, not only for the North Village, mixed use development that is planned for that area, but for the North Village that exist there where my current council field office is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there are a number of opportunities for economic development, and we think this will be the catalyst for major change in North Long Beach. I'm so proud to be here tonight and I will be supporting this without reservation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. And we're going to open it up to public comment. But, Mr. West, if the if the bid is awarded tonight, when do when will the community actually see construction?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We hope by the 1st of October.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. You heard that 1st of October. Please come forward for a comment. Make sure you identify yourself for the record.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. My name is Steve Cuneo. I am the general counsel for AMG and Associates, who was one of the other bidders on this project. And sitting in the audience, I can see that everyone is excited about this project moving forward and I'm sure that it will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, I think it's very important that the Council understand that there is a big protest here and that there have been irregularities in the awarding of this contract, making it contrary to California's public contracting law that I think need to be considered by this council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'According to staff. AMG was the second low bidder on this contract. However, we are convinced that there is a fundamental flaw, especially as filled out by the low bidder wood cliff with the bid form that the cities used.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe you have copies of not only our bid protests, which were not mentioned in staff's report, but also those those bid forms. Now, California's public bidding laws have two primary purposes. The first is to make sure that all qualified bidders have a fair opportunity to bid on public projects throughout California.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The second is to prevent what's called bid shopping by prying bidders. Bid shopping occurs when a prime bidder takes a listed subcontractors bid, sends it out to other subcontractors in an attempt to undercut that bid, get lower prices submitted, and pad their profit on a project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's one of the primary evils, and that's what the legislature has called it an evil that the public contracting code seeks to prevent. Now, in this case, if you take a look at the bid form, it's got two places, four numbers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's got.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A 21.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Item listing broken down by trades, concrete, electrical, those types of things. And then those numbers are supposed to have a total, total bid item on the second page. Those two numbers are supposed to match. And in Amg's bid, they did match, but they did not match in the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Apparent Loews bid in Wood Cliff's bid. And there's a difference of about $800,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With the numbers in the individual columns being lower. Okay. Why does that matter, you ask? The answer is public contract code 5103. Public contract 50. Public contract code 5103. Gives five working days for a bidder to withdraw a bid for a mathematical mistake.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what this allows, what the form has allowed the low bidder to do, theoretically, is to take those five days, go back to its subcontractors, tell them, hey, we're not sure we can do the bid for this price, but if you can bring your price down a little bit lower, hey, I think maybe we can do it'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But if we can't, we may just have to claim that there's a mistake on the bid. Pull it off the table and sorry, nobody gets any work. Now, whether or not that was done in this case, we do not know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the fact is, it is legally irrelevant. Case law in California is very clear that if there is an opportunity, if there's a situation that allows a bidder to pull its bid off the table for a mathematical error, as in this case, city cannot waive it as an immaterial deviation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's just it's just straight up California law that that cannot be waived. It's not discretionary. It's not in your option. So, you know, we just want to make it clear here that AMG, we feel, has submitted the lowest bid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It follow the rules. It didn't build a bid mistake.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir. Time's up. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lori Angell. I was North PAC chair and I was on the PAC since 1996. We worked on this project for ten years, and you folks have absolutely no idea what it took to get us here. And the fact that we have a contractor protesting the bid just kind of falls into the whole thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't care what it takes. I want I want to get a contract moving. You have no idea what I'm I'm going to be redundant. But anyway, this is a great project. It's an important project. I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The value of a library and what it offers to the community cannot be understated. Every dollar of investment in a library is an investment into literacy and community, and it's a reduction in the cost and public safety. It really is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the more people that we can get trained and able to read and able to take care of themselves in the world, the less money you have to spend on graffiti. Quality of life issues, incarceration. The justice system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And people on welfare. And that's already been stated by Glenda. So I'm hoping that you will invest in this important project and finally have this dream that we've worked on for over ten years, come to reality, to serve the community, to act as a center and an activation point for a very important part of our our part'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of town. And to, you know, frankly, give us something too extreme to be extremely proud of. So it's an opportunity. The problem with the bid, it's I think our legal folks took a look at this. And if they didn't see a problem, I don't I don't know what happens now, but truthfully, I just want this thing to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'move. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Marina Parker. I'm the program manager for the Uptown Property Community Association. I manage the new Business Improvement District, the new North Library. North Long Beach Library is going to be located right in the heart of the Business Improvement District.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this site is a very important site for us in terms of there's a lot of under undeveloped lots in that area and that's going to be one of the first ones. It's going to be redevelopment. And we're along with the Business Improvement District.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're very excited to to continue this uptown renaissance in that area. And we are extremely looking forward to the library and the construction of the library. And this is going to all be part of this revolution that we have in the north uptown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are extremely looking forward to your support and we're very excited about all of the changes happening in the north Long Beach area. So we want to thank you for your support on this.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And she was in and out of this. This is a great moment for North Long Beach. I'm sure that we'll have a discussion about what's the adverse effects of any legalities. But this is it's time for this to move.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is the one important thing that will anchor and present its heart and to North Long Beach. It's what represents us. We've lost a lot of things on there. There's a lot of vacant lots. And this is the first stop for a renaissance that will actually make North Long Beach shine.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Details the critical role of libraries in providing access to Americans living below the poverty line, the report stated. Orbital 44% of people in households living below the federal poverty line, which is 22,000 a year for a family of four, use public libraries, computers and Internet access among young adults 14 to 20 years of age.'",

In addition, System Benton, CEO of the Urban Libraries Council, adds Library libraries are economic engines for communities, helping people find jobs and gain the skills they need to get ahead in their careers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can tell you hundreds of facts about why a library matters, but I'm here to tell you. The please support this this program. And I want to thank you and I know this project and I want to thank you in advance for your support to the North Branch Library.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. City council members. City staff. My name's Curt Davis. I'm a ninth district council resident. Sorry, I'm a little tired. I'm glad you guys could last as long as we could also. When I was a kid, I was able to see the construction of the main branch library and also be able to go in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and enjoy the sense of being in a new place, seeing new books, seeing records, seeing just things that I could go on and feast on. I can see that this new library is going to give that hope to the children in my district also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they're going to have a better advantage to me. They're going to have access to computers. They're going to have access to things that we did that I couldn't even imagine when I was a kid. And I know that's really going to help us in this north district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, there's a lot of things going on, especially with the remodeling and the construction work going on at Jordan High. The library is going to fit in perfect with all that work that's going on in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I encourage you to support this contract and get this library going. I also encourage you to be sure that the funds are budgeted, to be sure that it's not only world class on the outside, but world class on the inside, that we have the proper books, the computers and all the things that we need inside that library'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Albert Jacob Massey. I'm president of AMG and Associates. Well, I'm probably the most least popular person here this evening. I do want to point out a few things my company does primarily 90% of public works projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see bid forms of all different types. We just recently completed the Linux Library for the County of Los Angeles. So we understand very, very clearly how important a library is for a community. And I can appreciate what everyone is saying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The issue is, is that you have a flawed bid form. And I would encourage that you take a look at your bid form because it is not in compliance with the public contract code. These are public funds, and it is the intent that all bidders receive the same consideration in presenting their bids to a public entity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, the things that I want you to think about as it relates to this project and the bidder that was apparently the low bidder, is that the if you took the average of all the bids submitted, the average bid amount is $12.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The wood cliff bid is approximately $1.4 million lower than the average bid amount. That's 11%. If I bid a project that is 11% low, I am radically concerned about the fact that did I leave something out? Am I going to be concerned about being able to have good subcontractors performing on the project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is it going to be problematic for me to make sure that everybody is performing correctly? Am I going to be able to meet my schedules? Am I going to be able to meet the demands of the project? My company is not going to interfere with the award of your project if you so choose to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our request from you is you need to evaluate your bid form because I think you have a flawed bid form, as I indicated previously, to have a bid form that takes and totals all of the sum amounts and have that be one number and then say, okay, my total bid amount is a different number, and then give'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a contractor the opportunity to evaluate if they can do the project by doing potentially bid shopping, which I don't know if if that's what Cliff has done or not, but be able to have a five day period to go out and try to seek other prices from subcontractors to see if they can do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Project is not a level playing field and that's what the intent is of the public contract code. So I would just encourage you to, if you decide to move forward with your project, I wish you the best of luck.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I would ask that your city attorney and your director of public works evaluate your bid form.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you. And good luck on your project if you go forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I've been I've lived in Long Beach since 1976. Actually, I grew up in Los Angeles. I remember those times when my mom and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would take the bus from 54th Street to downtown Los Angeles to the public library, and what an ideal it was. And I had older parents, and I'm the youngest of four children. And but the house was during that time, a project like this in Long Beach, a fabric that we've been waiting for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been a Long Beach resident four lived in the ninth District for 14 years. I think it's something that we've been waiting for for a long time and that all of the citizens can benefit from. And I would like to see this project move forward.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. With that, I'll turn it back over to Councilmember Richardson. And there is a motion on the floor.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'll turn it over to our public works director.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Thank you. I would like to respond to some of these questions or clear the air, basically. First, there's absolutely nothing wrong with our bid forms. It's been tested and used for hundreds of projects that we we use, and it's the same format.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'This project is actually even simpler than most our public works projects because we have multiple bid items, sometimes 50 or 60 items. This project had only 23 bid items and they were all lump sum. That means every contractor who did the job, they would have one number for that individual line item.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It's the previous our other public works projects. You would have X amount of linear miles of concrete or square footage of something. This is all lump sum. So there's absolutely no bid shopping. Shopping possible with this bid. Usually bid shopping happens after the bids.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And the lowest contractor will go and conduct that within its own suppliers or within its own subcontractors. In this case, they have not done any subs substitutions. Everything is fine. Lastly, AMG is not the next lowest bidder. The other 42 bidder.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Their bid is over 800,000. Above with Cliff and also there's another contractor which is lower than Angie. Lastly, to average the bids it's in or it's incorrect. The bids came very closely. That means the bid package was properly done, the plans were clear, and there were no confusion.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The difference between lowest, lowest and the next lowest bidder was 200,000. From the second to third was another 200,000. And then it jumps to AMG, which is $800,000 worth. Cliff made a mathematical error, which is when they totaled all the numbers in their lump sums, they made a math error, and when we did our bit tabulation, we'",
        "'speaker_14': 'find the error. We contacted them and they accept that accepted the mathematical error, which is minor, and they have not withdrawn from this, this, this application. Therefore, the they are the lowest responsive bidder. And I recommend that the council move forward with this contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Carl, for the previous question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So that there's no other comments, we have a motion on the floor, so we're going to go and take a vote on that motion. So, members, please go and cast your votes.'",
