And then the appointments that the Mayor makes are appointments that are community service and community driven appointments.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'our city. Just a bit of history. This is a really a long time coming. There was an ethics task force put together. I'm going to say maybe 15 years ago. And from that task force, this was a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then council member Barney Lowenthal asked for that task force to be put together and asked for study. And there was a lot of due diligence put him to place to to to look into ethics and establishing guidelines. I think one of the recommendations was to establish an ethics commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was this city council. It was the voters of the city that that made that happen. And so I just want to, again, take this opportunity to congratulate you, and you have my full confidence and support in your work moving forward.'",

The tool would provide updated real-time data on bed availability for shelters, rehab, detox, medical detox, and other types of public, private, and non-profit beds. The mobile and web-based applications would provide additional information to City of Long Beach employees and residents about services such as food pantries, showers, or locations to get ID vouchers.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. And with that, if I can just please ask the council to join us as we take a photo. So let's give them all a round of applause again. Well, thank you. We are moving on to our next item that's going to be item 16, which is an item by Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we can go to do that item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Item 16 is communications from Councilwoman Price Council member Pearce, Vice Mayor Andrews and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to require city manager to evaluate the feasibility of working with get help to develop City of Long Beach specific mobile web based applicant applications for city staff and Long Beach residents who work with or interact with those experiencing homelessness and report'",
        "'speaker_0': 'back within 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. If I can invite Dr. Tony Greco and former Councilman Mitch Englander to the podium. What I'd like to do is to have these two gentlemen give us an overview of this particular app and how it could be used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I'll save my comments for after they finish talking. But I did hear about, you know, we have residents all the time come up with come to us with solutions of, you know, how can we connect people better with services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when I saw an article in the paper about this app and its use in the city of L.A., that's when our office reached out to Dr. Greco. So I thank you for being here. I'm going to turn it over to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Thank you very much. Honorable mayor, councilmembers and Councilmember Price, thanks for reaching out as well. I will say, though, that Los Angeles is number one. As a former L.A. city councilmember, we were number one. We are number one in homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Make no mistake. I don't think anybody can argue with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's not to go for that title.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Yes. Well, you've achieved it. And and you're doing a lot here. And I can I congratulate each and every one of you for what you're doing to to tackle this epidemic and this moral dilemma of our lifetime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the reason I'm here is as a councilmember and the chair of Public Safety and president pro tem of the L.A. City Council was certainly something that I was personally dealing with every single day. In fact, I myself as a child was homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this is near and dear to me. And while everybody in Los Angeles at the time, a few years ago, when I was looking at what options and what opportunities and what tools do we have, everyone was talking about housing, and that's critically important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Make no mistake, we have a tremendous crisis and housing shortage and rents are way too high and it's very difficult. And so many people who are housed are right on the edge of homelessness themselves. But what are the tools and the different obstacles and issues and ways to get people help?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It didn't exist. And in fact, when I graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy, I was given a book, a resource directory. By the time I was given, that resource directory had already been ten years old out of print.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was some 16 years ago, and I haven't gotten an update ever since. And so I looked at what's out there in the space, and I tried to create an app myself, an app that would be geo coded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you stop somebody on the street, when you're trying to help somebody, whether it's a first responder, a clergy member, a teacher, a nurse, and they need resources. They need a domestic violence shelter. They need a homeless shelter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They need a food bank. They need a work source center. And to know what's around you close by that's open and available with all the information didn't exist. So I reached out to everybody I knew and it wasn't there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I created it myself and it failed miserably. I worked on it, put my own funds into it, and spent years on it. Didn't work. Not to my delight. And so I scoured the universe and what was out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I met with Google. I met with big tech companies, could not find anything we were looking for that would actually have in real time geocoding what's there to help people. It didn't exist. And so in talking everywhere about this, somebody introduced me to Dr. Greco, who actually created the very thing that I was looking for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it has been piloted with the Los Angeles Police Department and many others that love it, that have said that it's one of the most valuable tools on their tool belt, the ability in real time to get people information and help, particularly when dealing with the three P's, their personal belongings, their partners and their pets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of people are service resistant, but it's just because you have a moment in time to get their information, to help them, to give them the resources, to give them a referral before you lose them. And so you have to capture that moment, particularly if they have mental health issues or drug addiction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They need help. And it's not just always a shelter bed, but it's also a shelter bed. And knowing what beds are available in real time, where close by. So with that, I want to thank you very much, Councilwoman, for looking into this for Long Beach, being on the cutting edge and and trying to help as many people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as you possibly can all the time. You've been setting the example for other cities that I've certainly looked to as well. So I truly appreciate it with that. Dr. Greco. Thank you. I am Dr. Tony Greco, and it's an honor and privilege to be here today.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'My mom didn't stay sober.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the time. And my dad was dealing with mental illness. And what I what I tell people a lot when I'm telling my story is that I've been trying to get people into treatment in some way or another since I was seven years old.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I was intimately familiar with how difficult and challenging it was and also intimately familiar with what happens when people don't get help.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as a result of my my parents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Own issues with addiction and mental illness. I myself was homeless at 15 and didn't.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And that was only by the grace of. Many people. And so since 17 I've been trying to get that my whole life has been dedicated to trying to help people both in recovery, family members of those involved. And I've known how.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Difficult it was in that moment that Mitch was talking about, that moment when somebody wants help and how difficult it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When all you've got are a couple either people that you can call or outdated phone lists or anything like that and that really. Set the direction in my life.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. That's why I got a doctorate in psychology was I figured they're the ones, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the licensed professionals, the doctors, they're the ones that no other way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Around the system. They're the ones that that know the secret handshake or whatever that is. And what I discovered is that not only did it not make it any.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Easier to get people help, but now it made it harder because I had more people asking and even less resources. And that was the foundation for me. Founding Get Help was to be able to create resources and give people that that in that window, in that moment of time when when they need help to give people like'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Myself, psychologists, therapists, social workers, you know, I did my internship and worked in the county facilities and and to give all of us the tools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That we needed so that in that moment of time, we'd be able to get help for people who needed it, because that's that moment and that's when people do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'End up homeless as a result of not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Being able to find a resource that they need. And sometimes it's not shelter, sometimes it's detox, sometimes it's it's a warm meal, you know, or a shower or something. And that's enough to give them hope to go on to the next day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And then the next day is when they say, maybe I'll try that mental health facility. And so that's really been the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Foundation of get help is for us to be able to provide resources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the professionals, the first responders, the people that are out in the field on the front line, and make sure that that data is accurate and up to date and can give people exactly what they need in that moment when it can make the difference between life and death.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for letting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me be here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you to both of you. So I'm just going to make a few comments on this, and I know my colleagues want to speak as well. Thank you to the residents who are here tonight and support as and those who have written our office and filed comments and also emailed me over the last week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of course, to Dr. Greco and Councilman Englander for being here tonight. Looking at more efficient approaches to homelessness is an incredibly important to this city and to cities throughout the state. What I'm proposing tonight is the creation through the help of partners to create an app that provides real time services and bed availabilities for services to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the homeless. If we can put these types of services in the hands of our city, teams that work directly with the homeless population as well as our first responders, like police and fire, we can really improve the efficiency of getting people into the services they need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As someone who routinely goes on outreach ride alongs, both in the city of Long Beach and throughout Orange County, with the Orange County Community Officers Group, throughout the 33 agencies, and as a prosecutor who often staffs and also manages the collaborative courts, including our drug court and homeless court programs, I've seen firsthand how important outreach can be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in building trust and credibility with people suffering from homelessness. The amount of time and repeated contacts that are necessary to build those relationships is essential as we work to get people off the streets. Our outreach done out of the Multi-Service Center and by our police and fire department is incredible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, our outreach teams would absolutely benefit from having real time updated information for bed availabilities where they can immediately route someone or transport someone to. Sometimes that window where someone has a moment of clarity can be brief. And if we're lucky enough to have an outreach officer reach out at exactly that moment, we cannot miss the opportunity'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because the officer had to call around looking for somewhere that would admit the homeless individual at that exact moment or risk the individual losing faith in the system or in the officer because they weren't able to follow through quickly enough.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've been on so many ride alongs where individuals have said that they want help, they want to go to detox, but that they were not ready at that moment or we didn't have a bed for them at that moment and they've asked us to come back and when we've gone back, the person's been gone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This technology based solutions means that we can quickly and effectively allow our officers and outreach teams to access information they need in real time in order to give the people the services that they need immediately. City cities across the country are looking at moving forward with creative, technology based approaches to homelessness, and this is one of them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Los Angeles is currently undergoing a pilot program that they are proposing to extend because of how successful and useful this app has been for their outreach teams and first responders. Apps like this not only help get people the help they need, but get them used to the idea of accepting services, trusting and building credibility with first responders'",
        "'speaker_3': '. They may not be ready to accept detox treatment today, but they may be ready to accept shelter. Or maybe they're not ready for shelter, but they're ready for a food bank. Or maybe they're not ready for shelter, but they simply want assistance or an opportunity to talk with others who are going through a similar thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having access to what is available at that moment is critical for our first responders and for the homeless population in the city of Long Beach. I ask my colleagues to support this item, but more importantly, I ask my colleagues to support a commitment by this Council to to direct resources at providing help for the homeless so that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they can be given the opportunity to get the treatment they need at the moment that they decide they need that help. And although it's a different topic and not part of this particular item, I do believe that having services 24 hours, seven days a week available for our homeless population and our outreach officers to be able to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'contact them seven days of the week is an important priority for the city, given what we're hearing from our constituents as a priority for them as well. So I think I thank the presenters and the members of the city who have reached out to us and I thank my councils in advance for their support, my council colleagues'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I definitely signed on to this item because I know how challenging it can be to create an app like this. In 2016, we had nearly 100 people do a day of service. They did a hackathon to try to create an app very similar to this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is difficult to find the right technology, particularly in places when we have HIPA and we have privacy concerns. And so when you have a vulnerable population like our homeless population, we have to think creatively. We have to think outside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of the box. And so taking what's worked and building on that, I think is an exciting opportunity for all of us. I think that our entire city has said over and over that dealing with homelessness as a public health issue and not as any other type of issue is their priority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so while I love the item, as is, I know that there's been some ideas around expanding not just where are their beds, where are their basic services, where are their socks, where are their clothes, where are things that they can pick up if they're not ready for those services?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But maybe we connect them with geo and the socks that they're doing and the homeless services around creating jobs to create those socks. And so I look forward to seeing what staff brings back. I hope that this is an app like many other apps, so we can have a phase one, phase two and phase three where it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just gets better with each development. So I wholeheartedly support this item and I encourage our community groups. I know there are some here in the room that have participated in that hackathon to try to create that app. I hope that our city staff will work with Long Beach organizations as well to kind of see what's already worked'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and what they've had a trial and error on. And I can work with staff afterwards to connect you with those groups. So thank you very much, Councilwoman, for bringing this forward item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, County Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I'm going to say less because I think my colleague, Suzy Price, council member, probably said most of what needed to be said. I think our presentation was excellent and I am fully in support of this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think this Get Help app is very, very intriguing as we are working as a city to create more bed space and create more resources, we need tools to help us manage our resources and be smarter and more efficient with everything that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just had a question regarding the capabilities or capacity. This this is not or is this just limited to public resources? Or or can we we look to engage our faith based organizations who are doing work around the homelessness issues, nonprofits and other private partners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I can answer that question. So if the city chooses to go forward and identifies the funding to start a pilot, then we'll work with the app developer to define our parameters. What can be included and what I would be recommending be included is nonprofits as well as government based resources, not just in Long Beach, but within'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the region. Because, for example, we have very few medical detox beds, but there are cities within the region that have medical detox beds, and we don't sometimes know immediately if there's a bed available. So this would allow us to go within the region, even outside of the county.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if there's a bed in lossL or there's a bed in SEAL Beach, then we would be able to transport, help somebody get services there through transportation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is much better and this is an advancement on anything that we have today in terms of tools. And so this is a great start and I'm fully support. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Susie Price for bringing this forward. I think this is an excellent opportunity for the city to really get engaged in dealing in and confronting homelessness. One of the biggest. Progress that we can make is having opportunities for people experiencing homelessness or mental health issues or drug or detox issues is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'admitting that there's a problem. That's the first step as it was a process goes. And a lot of times all they want is not a handout, but a hand up. And this is application would be able to provide that with them in the sense that it's simple.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They come to somebody and says, you know, I need help. Where do I go? This application, I think, would be very beneficial in providing that kind of assistance. So I'm glad that this brought forward looking forward to the city, to the cities, evaluating this and looking into it and hopefully that we can get this on board as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'quickly as possible, because as we know, every day we talk, there's another homeless person on the street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you. I remember the first day that I was assigned to the Lakewood Station after I got out of the sheriff's academy and we went into a homeless camp. And I will tell you that in a region as big as Long Beach, I mean, we are a large city and an officer may be on overtime on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the east side, but usually works downtown and they might not know those resources. And so I feel like this app is a phenomenal opportunity to really put the technology in our hands. I would also say that in some ways it would be great if it could plug into another resource or app that is already available to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'officers. There's already so many different technologies they're working with on a daily basis. I hope that we're mindful of the amount of connectivity that they have and how that all fits together, because it can be cumbersome to our new recruits, especially who are out there on the field every day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you to Councilman Price for bringing this forward. It is a a critical component of what we can do, but also highly recommend as we work through this and get some cost outs what the long term commitments are and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Finding a way to ensure that, as we talked about, it can scale and grow over time to the needs of the community. And perhaps that we could then have other cities or other agencies adopt in and help us pay for those costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Great work and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. And so in looking at this item, I think it's very well written, all the references and you know, as you know, as I'm out on other boards and commissions and it's gag, folks, pay attention to what Long Beach is doing around the homelessness issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And particularly around the last homeless count. Folks were asking, what's Long Beach doing differently? And I think what we're doing differently is continuing to innovate and continuing to focus on this issue and really lock arms and support it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so, Councilwoman Price, I think this is a great step in the right direction. I also want to want to just lift up what Councilwoman Mongo just said. I know that we're you know, our firefighters move into different applications.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so there's ongoing conversations within the health department. So the more we can think about integration, you know, one comprehensive system, the better off our our whole collaborative system will be. The last thing is, I know that, and I would just hope that this is sort of there's a level of sort of privacy we work out with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'outreach workers. And I wouldn't want to see this link in any way to like go Long Beach. Right. So I wouldn't want any residents taking photos of incoming encampments or or anything like that. And I know that's not the intention here, but I think as we lift it up that the people who use this are professionals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right? These are people who can actually help people in need. And I think that's important to call out. But this has my support. I think it's a very well thought out item and I look forward to supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Councilman Richardson. And, you know, I also would like to thank my colleague, you know, Councilman Price, for bringing this to the, you know, item forward, because the fact that Long Beach, you know, is in the middle of a one of the homeless crisis that we need to use every tool at our disposal to help try'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to solve this problem. You know, using technology to identify solutions is an innovative way to enable our hard team match up with the homeless, which is available spots to help them return to society. You know, I'm urging my colleagues to join us in supporting of this item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Colleagues, I just wanted to end with a few comments. First of all, while I appreciate and respect the thanks, it's not thanks to me. Every single person on this council has been working really hard for the past four years to find solutions that are impacting all of our communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is just part of a larger team effort and a larger discussion. I will say to Councilman Austin, I forgot to include that private providers can also be included in this system. So hospitals and, you know, other types of treatment, rehab centers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The problem with those is that they may not all accept, you know, they may have different insurance requirements and things. So we want to make sure that that those who don't have the means are able to get into those resources, but that can be included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also say that, gosh, about three weeks ago, four weeks ago, I was invited to be the keynote speaker and my day job as a prosecutor at the Orange County Community Officers Meeting. They modeled a program in Orange County similar to our quality of life officers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here, there's 33 police agencies in Orange County. Every police agency now has a quality of life officer. They don't call them quality of life officers. They call them community officers, and they have an association of community officers. So I invited our Quality of Life team and our East Division commander to go to the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was a there was over 100 people in the room and they were all talking about the same things that I read on next door and that same things that I hear at my community meetings. And I had to take a pause for a moment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was standing in front of the group giving them a presentation about different misdemeanor offenses that we often see in quality of life type situations with our transient population. And I took a pause as I was looking out this entire room filled with police officers, and I said, you know, they didn't know this about me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I said in my other hat, I'm a councilwoman in a city, and I go to a lot of community meetings. And I have to tell you, one of the most common things I hear at community meetings from my residents is why is this only a problem in Long Beach and not a problem in Orange County?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they all started laughing. You can ask Commander O'Dowd, because the same exact issues we have here, in fact, the Newport Beach officers were there. I said in my my city, my residents are always telling me this isn't a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In Newport Beach, they said, actually, our homeless count revealed we have 67 while 67, compared to the population they have in Newport Beach, would be proportional to the population. We have given that we have almost 500,000 residents. So it was really interesting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They had the same issues that we do with encampments at the railroads because, you know, the railroads run through all through Orange County and a lot of the same issues in terms of enforcement. So, you know, I was really happy to see that some of the things that were doing, they were looking to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Learn from they. Many of them didn't have standing, no trespass orders like we have here for our business corridors. They asked us to send ours to them so they can model it after that. So it was very and I've invited many, many residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anytime you want to go to one of those meetings with me there once a month, I'm happy to take you with me. But I think an app like this is honestly a game changer for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the area of homelessness, there are so many different aspects to homelessness. But if we can't get people connected to services when they're ready for services, they will lose faith in the system and our outreach efforts will not be as effective.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you, colleagues, for all of your comments and thank you to all of you for your ongoing efforts on this issue. It's not about this item or me or anybody. It's all of us working together to find a common, common solutions for this problem that we're all facing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Councilwoman. I'm going to go to public comment. I have eight speakers. I want to ask the first four to come up Luke Cardenas, Katie, Della, Donna, Wil Cullen and Marco Pizzo. You four can please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And please begin. Luke Cardenas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Good evening. My name is Luke Cardenas, the Louis Vuitton Apostle.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A special messenger of the Louis Vuitton kingdom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am here to advocate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the recommendation of the new.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Digital app that would allow police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And fire personnel real time data on what beds are available at various shelters to better assist the homeless. This is a progressive step to reduce human suffering, and I urge council members to search your hearts and indeed your souls and approve this recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are watching the gap grow between extreme wealth and extreme poverty. With such wealth available, it is morally apprehensively that in this, the 21st century, we are stepping over bodies in the streets and having to smell human waste throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need more public showers to clean those on the streets and more safe and clean shelters to house them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In Palm Springs, for example. There is a water truck that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Drives around with portable showers for the homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As well as a clothing exchange program where the homeless trade their clothing to be washed and then redistributed. We need more creative.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Solutions like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Taking care of the least of us isn't merely the moral thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'According to police officers I've spoken to. It would help the businesses that currently suffer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From the blight the homeless individuals can bring. Caring for the needy also reduces crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Desperation fuels crimes against property. Imagine a city where we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can walk around safer not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Having to smell human waste and not having to step over bodies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I urge you to please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Approve this recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Take this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Proper step to help those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In need and let us continue to reduce human suffering. Let us solve the manmade problem of homelessness. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'May the universe be abundant to you all. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Katie, Della, Donna, Naples, Neighborhood Watch. Thank you, Susie Price for bringing this recommendation forward. I'm all for it. I would mirror everything you say, but I don't want to waste time. One point I want to bring up is it's not just about the detox beds and the rehab beds, which we know were limited.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's really just a bed. Sometimes at 10:00 at night when an officer approaches someone, he can't offer them a bed. If he doesn't know that the Salvation Army has one more. Or Catholic Charities has one more. So I think it's important that all the officers have this on their phone so they can access it and get anyone'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to bed when they need it. And I also think it's important that we interface with all of the homeless shelters and get some sort of system organized so that we can allow people in the door at any time because people need beds at 9:00 at night and 10:00, not just till four or 5:00 in the afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would hope that when they develop the app, they consider that and consider negotiating with these homeless shelters and what we can do to get their doors to be open whenever an officer needs it. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope you all vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next speaker I am Marco Pizzo. I'm from the Bluff Park Historic District and I wanted to just thank you all for considering this great idea and for Suzy Price to Councilwoman Price to bring this forward. I just wanted to show my support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wrote any comment. I didn't know if it went through, but I just wanted to say that I do support this application and I think it's a great idea in being on the forefront of homelessness, which I know we're always trying to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you very much for your consideration and I hope you all vote for this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Marco is the next four speakers. Jeff, Jeff Malin, Joe Ganim, Matt Simmons, Anthony Kennedy. Please come forward. In that order. Mr. MALLABY first and then Mr. Garnham.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, counsel, and thank you for this proposal. Councilwoman Pryce. I am Jeff. I'm in also the third district Councilwoman Price's district in the Bluff Park historic district. And I. I think I wholly support this proposal. I will just say briefly, as a as a person in health care, myself, as a pediatrician, myself, I am looking at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it from the perspective of of those people that are actually trying to get services for the homeless people, the people that need detox, that kind of thing. I can speak from my own perspective. Many years ago, when our system at Kaiser Permanente was not as connected as it was, it would be very difficult for me to call'",
        "'speaker_2': 'around and find beds for my pediatric patients that needed hospitalization. I think something like this and our system has evolved as well with personnel and technology. I think something like this moves that bar and makes the lives of all of us much better.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you so much for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much next week.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. It's a pleasure to be here. Your new surroundings. I'm Joe Ganim. I spent nearly four years on the Homeless Services Advisory Committee as a commissioner. I was also on the Continuum of Care Board, and I was a board member for the Long Beach Coalition for the Homeless.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm very excited about this because to me this could be very well the beginning of the end of homelessness. And I don't say that lightly because quite honestly, what you're talking about now is finally putting all the disparate parts together where they can be accessed by the very people that are needing those services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Health Department does an outstanding job, and they have won awards nationally on the work that they've done. They have a computerized system, the HMAS, that provides them with critical data, but it's not available to everybody. Your app that you're talking about developing can link those services.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In addition to that, there are very simple things that occur, which I can see this later. I don't want to get away from your original purpose, but I believe you'll find that agencies, nonprofits, churches and so forth that are would be eventually participating in some way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of them will have resources that other ones need. I recall attending a commission meeting one day when the chair came rushing out of the parking lot running in, and he was running late and from the time he had left where he was to the time he'd come to the mission meeting, somebody called him to say, Hey'",
        "'speaker_10': ', I've got 12 crates of crates of apples and I don't know what to do with them. And he had found he knew other people and he'd contacted. But had he not been able to do that personally, those 12 crates of apples would have rotted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so this is what we're doing. We have tremendous resources. By linking them together with this app, I think you will be able to do some amazing things. I personally am a believer or a strong believer in technology.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My wife of 42 years has to tolerate living with two other women, Alexa and Siri. But but it also has its benefits. And so I think by by finally linking up all these available resources in this community that have heretofore not really always talked to each other, it's not because they're mad.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They just know what the other one was doing. You're finally bringing the what what I think of as a potential into homelessness in Long Beach. And I congratulate all of you for participating. I think you're about to approve this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm going to get off of here so you can do that. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Matt Simmons. I am president of Semtech Solutions, and I applaud this initiative to bring the tech into the hands of the people. They're trying to do this good work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason why I am at the podium is I do want to ask and encourage that the community look to put this out for public comment and for a bid because there are other technologies out there and the bid process itself will help flush out some of the challenges that have not yet been surfaced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The data integration required to link up the app with Service Point Your homeless management information system is significant. If you want real time information to be exchanged to be in the hands of the people that need it the most, there is a process that needs to happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Sky, the vendor for service point their capacity to share data back with any app is limited and so I would encourage fleshing that out. Resource directories are out there and birth is a common one you can look at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have an app, it's also out there called Show the Way. It's on the App Store and Google Play and it's meant to be put in the hands of outreach workers. And it's not just a resource directory. So I just mentioned it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I competition can breed innovation. May the best man woman company win because in the end we all win by helping the people that need it the most. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. And our last speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hello. City councilman and honorable mayor. My name is tonight Ken Faye from Sixth District. Uh, I want to, um, first say that I want to thank the, uh, Councilwoman Woman Price for bringing this, uh, agenda item up. And I think that this is a great opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Uh, have another tool in our toolbox of solutions to help with the homelessness and housing crisis that we're currently facing right now. Um, I, I, uh, signed up to comment specifically on some concerns that I have in regards to, um, uh, Texas, uh, as we just heard in the previous texts, uh, maybe excitement and uh, possibly the'",
        "'speaker_9': ', the future of privatization of services like this. Um, it's, it's a little bit concerning. Um, because this program is something similar to this program was tried out at San Diego County where they also, um, uh, did a lot of connection with uh, uh, law enforcement in regards to like uh, uh, thermal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Imagery to, to, they use the data points that they got.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From these similar apps to then do drone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh, flyovers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To then, uh, calculate thermal technology to verify the point. I think it's called point in. That's a look it up. It's called like a point in play. It's the HUD requirement for proving that someone is homeless.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look it up later. But the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Point that I have is that it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uh. It's a little worrying to see, uh.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Uh, a digital solution to an analog problem come up. Um, from, for me, in my personal opinion, the great solution to this crisis that we're living through is, you know, housing, building more shelters, building more affordable housing, building more options for people to live in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For me the cities to get involved in this looking towards the right honorable city attorney. There are concerns regards to possible liability concerns here because, you know, I don't know, this is just a pilot program, but I don't know to the extent of what get.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Help will do with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The data that that the acquiring in the process of this. You know, this is a pilot program and this is a public benefit corporation that could just as easily go from being a nonprofit nonprofit into a for profit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if we as a city allow allocate any kind of city funds to partner with this organization, there should be some serious security guidelines with regards to the data points that are acquired during the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The year of this program. That's all I would like to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. That concludes public comment. Before we go, we're going to go to a vote. I want to just make a couple of comments. I think that when I was on the council, one of the apps that really kind of changed the way we do business was the lobby, John.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I remember bringing that forward and working with Mr. Modica and other members of the team to try to kind of rethink the way we did services for residents. And without question, the Golden Beach app has changed the way public works and our code enforcement and our clean teams work today because of the work of our city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'staff and the way the public has embraced that, I think I mean, there are tens of thousands of people that use the Golden Beach app, and we have opened and closed tens of thousands of cases, probably close to 100,000 cases by now at this point, I imagine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when I saw this, I really was very supportive and really thought this was a great approach. I've heard of other types of technology kind of applications, but, you know, this had not been brought to this body before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank Councilwoman Pryce. I think this is a great opportunity for the city to engage in using technology to help solve a very real and serious challenge. It is the single biggest challenge we have in front of us today is is helping folks get into housing, get mental help, the mental health care they need, and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'provide residents with an opportunity to help us all solve this challenge together. And so I think this is a great idea and very supportive. And I want to thank Councilwoman Pryce and those that support this item as well.'",

And to have this come up two years earlier than expected really speaks volumes, I think, of the leadership at our convention center, the leadership with SMG and the leadership on this council and with city staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a is a day in history that we should be proud of. And we've often talked about what conventions we can get in the city of Long Beach. And so many have been left off of the table because we didn't have enough hotel rooms, because we didn't have a good protection at our convention center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what's most important about this is that this is the city really also saying we have to protect our proprietary interests. The same conversation we have at the port, which is how do we have a city owned facility and how can we make sure that there's not going to be a labor stoppage, a strike or something like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that could keep money from coming into our city. And so this is absolutely the right track. I'm very proud of everyone doing this work, and so I really want to applaud the council in 2013. But the leadership that's at our convention center now, I know it wasn't an easy road to get here, and I know that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our convention center is going to be better off today for it. I also know that there are other people that have asked to have a voice with SMG, and I want to thank you guys for already setting up those meetings to make sure that we will not have a labor stoppage at our convention center at any given'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, when these conventions and conferences come to the city, I think the way that we deal with our workgroups and the commitments we make to quality jobs, I think it makes a lot of sense for Long Beach to be a town where it's convention center and convention center vendors are union.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's I think that's okay for us to say that and to make that commitment. So congratulations to all those involved. I think this is this makes sense for Long Beach. And again, this is probably the best way that this there was no drama.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Folks are here. There's no big, you know, crowd of folks. There's no high stakes politics. Folks have just they have an agreement and it reflects Long Beach's values. So congratulations to all of you and happy to support this.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'It was a very contentious meeting, and it didn't work out very well. But I do I will like to echo the comments that it is great to have the the entities in Long Beach reflect the city's values and we should not be shamed to ever stand up for union job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The good jobs and the people that work and serve this city, that make this city look good, that put on conventions, should really benefit in the economic prosperity of our city. And I can tell you that our convention and visitors bureau, our convention industry has has really helped define this city and will continue to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know this decision today will be one of economic interest for the city in a positive way. So I'm happy to support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. And just to conclude, I just want to add, because I think, Councilman, you recenter this where it needs to be. And I want to just not just congratulate all the parties, but I do want to congratulate the workers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as we close to the workers at the convention center that are there working very hard. We have the best team at that convention center of hard working folks, many of them from Long Beach back putting their their money back into our local economy and knowing that that in the future, their their jobs will be will be'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I think one to on the side of being open, being balanced and erring on the side of more information than less.

        "'speaker_3': 'Because in my opinion, it's a great topic, really talking about an issue that's a national issue of automation and productivity. And so I don't know. In terms of the impact to the city, who who would be the best person to do that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The report thanks for arising in conversations with the port. I think they understand that we're asking them to conduct they can sort of partner with them on that process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Got it. Excellent. Thank you. The other question that I had and I don't know if our staff has the answer for this. I know I saw Mr. Cordero here earlier, but do we know are there any productivity metrics that are built into the leases so that we can have objective data?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because there's a lot of recent research that has come out of late suggesting that automation doesn't necessarily mean more productivity. So what kind of data do we have built into our leases where we could measure those kinds of metrics?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If anyone knows, I'd love to see that in the report, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. My hope is the conduct report come back to us and we have we can have a full conversation on all of this. So that certainly we can include that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I mean, I think that's a really important part of this discussion. This is this is a national discussion that's impacting so many industries in so many different areas. And I think one of the most important things for us to think about is a huge part of the labor force, are residents of this city in all of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our districts. And when we're talking about a topic such as automation, you know, does that necessarily mean more productivity? How are we measuring that? Because there's there's a lot of research out there that says the work that's done by the worker can produce a more productive outcome for the industry as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, I worry about when we talk about things like automation, which I'm very supportive of us advancing in our technologies and moving forward. But we're talking about displacement of workers. That's that's a huge, huge contributor to our city's local economy and the life and welfare, not just of the people who live here, but those who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'spend money here as well. So, you know, I really want to make sure that we support policies that are proven to be effective in terms of the direction we're headed. And I look forward to being educated on that topic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've been reading a lot of research on this topic, especially in the area of goods movement. I think Mr. Cordeiro knows I'm really interested in this topic in regards to the port and the impacts of local policies on the port and the workers at the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I do try to keep up on that and I will say that automation is an issue that's not just affecting our port, but every port in the country and in the world and is going to be something that we're going to have to be very cognizant of in terms of the impact, not just to the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'workers, to the industry, but to both. So I thank you for bringing this project forward. I'm I'm thankful that we're going to be working with the harbor department on this, because I really do think, you know, for me, I look to our harbor commissioners a lot for guidance in terms of their area of expertize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And certainly I believe that they're in the best position to understand the impact of any policies that are made on the labor force as well as on the tenants. And to strike a balance that's that's fair and takes into consideration the needs of the city as we continue to grow our local economy, our revenue base, and our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'protect our homeowners and our our residents and visitors who shop here. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I'm glad to see this idea of this item come before us today. I want to thank those who brought it forward. And for those of you who know my background, I grew up in Detroit for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I come from a family of autoworkers. I've experienced this this issue of automation myself. I moved to California and a few years later worked in the aerospace industry right here in Long Beach, was a member of the UAW Local 148, and we had 23,000 members in 1989.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. There's no members today. And many of those workers were impacted not just by the market, but automation as well. And so I don't need a study to tell me that automation impacts jobs. It impacts neighborhoods and impacts quality of life and communities and impact cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Detroit Long Beach are examples of how major job losses in manufacturing industries have impacts and the ILWU. There are many members who live in my neighborhood or my neighbors, folks who depend on jobs in the maritime industry. This is a this is something worthy of our attention.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just want to thank the writers of this motion. I think that is a great opportunity to reinforce the great work of our workers that are at the port and to really talk about how we've made great strides with the leadership and the Port Commission on what they're doing to address the issues that they've had'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the past and the solutions of optimizing our terminal gates and Pier Pass 2.0 and all the other things that you guys are doing. It's just only one part of a bigger picture. And so I look forward to this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My initial question I cued up for was fiscal impact. But I think Councilmember Richardson's comment that this would be in partnership with the port would mean that the fiscal impact to the Long Beach side of the budget would be insignificant in nature.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so for that, I'm appreciative of the clarification and I look forward to reading the study. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just really quick question for the maker of the motion. In terms of scope is and I think I heard you mentioned earlier that that you wanted it to be broad. Is there a certain level of latitude that you give in stuff to look at in terms of economic impacts?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And job impacts overall.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'd like to get a clear picture. I'd like to. I'd like it to be focused in on Long Beach. I'd like to hear about the impacts to our local communities. If you have to frame that within the broader context of the region or what you know, the impacts from a regional standpoint of automation are there you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, is there an idea based on phasing like we just need to get a better picture to understand if that means that the study is maybe to part or if they come back and say, hey, we can engage in this level of study, come back, then gets us, gets the conversation going.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's fine. I think the idea here is that. We you know, we want to work with the board here. We want to engage in a smart dialog. We do value workers. We need to understand a lot more and we have a lot more questions to ask.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the point here is the sort of beginning discussion around the context of economic impact and a study on this issue within our report.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'First, PMA looks forward to working with the city, with the port.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of Long Beach should you decide to conduct a study on port automation? We have commissioned some excellent studies ourselves on the topic, which we're happy to share. We believe any study.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of automation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Should consider its impact on the port's competitive standing, including its ability to attract and retain and retain discretionary cargo. A recent study found that 60,000 workers in Southern California relied directly on discretionary cargo coming through the San Pedro Bay ports.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We believe it's also important to study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What happens without automation. This includes potential financial financial risk to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City and the poor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Related to the Alameda corridor. And specifically on bonds issued by the Aluminum Corridor Transportation Authority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the cash flow deficits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Projected if cargo market share continues to decline. In addition, we encourage the study to focus on automation as role in achieving the port's environmental goals. And finally, PM is happy to provide information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About our collective bargaining agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the automation provisions it contains.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Thanks. Next speaker, please. And is William Simmons. And then after William would be Martin certain if I can please have after Mr.. Mr. Rich Dines, David Ross, Gary Herrera, Sydney Ken Fee and David Tirado.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ALL Please come to the microphone next speaker. Martin. Yes? It's William Heymans here. No, Mr.. Sort of. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello, everybody. I would like.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To. Marty, sort of. I'm a norther north Long Beach resident. I would like to point out some of the things that were commented on. This absolutely is a national issue. There are Oxford reports and Brooking Institute reports that state that we've lost over 5 million jobs to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Air power automation since 2002 and we are on pace to lose 10 to 5 million more jobs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Across the nation in the next ten or 15.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Years. This problem will absolutely be exponential.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now, some of the things that have not been pointed out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'More recently, APM Terminals has decided to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Automate 90% of their work away. That's going to be 5 to.'",
        "'speaker_6': '700 jobs lost daily. Okay. We are. Or is it? We have over a.'",
        "'speaker_2': '$300 million lost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On their lease agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Over $300 million lost. I think that was in one year in the first year. And that's based.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the cargo and the volume that's.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Going to slow the throughput. Right, as I understand it. We make money off of in taxes. Right. So the volume and the production of this automated facility is cut in half, 50%. I think that absolutely needs to be looked into.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not including.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The like I said, the tax payer revenue, the jobs that are going to be lost as well. Um, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Dinesen. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, members of Council for the opportunity to address you this evening. My name is Rich Dines. My addresses is on file and I'll give you the Reader's Digest version. I speak in support of AB 1321 and the need for an economic impact study to help understand how much revenue the City of Long Beach would lose due'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to foreclosures, bankruptcies and small business closings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If our public part becomes automated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I recommend an independent academic based study be contracted by the port to avoid any political influences. Proponents of automating our port claim it is necessary to achieve the goals of the cleaner action plan. They claim it is needed to add efficiencies and increase productivity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those claims are completely false. As you know, I provided a lot of input on the cleaner action plan. The port does not require any automation or electrification to achieve its cleaner goals. The port continues to be fuel and technology neutral.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, alternative fuels such as renewable natural gas, can meet the same zero emission standards adopted by the California Air Resources Board as an electric vehicle. The Cleaner Action Plan also pushes for operational efficiencies, including a goal of moving 50% of all containers by on dock rail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No robot can compete with IOW workforce where the most productive and efficient longshore workforce in the world. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Dines. Mr. Ross.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, commissioners. My name is David Ross, and back in 1911, Long Beach was entrusted with the title Land Trust Act. It allows the citizens of Long Beach to have control over the port and the revenue and what source of income is coming through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We as the people of Long Beach deserve to know and they should be transparent on what impact automation will have on the future of our economy and all our local businesses and anything coming into the ports. Because, as you know, most ports are owned by foreign companies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by eliminating jobs at a high rate, we only they save money. No one else does. And what exactly and how much is it going to affect us all? APM Terminals, for example, wants to fully automate, as Richard has said, and in their port master plan, there was no information regarding how much jobs were lost and how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'many jobs could be gained. And this trend can keep going on without any effect on us at all. As you already know, there's a homeless issue going on in Long Beach and in Los Angeles. If if automation is to continue at a rapid rate, we have no idea what can affect us now with smaller jobs, with long'",
        "'speaker_2': ', short jobs being affected, and any longshoreman that spend money in communities and in restaurants and mom and shop shops. Restaurants or shops. Sorry, but. I feel the need to push this agenda through so that we have at least transparency going forward with any automation project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think every community should be involved with this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening and thank you for having us here tonight. Thank you for putting us on the agenda. My name is Gary Herrera. I'm vice president of the Iaw Local 13. And I just want to touch upon a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did I hear here tonight? I hear very greatly that you guys care about your community and you do a lot of us who live across the bridge over there come over here and we support the business because you have such a great community and because of that, you're able to thrive because of us that have jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We talk about the homelessness problem. Homeless. Homelessness will only increase when there's no jobs. Right now, we're looking at losing anywhere between 570 jobs across the bay over there. Right now, we lost jobs here. It'll be because of automation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you continue to automate over here in Long Beach, there'll be further job loss, which will contribute to further homelessness. Small businesses failing your community that is thriving so well. Going backwards, we heard some testimony that it could be more competitive with automation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a McKinsey report, report that you can look in your own and it will tell you that is not did it is not give you more productivity. As a matter of fact, it was said to us over the L.A. Harbor Commission, the APM will not be more competitive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They will not be more productive. It was about getting rid of labor. I was in that meeting. So what I'm telling you today is a truth. Also, we've heard there's other terminals here in Long Beach that have converted their machines for clean air with the human driving them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're asking to this report go through. You look at the economic value and the environmental value that we can all work together on this and keep humans working. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please. My name is and I can say.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know. Hundreds of years ago, coastal towns across the world, they were plagued.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By a, uh, an invasion of, uh.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of, uh, an entity called the Vikings. This is the modern day version. It's just a p molar instead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But going back to the roots, it's the same exact plot. Here we have an opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Much like, uh, the, um, the councilman over just across the shore, the 15th District. Uh, Mr. Schiano, you know, it's, this is an opportunity for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our city to step up to the plate and really.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Strive and work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Towards the benefit of the workers. You know, this is not about automation. Is it about clean energy or clean air? It's about, uh, limiting the power of the labor movement in America. And it's imperative, as.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We can see, as Mr. Wilson was councilman also was talking about his own experience as a McDonnell Douglas, which my uncle and great aunt worked, that it doesn't exist anymore now. Those are orchestrated attacks on the American worker by companies that don't have our best interests, um, in mind.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that saying, I think rather than having a recommendation to, uh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Conduct a study, we should have a recommendation to stand in solidarity with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What they're doing just across the board. What's going on? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. And before before I have Mr. Serrano speak, I'm going to call the next round of speakers our our community college trustee. President. Vivian Marlowe. Shannon Ross. Brandon Dowling. Joni Ricks. They can please line up as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, Toronto. Hello, Mayor. How you doing, Rex? How you doing, everybody else? Thank you very much, council members, for having this study. Al in there. There's Roberto. Janine, thank you all. And you know Susie Pierce. I like what you said.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What she said got in here. This is a national problem that's going to happen. This automation, it's not just I lw I had a sign out there 48% of jobs to be automated by 2040. It's not just the ILWU, it's everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there will be a revolution in this country. When you start losing that many jobs and people start to be homeless like crazy, you know, Rex came to I was talking to him the other day and he's working on like you're all working on automation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that. I mean, not automation on homelessness. And then the other thing you're talking about taking care of your people in Long Beach. Taking care of your workers. A couple of them. One of them is one tenant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, Long Beach is really done. Good. I can tell Long Beach cares about the port. They all know about the port. Other city councils don't know. We have a guy named Chris Garcia. Would you stand up real quick?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is an SSA, one of our top drivers, SSA driver. They do some moves between 30 and 50 moves an hour that'll beat a robot. But it isn't all about a robot. It's about keeping American jobs here, keeping people worked in America.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, it isn't all about getting this in that it's about taking care of your community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, David.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor. Council members and city staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While I am very proud to be president of our college board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not here in that capacity, nor as a commissioner. I'm here as a rank and filer of ILWU, Local 13, and I'm here with my family, my union sisters and brothers. I would like to thank Councilmember Richardson and the other council members who have joined him in bringing this agenda item forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to speak in favor of it. I would also like to thank EPIK and the outstanding focus group that came out to our Local 13 and spoke with some of our Long Beach Union members. This is an important issue and couple of key points just moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please take into consideration that near zero and zero emission cargo handling equipment technology has advanced with many options available that include human operation. Also, the Port of Long Beach today is recognized as a world class port. Let us not forget the significant contribution of the ILWU Longshore workforce, and I'd like to ask that all future automation projects'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at the port include job and economic impact reports and human operation. Please direct the port to be sensitive to that. Thank you once again. Thank you for including us. Thank you for giving us a seat at the table.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And most importantly, thank you for getting ahead of this issue. Thank you for being proactive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Trust.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name is Shannon Ross, council members and mayor. Sorry in reverse your efforts. I commend your efforts to be proactive on this issue of automation. Additional automation in the Port of Long Beach will definitely come with a cost, and that costs will be job loss, as we have already witnessed this at the Long Beach Container terminal'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Many families that live right here in Long Beach will be adversely affected, in turn affecting the local economy. Further, the December 2018 McKinlay, McKenzie and Company report, as reported in numerous trade journals such as the 2018 Journal of Commerce, found that terminals implementing automation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My apologies. Experienced a loss of productivity that only. And that any benefit were outweighed by the cost. At this time, I believe clean air is a must in the port, but also no clean air can be accomplished without automation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I urge you to vote on agenda item 17. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much as Ross Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members and staff and thank you for allowing us to present on this critical work related to automation at the Port of Long Beach. My name is Brandon Dowling and myself, and the subsequent two speakers are all members of the Inaugural Class of the Economic and Policy Impact Center's Leaders Institute, a six month'",
        "'speaker_2': 'program designed to empower and develop a network of diverse leaders to advance racial and economic equity and create positive social change in the Long Beach region. As part of our class graduation requirements, we must complete a community project focused on a policy area affecting the Greater Long Beach community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our group's project in support of this agenda item engaged ILWU Local 13 in July of this year to conduct a focus group with 12 full time longshore workers to gather their perspectives and opinions on the impact of automation on their own jobs at the port.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These longshore workers range in age from 35 to 53, with an average tenure of nearly 20 years on the job. And over the course of approximately an hour and a half, they were guided through, facilitated questions asked by our team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's our intention that every voice be heard as policy discussions around this issue continue in the coming months. And it's our sincere desire that future policy decisions will take into account those who'll be most impacted by the effects of these policies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll now turn over to the next speaker to talk a little bit about our findings. Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Dr. Johnny Riggs, O.D., and I'm part of the Epic Leaders Institute, as well as a proud resident of Long Beach. I had the distinct privilege of facilitating the focus group.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were a couple of moments in our discussion that particularly resonated with me, and I would like to highlight them tonight. When asked what they consider to be the best benefit about working for the Port of Long Beach, a longshore worker discussed that this job makes workers feel that they are impacting and giving back to the local'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community. And this statement served to be a common theme throughout our time together as the workers share. Time and time again, how much they value their community and how much their presence impacts Long Beach, both economically and socially.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When asked about the biggest concern regarding port automation, a long time worker brought up the fact that the port is publicly owned land and thus the decision to automate and its subsequent impacts should be taken to the local community since they technically own the land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It should not simply be the decision of port operators. That really caused me to pause because as a resident, I never really thought about this issue from that perspective. When asked about the best strategy for stopping job loss due to automation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A long show worker brought up the importance of encouraging operators to invest in technology that improve the efficiency and productivity of current workers. As a researcher and statistician, I know how much data matters. And with the talk of the importance of efficiency, I think what gets glossed over is whether or not automating every aspect of port operations'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is really in the best interest of Long Beach port operators and the Long Beach community. I think it's time to act. I'll end with saying I think it's time to investigate this issue from all sides. I encourage you to support it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And our last two speakers are Dr. Sally Saro and Elissa Ruth. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honorable Mayor Garcia, Councilmember and staff my name is Dr. Sally Sara and thank you to Councilmember Richardson and Councilmember Pearce and Vice Mayor Andrews as well as Councilmember Ranga for supporting this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was an honor to be part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the inaugural.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Class to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Help with the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Conduct, this study group.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it was a privilege to be able to speak to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The longshore workers, to hear from them. And I have a few items as far as their suggestions to include in the study, and that is to consider phasing in automation slowly over time with the input of those who will be impacted by the change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Identify and evaluate long, short jobs where a human worker is more efficient than a robot. And finally, which has brought us here, which is to push for an and economic impact report at the city level that also includes the community social impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I want to thank you all for supporting the item in advance and agenda item number 17. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. My name is Elizabeth and I am a longshoreman and also a small business owner here in the community. I want to thank you for considering being a buffer between the foreign companies that are coming and taking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Over and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having their own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Personal agenda, taking jobs from our workers. And it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really going to affect and it's going to impact in so many different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ways the economic impact and the environmental.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Impact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank you guys ahead of time for actually considering and backing this bill. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That concludes public comment. I'm going to make a few comments now. I think everyone else has had a chance to say some remarks. I want to just begin, obviously, by thanking the council members that brought this item forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is actually a critical discussion and as was noted by some members of the LW. It also goes beyond what's happening at the Port of Long Beach, the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Oakland, and certainly across across the country as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This this discussion is really about a broader discussion about what the future of work in this country and in this world actually looks like. And we are in danger as a nation, in grave danger as a nation of getting so far ahead with the way technology is automating all of our jobs that we could hit as a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'country, a major crisis when it becomes people's ability to actually find work, to put food on the table for their families. And that is just a reality. There has been there has been a lot of of academic work on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, if you ask, you know, the top economists and top folks across the country in our universities today, they will tell you that second to climate change, there is no greater challenge facing us right now as a as a world than what the future of work is going to look like for for people out there every'",
        "'speaker_1': 'single day in Long Beach. There is no more important industry than our port and goods movement. It provides the largest impact to our local economy. It is the larger, largest provider of good jobs and where and where. The future of work and automation certainly has impacts across industries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're seeing it in fast food restaurants. You're seeing it at in retailers, you're seeing it on the assembly line. One key difference and why I think the discussion about automation is critical at the port is you're actually talking about jobs that are high paid, have benefits can have attached to them are pensions and have you have the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ability to actually be able to take care and maintain of families on their own. And so these jobs are not just jobs. They are good paying jobs. You want to have to build a strong middle class in any city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I commend the forward thinking about the discussion, not just of automation, but hopefully once this study gets gets moved forward. I think this council and this is a good impetus for it. But it is it is past time that this body had broader discussions about what the future of work is going to look like over'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the next ten, 20 and 50 years in the city of Long Beach and across the country. And if we don't get ahead of what is happening, this economy could could suffer indefinitely. And that and that crisis level will affect real people with real jobs within our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just want to think I do believe that that the LW and though our dockworkers are actually leading this kind of this discussion across the country about what work is going to look like and what good benefited work should look like, represented work and what it should look like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want to thank all of you for doing that. I want to also add that as mayors in California, we're having serious conversations with the governor about how he can really pull together and lead on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think he is going to do so. It's critical that this is a discussion that not just happens in Long Beach, but not just in all of our ports on the port side, but also in the community as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so thank you all that had brought this forward. Thank you. And I look forward to supporting this. And with that, I want to go back to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Very well said, Mayor. I think I really want to applaud everyone that came out and spoke tonight, everybody that's been leading this this fight. And obviously, the gravity of this topic is serious, serious for you and your families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's serious for our port. We've invested millions and millions of dollars into infrastructure in our port. And it's important, as was mentioned by a speaker for our small businesses, because of how many of you spend your dollars. And we know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know from my work at Lane that every dollar of a living wage equals $3 back in our community. And so those good jobs really do matter. And so with that, you know, I'd like to make sure that the the study focuses on how we keep human operations at our terminals while also automating as much as possible'",
        "'speaker_4': ', but keeping those human operators there. And I'd like to ask Rex Councilmember Richardson about the conversation about having an independent study, because I know our port does have a lot on their hands right now. I know that this type of study is not something we we want to step in too lightly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so as I'm sitting here, I really think that it's important that we have that conversation around an independent study. So, Councilmember, I look forward to hearing your thoughts on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or is there anything else. The last one. Cute. I was going to touch on that. That it. Thank you, Councilwoman Pierce. I think a few things came out from this conversation that probably need to be highlighted. Three things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So one funded by property. So there were three council members who brought up and saw the fiscal impact, the intention funded by port. I think given we had, you know, folks and statisticians talking about the importance of data and academics, I think goes without saying it should be an academic report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then I think it also goes without saying that it should be it should be independent. Fair. Right. That's that's our expectation. So I know that the port is paying attention to every word we say right now. I want to raise those three words up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So funded by you, port independent and academic. I also want to I also just want to say, again, I think this is I think the mayor summed it up beautifully, really the larger conversation about the future work. But at the same time, we do have a responsibility to our citizens of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we've been talking, you know, having this discussion about inclusion and the fact that we can't be a world class city. We can't continue to talk about our economics unless we really have a focus on key performance indicators on how our people are doing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this should be a study that really tells us about how this is going to impact the people of Long Beach. You know, I know that there will be other studies. I know that the state will ultimately engage and all the counties engaged, but I don't think their focus will be Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My hope with having a local study that we're able to learn from the lens of our local community, the neighborhoods we care about, the schools we care about, the businesses we care about, what does the impact to us?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What our you know, what are the things we can do? What does this time I look like? And how do we begin as a community to really embrace and engage in this conversation to make sure that's the best outcome for the people of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's why we should do a local study. So thank you again. Thank you to everyone who came out. Thank you for. I'll just say this. I'm really proud of these EPI graduates last two weeks. That really brought some really incredible issues to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I look forward to, you know, what you guys take on in the future. Thanks a lot.'",

But I guess a lot of individuals really understand that when we talk about homeless and you think some of those individuals, you know, the jobs that we have, as I put the individuals from the port, it makes our city so much better'",
        "'speaker_8': 'because those individuals are put back into the city. If you think about automation, what it would do to a city of this magnitude, it would be incredible. So that's when I sit down and talk to some of the management and the board.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'up were male and female. And everyone have a chance to work at the port and those individuals have those jobs, what they've done for themselves and their families, it's incredible. So what are we talking about? Automation. I don't even.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to just one quick thing to add, because it's been mentioned a few times, I just want to make it. I think the council certainly aware. And just to be clear, also, the Port of Long Beach is not some faraway entity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Port of Long Beach is a department of the city of Long Beach. So the Port of Long Beach is the harbor department of the city of Long Beach, just like the Port of Los Angeles is not some faraway entity from Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the it's the department of the city. And so I think for for this body, like our water department or our civil service department or the many other departments that are that are governed through appointments made and affirmed by this council and myself, these these departments of the city are are critical to the work and the way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they impact our our community. And so it's very appropriate and important for us to to work with all of our city departments in coming up with solutions to these big challenges. And so I think that's that's important. And I know we're all going to move forward together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so with that, there's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, honorable mayor and members of the city council. As the city manager said, we're here to talk a little bit about Sunnyside Cemetery, which is located on Willow Street between California and Orange Avenue. This is one of the most historic sites in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It measures approximately 13 acres and was established in 1906. We say it's the second oldest burial ground in the city of Long Beach because the municipal cemetery was actually established in 1901. There are about 16,000 people buried in Sunnyside, including Union soldiers and several pioneer Long Beach figures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Over the past few years. As the cemetery filled up, the space to sell, new burial plots decreased. And so that put a lot of pressure on the cemetery to operate and continue to maintain its aging infrastructure. In June 13th of 2019, the Friends of Sunnyside Cemetery approached the city and indicated that they were unable to continue maintenance'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and that a permanent closure of the cemetery was imminent. Later that same month, we actually received formal notification from the board that they were requesting to work with the city to transfer the title of of the cemetery to the city of Long Beach, changed the status from a private cemetery to a public or municipal cemetery, and to'",

And so when we discussed this this proposal I'm sorry, we actually invited our our Parks Rec and Marine Department into the discussions because they currently operate a four acre municipal cemetery, which is contiguous to Sunnyside.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That four acre site has an operations budget of approximately $60,000 in the general fund budget. It's obviously much smaller than the 13 acre historic cemetery next door.

The initial assessment of staff based on the four acre site of the municipal cemeteries that the 13 acres, Sunnyside, would add approximately $230,000 of additional annual maintenance cost that is currently unbudgeted. Some of the other issues associated with the cemetery and its current status is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that the Council had a chance to review much of this presentation. If you can just kind of I know we have a long budget hearing, so maybe we can just kind of go through this a little quicker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You got it. All right. So one of the things that we want to make sure we do is we want to disclose to the city council and to the public that there are some outstanding liabilities, both one time and ongoing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also, the Sunnyside board has asked that we recognize some of the existing obligations, some of the events that they put on and some of the contracts they have with for for grants. They've also agreed to transfer all of those records that would become also the property of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So essentially we have done some due diligence, the boards current with all of their licenses, with the state, with all their reporting requirements. And we have been evaluating some potential funding sources that might be available to assist with both the one time and ongoing improvements at the cemetery.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So with that, the recommendation tonight from the city manager is to accept the transfer of the the property itself, as well as to accept the transfer of the funds in the the foundation's endowment and then allow for us to work with all the existing contracts that are currently on the site, either for burial or for events.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And with that, I'll conclude my report. I'm here with Steve Scott from the Parks Rec and Marine Department if there are any questions about operations of the cemetery. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Kyser. I'm going to make a couple opening comments. I'm a conservative councilmember. You're Ringo. I made the motion. I want to just say that the preservation of. Of the site of the cemetery is incredibly important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been incredibly important, certainly to me. It has been incredibly important to Councilmember Turanga, who has advocated for this for many, many years. And I just want to thank the staff for their hard work in getting us here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a couple important notes about this site. The first is that it's a historical site for us as a city. While it certainly is not in public hands currently. Many of our founding fathers and mothers of the city are buried there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's their last resting place. And so it's an. Credibly a significant location for for history and for the city as it looks back as it looks back to its founding. Beyond that, there are many residents and families who currently have members of their family buried at that site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And these are folks that I run into when I'm walking down the street that I might see at the grocery store that talk about their, you know, their mother or their grant or their grandparent or an uncle whose last resting place is there at Sunnyside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is also not just a historical place. It is a place that has deep connections, a deep emotional connections to many of the residents that live in our city. And so to to be able to acquire the site, bring it into our Long Beach Park system and to really create synergy with the rest of our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'park system is really, really special and really, really important. And so I think this is a very important decision. I think that the staff, Mr. Kaiser, you and your team have been working really hard on this. We've been talking about this for for a couple of years and how we do this the right way while being respectful'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to those that are doing the work currently. So it's been a back and forth, but we said from day one we would not let the cemetery close or fall into a major disrepair. And I'm really glad that we're meeting that that commitment and that promise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with that, I want to turn it over to counsel for your anger. This would not be possible without his full support. And I want to. He's made the motion. I'll turn this over to him.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I'm happy to support this and second, this motion. I have had the opportunity to be at Sunnyside Cemetery on many occasions. And I cannot support your your claim that there's a lot of history there. The Historical Society of Long Beach holds their annual cemetery tours there, and I have tried out my thespian chops there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I acted, played the role of many of our historic figures over the years on on a few occasions. And and I do understand the value and significance of that. And I've been reached out to by many of my constituents who have loved ones who are there, who are resting there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's only appropriate that we as a city take that on and support the legacies that that are actually there. As you said, Mayor, many of the the founding founding fathers and mothers of the city are arrested there.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Comes from a supernova.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm very happy to be able to support this item. I originally didn't think I could do that because my grandparents are buried at the cemetery. But I consulted with our city attorney and he said, because I don't want to speak for Mr. Park and he's right here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think basically that because I don't have a current financial interest in the cemetery, that there's no conflict of interest. He also asked me if I planned on being buried there. I don't own a plot. That decision could be made later.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just don't rush me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Andrews?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Counsel, I'm hearing it's very important because the fact that we do have a lot of history in that regard, and I'm so glad the transfer is being taken care of and I said is really going to do a big job in that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So congratulations to you doing, you know, bringing up this item to the DHS. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Also just case, remember, also noted. I know that the Historical Society obviously has done a lot of work on the site and did a lot of research. So I'm sure as we move forward will make sure that they're an active partner in restoration and in doing that work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we look forward to that partnership. I have public comment. I have five members of the public. Please come forward in this order. Roxann Palmer, Christine Rattan, Jeff Mallin, Michael Michael Minter and Cindy Canfield. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, Mayor and Council.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you, Daryl. You've been a supporter and lost and who stepped away, who is often performs was Eddie Cannon, a retired auditor for the city. So each year we tell the stories of the people buried in the cemetery.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over 23 years, we've told 200 stories to about 12,000 people. We know how much history is there. We've got a Japanese family whose son was in the regiment that liberated Dachau while his parents sat in an internment camp.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've got a family that ran a mexican restaurant for more than 60 years. We've got mayors, we've got city of port commissioners, water commissioners, all kinds of people. The diversity that is Long Beach, you can see in that cemetery, you can see the history.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can see the flu victims, the scarlet fever victims. Every a veteran of every war going back to the Civil War, it's all there. So we thank you very much for taking this on. We always say that every plot has a story, and it's certainly true at Sunnyside.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I myself was born here in Long Beach, and I grew up here. I have three generations of families buried at Sunnyside in 1945. My parents and their families came to Long Beach from the Manzanar Relocation Center in Independence, California.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They settled in Long Beach, and my father worked as a freelance gardener for this in the city of Long Beach for 25 years. In 1978, my father was hired by the city of Long Beach Parks and Recreation as their gardener.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He worked at many of the local cemeteries and he also worked at the municipal while he worked at many of the local parks. And he worked at the local municipal cemeteries. My 92 year old mother has a companion plot with my father, who had passed away in 2006.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so when it is her time, she is hoping that she would be able to be buried there with him. And we just wish and thank you very much for looking at this for us. Thank you very much.'",

And I'm a lifelong resident of the ninth district. The census is something that we know is very important, but often gets overlooked as a process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lots of times people get left out and there's no way for folks to be included when it comes to filling these things out. Folks don't know that you can do this online or call it in, and some people stated that they don't even get the little paper in the mail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to get an accurate count and truly represent the population of Long Beach, we need to we need people out there doing the work and collecting these surveys from the underrepresented. But the point is the point isn't just to go out and collect the survey, but to truly inform the community about why this is so important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When people are left out, we don't get the resources we need. The best way to go and collect these is to have local community based organizations, because we know the best about how to reach out to these communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And folks, as I talk to neighbors and community members. So yeah, and it's imperative that we get this right for the outcomes of the 2020 census. It'll have lasting effects on our city and especially young people like myself who inherit the outcomes of the count.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's why we're asking to allocate $500,000 and a one time fund to have community organizations educate and conduct outreach to the community. Thank you.'",

And as a recent Mills Act recipient for my home, for my home that I bought recently and went through a very intense process with development services, I became aware of the city ordinances in general plan elements that protect the our properties'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So the BLOCK Park Historic Ordinance specifies that the entire neighborhood is a designated landmark, not just specific buildings.

        "'speaker_1': 'For example, the clean team responded over 21,000 illegally dumped items. Well, this number is still too high. We are seeing a positive change through collaboration with Harvard Kennedy School and the city's innovation team. Public Works has increased its services for collection of large items, and the community has responded this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was an 18% increase in folks asking for items to be picked up, thus reducing them just being dumped on the corner or in the alleys. So still a lot of work to do, but we are making progress.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So we we believe and we put out the gantlet for others to try to achieve their success. So livability will allow me to strength is that our community loves being outside, enjoying parks, beaches and dining to make it easier to get around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city continues to invest in the expansion of its bicycle network. This year we celebrated one of our newest and longest bike routes, the Daisy Myrtle Bike Boulevard, taking you from uptown to downtown. This nine and a half mile bike way runs through districts one, six, seven, eight and nine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you haven't taken a ride on it yet, I highly recommend that you do. It's a great way to see our city. The next bike way to be completed will connect central Long Beach to Cal State via 15th Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's our 15th street bike boulevard, so go beach. There is also a new important connection through Belmont Shore. Getting us getting bicyclists all the way to the L.A. or excuse me, the San Gabriel River. This is an important connection for that highly traveled bicycle path with 160 miles of bike ways, the community has responded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We added a new echo totem this year at Promenade and Broadway, similar to the one that we have down at the Belmont Pier. And those totems are on pace to record over 1.6 million pedestrians and bicyclists enjoying being outside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also want to highlight sustainability. Our efforts continue to grow with an 8% increase in the amount of waste diverted through recycling efforts. So we've increased recycling. Also, phase three of the expanded polystyrene ordinance or EPS ban goes into effect in December, and that will bring into compliance our small our smaller restaurants, 100 seats or less.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even though it's still months away. We are seeing compliance from many of those restaurants. So we appreciate the hard work of the team and the work of the restaurants and really the citizens who are pushing sustainability efforts citywide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what does the public works budget look like? It's really split 5050 between operating and CHP. It's roughly $245 million. And I want to focus on operating first. Which, as you can see in this slide, kind of breaks down the different funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in FY 20, the operating budget is 127, $127 million. The different funding sources include the General Fund. Public Works represents about 7% of the city's general fund, supporting 244 hardworking men and women providing city services like street sweeping parking enforcement, traffic operations, permit review and street maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Notable changes, Public Works is constantly striving to deliver more efficient services to Long Beach. We're proposing new positions to support street medians. You will call that is a directive that came from this council to transition medians from Parks and Rec to public works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city has over 220 acres of medians, median islands and backlots, and that's equal to about 166 football fields. So these positions are key to help deliver a cleaner city. Public Works has also released a new development guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This book is to help our customers navigate the permit process. We have also reorganized the operation to deliver faster service and I really think the team for their efforts to try to make that process easier. Last thing we're doing is looking at technology and like development services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're implementing a permit filing to help implement a faster process and like to also highlight the passage of a measure w with that funding. Long Beach should receive over $5 million annually for stormwater capture and reuse projects. With this funding I anticipate we will break ground of LBE must this next year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a facility cleaner. Our water going into the L.A. River. It's an exciting project and I look forward to getting it built. Also to help reduce some costs. The General Fund Public Works has been able to shift its staff for stormwater from general fund to measure W funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This will save almost $800,000 annually. Lastly, we will be bringing forward in the next fiscal year the adoption of our state streets. Long Beach Vision Zero plan. This will seek to eliminate serious injuries and fatalities in our transportation system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward to making that presentation to council and gaining broader community support as we move forward with a Safe Streets Long Beach program. So what are our challenges and opportunities? One of the opportunities we have is our zero waste plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So not vision zero, but zero waste. We will be bringing that forward to this council soon. We're currently in the process of conducting a waste character characterization study, and that's not easy for me to say. This will allow us a better understanding of what waste is actually going into is being thrown away, and so from that will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be able to understand better what can then be diverted. So we're working on that and we look forward to bringing that to council in the community for adoption. We're also implementing a pilot program for automated license plate reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This will help our parking enforcement staff be more efficient. It also allows us to electronically chalk, if you will, tires to enforce time, limited parking areas and assist in the recovery of stolen vehicles. So so far, that's in a pilot mode.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we look forward to finalizing that and bringing something forward to council to give us new tools moving forward. So what's one of our challenges? Well, one of the big challenges we have in our department is a competitive job market.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's significantly impacting the retention and recruitment of qualified staff. Currently, public works has approximately 100 vacant positions or 20% of our workforce. So I look forward to working with Christina, our new civil service director, to help close this gap.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm confident that we can come up with a program to help hire staff and help fill those vacancies. So that concludes my operating budget discussion and now I want to shift into a.S.A.P. So this investment in infrastructure continues to be a priority for staff and for this Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that as I meet with different council districts, there's always lots of questions about where are we in different infrastructure projects and how are we moving infrastructure forward? It's always good to talk about some of the prior some of the projects that have been accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you see some pictures here. New sign at the airport, Bay Shore lifeguard station. A new curb ramps, a storm drain line on Seaside Way, a new playground at Drake Park and our soon to be completed New Haven Park Community Center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So shifting to the Skippy side of the public work budgets, there's roughly $118 million that is being, excuse me, committed to infrastructure improvements. And we've done a revamping of the copy book and there are six different categories within the IP book.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're trying to show three or four snapshots of the community gets an understanding of what is that three year investment plan. And so if you went to any one of these different categories, you would see the details of the various projects that would that are planned for implementation under under these categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first, I want to highlight mobility. The city takes a complete street streets approach. And so what does that mean? It means that we don't just redo a street. We also look to see if it needs to add ADA curb ramps, if we need to fix broken sidewalks, if curb and gutters need to be replaced, if the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'trees need to be trimmed. So or if the street is part of the bicycle masterplan and we need to add a bicycle facility. So that's all a part of what we look at whenever we redo a street. And this is an example of third street in downtown what which we call our cycle track project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in this example, we've added updated bus lanes, updated separated bike lanes, and it's really a key connection for all folks riding in and out of the downtown area. So this year, 13.6 miles of bicycle lanes were added for all residents, ages 8 to 80.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what we strive for. It's not for the club riders, but mainly for folks trying to use it as transportation or for exercise. And it really enhances the city city's livability efforts when we provide alternatives to single occupancy vehicle trips.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mobility has a number of different funding sources. You see them listed here and then you see how we plan to utilize those resources moving forward. So under our major streets, we have two different street categories majors and and residential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So our major streets, we plan on improvements in fiscal year 22 Market Anaheim, which is a pedestrian safety corridor project, and we will start working on getting the design updated for Artesia, which is a Great Streets project, and that's being coordinated through Skegg.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're looking forward to those major projects coming forward. We're also planning to finish paving all the dirt alleys because council made a commitment in measuring to two paved dirt alleys so that funding is identified, which will accomplish the last of about roughly 1.6 miles of alleys to be paved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we have $7 million that will be going towards sidewalks and addressing our ADA ramps in our path of travel. All right. So this slide hopefully looks familiar. This is essentially our five year street plan. We're well into this plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I wanted to highlight just I know you can't really see all the details of all the streets in this plan, but you can see that on our Web page. But this really shows all the green, the green, our completed streets and really highlights the level of activity that's been occurring in the city since the passage of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'measure. This is just 17 to 19. So in two and a half to three years, we've been able to achieve a lot of work in our in our citywide streets system. We do work to try to do at least a two year paving program that gives us a year to design the streets, in a year to deliver'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the streets. This shows the one that was provided last year for the 19 and 20 streets. We're working now to update a new program which will show that fiscal year 20 and 21 streets. So shifting now to public facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We plan to invest about $11 million to further our our public facilities. You can see the sources of those fundings on the table to the left. And what where is that money going to go? So the council is looking to make strategic investments, and we are working to finalize a facility condition assessment, which is looking at our'",
        "'speaker_1': 'libraries, parks and other city owned facilities. And that money will go to address some of the most needed issues in those in those facilities. Once I have the FCA completed, I'll be able to return to this Council and highlight what facilities will be targeted with those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The police academy design will be completed and we'll be building that project in fiscal year 20 and hope to start construction towards the end of FY 20. We're also looking at energy efficiency improvements at our armory building. So under the category of Parks and Recreation, we're looking at continuing our efforts to complete some enhancement in Hampton Park'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We're also looking to expand our Drake Chavez greenbelt or interconnecting those two parks and then putting some money towards those areas. Wetlands restoration. Quickly, beaches and marinas. There's a commitment of $2 million there that will help with the Colorado Lagoon Playground, Naples Seawall Maintenance and Alamitos Bay improvements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our airport has projects planned for the terminal and rehabilitation of the airfield runways. And lastly, utilities is focusing on upgrades to our stormwater pump stations and our capture and reuse projects like Long Beach, much like, as I mentioned earlier, and then important water and sewer pipelines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So before I conclude measure, I before I conclude the SIP presentation, I think it's important to talk about measuring because without measure, a many of these things that we're talking about this evening we wouldn't be talking about. Measure has been a significant influence in how we address our citywide infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And first, I want to point to this map. If you haven't been to the cities, measure a Web page. Please go there. It's a fantastic interactive map. The team has done a tremendous job really putting information out about measuring projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just some projects. Quickly, I want to scroll scroll through some pictures of what measure has helped fund Bixby Park Community Center, roadway improvements via Carmelita as West Police Station Improvements, Accessibility at City Place, Garage and Harvey Milk Park Silverado Field Improvements Main Health Facility Lobby Improvements More Curb Ramps Citywide Veteran's Park Playground New Roof at Fire'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Station ten Eldorado Park Restroom Repairs, Redondo Avenue Improvements and our Smart Streetlight Network. So those are just a few highlights of our measure funds. So what are we looking at for fiscal year 20? It's another $19 million, a measure that's looking to be invested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with the 19 million planned for FY 20, which is going to support alley improvements, Low Street is wetlands, Drake Chavez, Greenbelt and Police Academy design, as I mentioned before, with all of that investment. Next slide, we're looking at a $107 million through fiscal year 20.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you recall, when we went out to the community and started talking about the infrastructure plan, it was roughly $100 million a measure investment. We will have already exceeded that with this year's allocation. And then looking forward into the next three fiscal years, it's anticipated another $45 million will be allocated towards infrastructure, bringing the total through'",
        "'speaker_1': 'FY 23 to over 150 $153 million of investment from Measure A. So just lastly, where are our challenges and opportunities relative to CHP in fiscal year 20? We continue to strive to create plans for making strategic investment of our infrastructure dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll be updating our payment management plan. So in 2020 will have new data to see where we're at from a citywide PCI assessment. We recently completed a sidewalk, what some call a self-assessment are really looking at where are we have missing curb ramps, where do we have out of compliance curb ramps, where do we have uplifted sidewalks'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and how do we then plan to address those? So that sidewalk assessment was recently done. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of finalizing our facility condition assessment. That should be something we will update every ten years along with the sidewalk plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A pump station master plan was last done in 2015. So that would be another ten year plan that we would update regularly. And so the one that we're really weak in, that we're looking for a different measure, w opportunities is our stormwater master plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The last update we had was in 2005 and it was really an incomplete report. That was roughly the time when the stormwater program was transferred from water to the city. And so we still need to get a really good understanding of where we have challenges within our stormwater conveyance system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's one of the reasons that we're working to find and seek grants, opportunities to address stormwater. I mentioned Seaside earlier. That was a federal grant. We're also working or were are pleased to announce that the Federal Economic Development Administration, EDA, has awarded Long Beach about $8 million for to address flooding in different business corridors in the city'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So we're really looking forward to getting that money in and fixing a couple of things. Just lastly, I appreciate the Council's continued support for investing in the city's infrastructure. There is a great need, as and as indicated by these recent assessments listed here, but we are making progress.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I look forward to working on delivering these important projects illustrated here tonight, and I'm available to answer any questions. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much, Mr.. Mr.. Beck. I'm going to hear Development Services and Health next, and then we'll come back and do all the questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So one, development services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. I'm really pleased to present this year's budget for the Development Services Department. I'd like to take a moment to just acknowledge and thank our Administrative and Financial Services Bureau manager, Lisa Falls, who played a key role in the preparation of our budget this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'll start by talking about the core services that are. Can I get the. The clicker. No, you're fine. Okay. You're fine. So we'll go ahead and get started. I'd like to talk about the core services that the Development Services Department provides.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our mission is fundamentally to shape the city's physical environment and improve the quality of life for the city's residents, visitors and our daily work force. And I'll talk briefly about the role that each department plays in that effort in the planning and each bureau.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the Planning Bureau, we really shape the built environment through the general plan land use policies that are adopted by council and the use of the zoning code regulations to implement those policies. We review all proposed new development projects to ensure that they are in conformance with not only the general plan but also the zoning code objectives'",
        "'speaker_3': '. The Building Safety Bureau maintains and updates our local building standards to ensure that new buildings are properly designed and constructed. Our Plan Check Engineers Review Development Project plans to confirm that the construction meets current codes as well as during the construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The inspectors ensure that all structures are being built according to the approved plans. Our Code Enforcement Bureau ensures that buildings and properties are maintained and that communities are free from blight. We're in the second year of implementing a program that monitors vacant lots to ensure that they're there, properly maintained, and that they don't become an eyesore in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the community. Our Housing Bureau works with the developers to provide affordable housing, and our neighborhood services team provides routinely interfaces with the community and with developers to enhance the quality of life. These efforts include their work with neighborhood groups on physical improvements in their neighborhoods, as well as implementing a residential and commercial facade improvement program, as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as coordinating neighborhood cleanups and neighborhood tree planning events. These all work to enhance neighborhood esthetics as well as to build a sense of community. Lastly, we work to ensure that the city's significant historic buildings, architectural resources and neighborhoods are preserved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'll talk a little bit about some of our accomplishments as it relates to preserving the city's heritage. We've made great strides this year in preserving the city's historic resources. The Planning Bureau, working with the Cultural Heritage Commission, had a number of significant accomplishments this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We approved 21 mills that contracts to rehabilitate landmark properties. We won an American Planning Association award for the Design Guidelines for 16 historic districts in the city, and the Grant neighborhood in North Long Beach became the first historic district that has been established in the city in the last ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And lastly, per the mayor's request in his budget that our department is assisting the funding of the Long Beach Historical Society's efforts to digitize the the Long Beach Press Telegram archives. So our staff looking at how we actually do shape this physical environment and shaping current development activity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our staff has been working harder than ever. I think anybody who's been driving around the city can see a substantial amount of new construction underway. This slide highlights a few of the recently completed or soon to be completed projects such as our new Civic Center and City Hall, important administration building, new apartments in the downtown, and two'",
        "'speaker_3': 'new single family subdivisions that have been built in the city, as well as new projects in the Douglas Park area, the Long Beach Exchange and the terminal. During this fiscal year or this previous fiscal year, the building safety staff completed nearly 6100 plan reviews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is an increase of 25% more than they completed last year and the number of commercial and residential inspections that our inspectors in the field. That number increased even more dramatically. It increased by 75% over last year's inspection levels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our department is also protecting existing residents through code enforcement and rental housing inspection. Code enforcement staff investigated approximately 14,000 cases. They inspected nearly 11,000 over 11,000 homes and reported 133 potential garage conversions. And they registered 630 properties in the foreclosure registry and an additional 215 properties in the vacant lot registry program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we also draft at the recently a city council adopted tenant assistance program policies. And in terms of looking towards the future, I'd just like to highlight some of our accomplishments during this past fiscal year. We mentioned the land use policies that lay the groundwork for building our future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This year we completed three significant policy documents, and those will soon be coming to the City Council for Adoption. The first is the general plan noise element, one of our mandated general plan elements. We completed a draft Climate Action and adaptation plan and also a Globemaster Quarter specific plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This plan will facilitate an innovative repurposing of the former Boeing C-17 site, as well as stimulate reinvestment along the charity Cherry Boulevard Corridor. We also entered into agreements with four affordable housing developers on a project on projects that will provide a total of 190 new affordable homes for some of the city's most vulnerable, vulnerable populations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vista Del Puerto Apartments are a for 47 affordable homes for families and households with special needs. That project is in coordination with Clifford Beers. The second project, The Spark at Midtown, provides 97 affordable homes for families and households who are homeless or at the risk of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're building that project in coordination with link housing. We partnered with Habitat for Humanity for a project at 116 West 14th Street for ten for sale townhomes for low and moderate income first time homebuyers. And lastly, for 69, West Apartments provides 39 affordable homes for households who have experienced homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That project, we're also partnering with link housing. We launched an updated the city's website and we're really proud of the fact that this new website update has a mapping tool that allows the public staff, city council members and anyone who's interested to track the status of our major new development projects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So here for a brief snapshot of our budget, the development services. Our department's budget really relies on a mix of funding sources, including fees for services, former tax increment and also a number of different grant sources. But I'd like to note that most of our services that we provide in the department are covered by fees, and only'",
        "'speaker_3': '7% of our budget is from the city's general fund. And this year in our budget we're adding to new FTE fees. So I'd like to briefly talk about some of the notable changes in the budget that are being that is being proposed for this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I talked about the two new FTE fees that are being added. Those are to implement a program that was directed by council to implement the short term rental ordinance. And these two positions include an administrative analyst and a combination building inspector.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They both of these sessions will be needed to to manage the program as well as to enforce compliance with the ordinance that council. We hope to be bringing to council later this year. We're also going to be using a third party consultant to provide registration data interface as well as to man that 24 hour hotline to respond'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to immediate issues that occur in the residence. And they will also validate the data for the registrants. So I'd like to just talk a little bit about some of the challenges and opportunities in our department, and I'd just like to highlight a couple of those, both in planning, engineering and our inspection staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are experiencing, like the public works department, we're experiencing a lot of turnover and it's generally do from retirement but some from attrition. And we continue to experience that, that level of vacancies at about a 19% rate, so just shy of 20%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And essentially we have to do with either hiring temporary or contract staff to to backfill positions to continue providing an appropriate level of service. We also have challenges with our technological capabilities. As you probably know, we're assessing the are in for a data tracking system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the objective of that effort is to optimize how the system functions for us as a tool for tracking, monitoring and reporting our key workflow dynamic to make our our service delivery more efficient. And lastly, on one of the key efforts that we have been undertaken this year is our outreach, community engagement and outreach efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our community we have implemented this year for the first time community education workshops. We have a much more robust reporting of the department's agendas for project reviews, and those are now being made available to the public in a much more transparent manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we also have a we continue with our very robust community outreach activities, and we're promoting those very highly on the city's new website. So those we will continue to be working on each of these challenges. And that concludes our presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd like I'm available to answer any questions at the conclusion of all of the budget presentations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anex health.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening. Good evening. Honorable mayor, vice mayor and city council members. Thank you for this opportunity to share the Department of Health and Human Services for a 20 budget. We've had a busy and exciting year and we have significant opportunities on the horizon.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'First, I do think my team members who make all of what I share with you possible. I appreciate them fully and know the Health Department would not be where it is today without them. Of course, services. The Health Department offers over 40 public facing programs serving the life span from prenatal to end of life.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We work in and for every community in our city to protect the public's health, promote healthy living. We prevent and control communicable and vector borne diseases. We're currently building systems to improve access to early childhood and older adult services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We house people and we enhance opportunities, policies and systems to address health and social inequities in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Miss Cisco. Can the audience not hear?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You're not here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Everyone here. La la, la, la. Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You told me I didn't have to. How you can hear there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So. So while public safety generally focuses on police and fire. The Health Department is a vital component of the public safety continuum. In Long Beach. We plan daily to ensure the city is prepared for large scale public health emergencies and partner closely with the police and fire departments at large scale events such as the Grand'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Prix and Pride Parade, we coordinate emergency shelter, response and services and lead bioterrorism efforts for the city and the region. Our environmental health team coordinates city response to hazardous waste threats and ensures our restaurants and waters are safe.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We lead violence prevention efforts through safe Long Beach, and we immunize against public health threats. Just think, without the Health Department, mosquitoes would have taken over Long Beach and many more of us could have West Nile virus. Measles would be more prevalent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No one would know if it was safe to swim in our waters and our beaches would be so lonely. More people would have foodborne illness and we'd lose a lot of tourists and just think we could have a release of anthrax at a large scale event?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No. Wouldn't know what it was, nor could they adequately respond. It would be crazy to think about a city without a health department. Our accomplishments this year reflect the wide variety of programs in our department. We launch the All Children Thrive, which focuses on shifting policy and systems and developing new mechanisms for funding health and other services'",
        "'speaker_11': 'for children and families. We are highlighted as a best practice across the state. We were recently awarded our second round of funding for this effort. We've implemented an age friendly task force which is striving to strengthen the system of services and connection in the city through the Health Department relationships at the county level, the justice lab now'",
        "'speaker_11': 'has direct access to service systems for people that are being assessed by the mental health clinician in the jail. We are currently the only city in Los Angeles County with this direct access to resources. We continue to contribute to the fitness and safety of bikers in Long Beach, giving out over 500 helmets and educating a thousand people'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on bike safety. The Language Access Program continues to increase access to services and community involvement. We've had a 37% increase in the number of documents translated and a 91% increase in interpretation. Requests for community meetings relaunch the Justice Fund, which provides legal representation for immigrants facing deportation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we continue to strengthen the equity lens in the city by training 500 staff and community partners to ensure planning efforts, the capacity and outcomes in communities that have previously had limited opportunity. In terms of communicable diseases. We launched the the HIV NSD strategy in partnership with our comprehensive HIV planning group.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The mayor has proposed $250,000 per year for the next two years to support work to achieve these strategies to support reduction in new HIV infections. We currently operate a prep center for Excellence. We've tested over 900 people for HIV.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've also conducted 800 syphilis contact investigations in the last year. We responded to more than 3300 disease reports diseases such as salmonella, pertussis, typhus and West Nile virus. This has all been done with a team of four, four people.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the team is small, but it's mighty. We met the citywide effort for the regional measles outbreak. New measles suspect cases come in regularly and the team investigates each one. One measles case can include follow up for over 100 people.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We pull in staff from across the department and they work around the clock. And finally, our vector control responded to over 600 requests for mosquito abatement in the city in addition to our normal services. I must say, we're very excited about our new and welcoming ADA compliant lobby that was funded through Measure A is absolutely beautiful and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I welcome you all to come out and visit. In terms of homelessness, our accomplishments continue in homeless services and the housing authority. With our partnerships with other state departments and nonprofit providers. We've permanently housed over 1100 people this year, and the point in time count showed an 8% decrease in those who are chronically homeless.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We secured $27 million in grant funds this year, which has allowed us to continue to operate our ongoing services while also allowing us to purchase the navigation center in your homeless shelter site, provide more prevention services and rapid rehousing, as well as move toward implementation of services for Youth Safe Parking and the jobs program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Housing Authority implemented the homeless incentive program for landlords, provided over 7200 housing vouchers 712, or which for homeless veterans. The Housing Authority also committed 121 project based vouchers for ongoing support of low income and homeless housing in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our budget this year was our budget. Last year was just over $133 million. This year it is just over 152 million. This is due to increased homeless and housing authority funding. The funding for public health specific programing remains essentially flat.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The department receives approximately one third of a percent of the general fund acting to take after taking into consideration overhead costs. This represents a little bit less than 1% of our department revenues. We have 427 budgeted full time positions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The notable changes in the general fund include moving the language access program manager position from a three quarter time to full time position and an additional $25,000 for utilities for the Homeless Navigation Center. One time funds include $80,000 for the Language Access Program Services and 255,000 to support the Proactive Homeless Initiative and rapid response.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Within the Health Fund, we are upgrading and hiring new environmental health specialists that will be serving in the food program. And finally, ASAP funding will support a public affairs officer, the first we've had in the Health Department to support developing strategic messaging and education campaigns for issues such as homelessness and HIV, STD prevention, effectively communicate public health'",
        "'speaker_11': 'messaging and highlight the many amazing programs and services offered by the Health Department. Other things continue to go well for the department, we do face some challenges the increasing HIV and STD rates, as well as increased presence of other communicable diseases and the many international communicable diseases that will not stop at the border are putting intense pressure'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on our team. Our Response Team Health Department is the only to provide TB provider in the city of Long Beach. TB is very difficult to treat as people have to be seen every day. We are currently at 40% of staffing capacity and this is very concerning given the highly transmissible nature of the disease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The competition for medical staff, including nurses and doctors as well as laboratory staff, is intense. Our salaries cannot compete, placing pressure on our existing staff to try and meet the growing needs of the clinics. The older adult population continues to grow, become more diverse and have fewer resources.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yet our service system for older adults is essentially unfunded for particularly for those who cannot get to senior centers. The mental health and substance use prevention and treatment system is insufficient to meet the needs of the city. In addition, the homeless prevention funding does not nearly match the number of people who are at risk of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, we are completely remodeling the north facility and we're very excited about this opportunity. The remaining facilities are aging and need significant physical and technological upgrades. Funding for the Health and Human Services programing is becoming more difficult to access.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The competition is steeper than at the national and state level. To add to this difficulty for the competing for the grants, we have had insufficient administrative resources to manage the hiring process for all the new grant funded positions and to ensure that we draw down all those last dollars.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The team is amazing, amazing and fully committed. There just aren't enough of them. Unfortunately, this leads hard earned money, hard earned grant money on the table because we cannot fully draw it down and we really hate leaving money on the table.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And finally, in the past, the health department was financially in a place that it could not meet payroll, given difficult times. We work every year to ensure that we build the reserve needed. So this does not happen in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In a grant environment, this is very difficult. But through strong fiscal discipline, we are making progress. Our opportunities are endless, but there are just a few that I'll share with you here. We received a second round of funding for our catchy and Our Children Thrive initiative, which allows us to continue designing a coordinated system for young children'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and their families across the city. We just completed the community health needs assessment process for the department for the city and have nearly completed our own strategic plan for the next five years, which lays out our goals and strategies for a robust organization and community health improvement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Youth Vote Strategic Plan for youth and emerging adults is underway. This plan will outline goals and strategies to ensure youth success across our city. While currently unfunded, we continue to lead the Long Beach Age friendly initiative, which builds off the earlier older adult strategic plan and works to design services and connection systems to support older adults'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Our trauma and resiliency informed city efforts are moving forward. Both the Health Department and Library Services will serve as pilots for this program. The Justice Lab, in partnership with the police department, is growing, and we see real opportunity in the city to connect people to services they need instead of their returning to the streets.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This provides increased wellness opportunity for the people involved, as well as a crime prevention strategy for the Long Beach communities. We'll open a fully remodeled center for families and youth in Heaton Park next year, which will work on strengthening families and violence prevention.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've also added two clinical rooms to provide much needed HIV testing and treatment and other clinical services in North Long Beach. The Navigation Center year round shelter will greatly strengthen services for people experiencing homelessness and change the face of access to services to our city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'State funding will bring an additional 9 to $10 million to strengthen prevention and housing retention services with a focus on older adults and transition age youth. We're moving forward with technology opportunities that we're very excited about. The first is a common intake and referral system for the health department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our goal here is that data are collected only once for each person who walks into our system and people are connected to those services they need. This will improve customer service and outcomes. We're also working with UCD to improve data access and integration among city and community partners for homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's an improve our view to the cost of services, the ability to prioritize service improvements across the city, to enhance efficiencies for future cost savings to the city. Your Health and Human Services Department is present, is proud to stand for the health and wellness of Long Beach communities and individuals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We continue to seek funding, innovation, partnerships and community voice to build opportunity across this great city. We truly appreciate your support over the past year and we look forward to our continued work with you to move many opportunities forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And with that, I conclude my presentation. I'm open for questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you. This is our receive and file presentation. If I can get a motion in a second to receive and follow the presentation. Thank you. Before I go to Councilman Pearce, I'm going to make a couple couple questions and comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to just first start by just saying how impressive our public works budget is and it just continues to to grow and to really focus on doing quality projects expeditiously and certainly putting those measure dollars to work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's always a good opportunity to check in and just just remind ourselves how, how significant that investment by the community has been to our public infrastructure. It's hard to measure. I was I was having a conversation, you know, with some of your team members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that what I love about the the public works team, especially the team that we've assembled, that you've assembled, Mr. Beck, is they are they're really thoughtful about what the future of city building is and where cities are going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they're really constructing and rebuilding kind of streets and communities in that direction with that with the forward looking lens. So I just want to commend you for that. And I wanted to add that you and I had had a conversation and I know we don't have you looking into the exact number in here, but I think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it's it's your estimation that. In APR could be could be around 15 years or so. And I know you're still going to look at the exact number, but it could be that in about 15 years, thanks to both Measure Rea and our regular CIP work, we could we the potential to repave every street in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct. Yes, Mayor. I think if you look at our our current investment and if we are able to continue that current investment, I do believe that that's very accurate, that we would move from probably poor to fair level streets throughout the city to very good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's really significant because it shows a direct investment that when you put those extra dollars there, there's an opportunity for us over the next, you know, ten, 15, 20 years to really rebuild the entire city when it comes to a street infrastructure point of view.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's really substantial and something I'm excited about. You mentioned pieces. I don't I just want to make sure I mention this is for for the public sake as well. There there's a report or a story today, I think I read in online about our PCI numbers and the data that was pulled on PCI.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just as a note, I think the PCI data that was pulled was from 2014. So I just give a cautionary note. I've had a lot of friends text me there. There's PCI numbers which are which is great. I'm glad they're looking at our other open data portal, but those are PCI numbers that I think are from 2014'",
        "'speaker_1': '. It's not before measure investments. And so a lot of those numbers are not up to date. And I think we are working on putting up the latest data so that people have the correct information. Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just to add to that, so that that data comes out of the city's pavement management plan, so that's part of the results of the pavement management plan. We are in the process of conducting an update. So the most current data we have is from 2017.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I do anticipate once we have the 2020 data, that will be even in better shape than we were between 14 and 17. Okay, great. And obviously, I know that some of these numbers that we're giving and the years were we're doing some guesstimate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we'll have better we'll have a real better idea of of what the total years for a complete repave and where the PCI goes. As we do more work ahead. So thank you for that. And but I also want to just a note and again, to to both our other departments, thank you for the great work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's some really important programing and work that is happening. I do want to just note, just in the Health Department budget, when we called this out as well to remind the council what we don't often talk about it because it's not maybe it may not be top of mind all the time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't we can't forget that Long Beach. Is in the unfortunate position of having one of the highest HIV infection rates in the state between us and San Francisco and West Hollywood. I mean, we've discussed this. This is a we're at a a health crisis level four four in this area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have to take aggressive action and support, not just prep, pap and all the other really life saving drugs and choices that there are for four members, four members of our community, but also to aggressively try to reverse and bring down these high rates by working with the community and just doing a lot more testing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think I want to thank the particularly the HIV Comprehensive Study Group that has put forward some significant recommendations to help us with this work and many members of the LGBTQ community who consider this for them, if not the top issue, one of the top issues that we should be focused on as a city, because'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it certainly also is is an issue that directly affects that community and particularly gay men. And so I just want to make sure that we uplift that. And I want to thank you all for the work there. And with that, Councilman Austin, do you have any comments?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a few. Seems like I've been here all day long, and this air blowing underneath is not helping. But thank you to all of the departments for your presentations. I want to just just have a couple of questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One for our public works director. And, you know, everything is planned out and that's what the budget is for. But my question is, is there room and flexibility in your department's budget for unplanned infrastructure needs, such as, you know, serious facility repairs that come up?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the course of every day. Operations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So Councilmember Austin, the short answer is yes. We tried to allocate some funding for emergency repairs. I believe the budget proposed for FY 20 is $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So can we build a new fire station for $1,000,000?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, unfortunately, no. Significantly more to build a new fire station. But as an example, and I've used this example before, but I think it really does illustrate some of the challenges that we have at times. We had a water leak at the Stearns Community Center, and that water leak brought water into the electrical panel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we tried to address that and uncover the challenges and peeled back the roof, the entire roof structure was completely disintegrated from a lack of maintenance. And we ultimately had to cut the entire roof off that building and build up the new roofing structures before we could put a roof back on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What would normally be a simple reroof project turned into a hole what we called a roof academy, and cost the city over $1,000,000. So that one project alone eight well into and beyond the emergency funds that we had available for facility work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would say that we're probably going to be facing the same type of problem with the fire station nine situation, which obviously was not planned or foreseen. Otherwise, it would be listed in this 520 budget. But I think because of the serious nature of that, that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Unforeseen issue with the the mold in that fire station. That's going to be an issue that I'd like to see moved to a priority list. And I've already had the conversations with the city manager as well as fire chief to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, again, it's good to know that there are some contingency funds here. Obviously not going to be enough. So the other pieces is mobility. We've talked a lot about that. We've made a lot of great progress in the city with Measure A and other funding streams.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you talk about how your department leverages the the other measures other other measures from from the county MTA like measure R, measure M SB one funding to to and where those funds are going toward to overall master plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We I know we get to put a lot of emphasis on measure a I'm sorry. Yeah. Imagery.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So I think it's a really good question. And just as reference, if we went back three years, which is before Measure A, it's before the extension of L.A. County Measure M and before SB one gas tax, we were able to make an investment of roughly $16 million into our city streets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today, our investment is more than double that. We're at about $33 million. So we're able to make significant strides in addressing our deteriorated roadways citywide. And you have to remember, and that's one of the reasons I try to illustrate are our Complete Streets approach, that we're not just doing paving, we're adding in those ADA ramps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whenever we touch the street, we're adding in and fixing those sidewalks that are damaged and fixing the curbs and gutters that are damaged. So I know at times there's there's concern about the cost of the street, but you have to understand that it's a full package.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we're done with that particular street, we don't plan on having to be back in that area, except maybe for some maintenance slurry for ten or 15 years that we're really doing a complete project and then moving on to the next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think we're very excited about some of the funding sources that we have and we're able to address. We're now getting into some of our major corridors. You know, I've had conversations about market before and that is on the list of streets that we're working on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That and dilemma in District eight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of course, we are interested in our District eight projects, but in the interest of everybody's time here, I'm interested in the citywide efforts as well. I think you you hit on something that begs another question. I know we got some communication today from some residents regarding, you know, seeing a line item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The states that we're spending up to $10 million or planning $10 million for for planning and design for for our streets program. Explain how and and what that contra I think that's actually one of our items in in our agenda today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But can you explain how those funds are used for for our our mobility plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Thank you for that opportunity. So the item before the council this evening is an extension of existing on call engineering contracts, and we're asking for a total capacity of $10 million for various design needs. That not only includes our street projects, but it also includes work that we're doing on Shoemaker Bridge, which is a large design'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cost and endeavor for us to take on. So these are budgeted amounts. They aren't actually committed to specific projects, so to speak. It's part of our on call package. Having those engineering contracts in place allows the department to be very nimble in how we design, build and deliver streets throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you go back to the map that I shared earlier, it's one of the reasons that we have had so much progress in the last three years. I think Council for their support in our on call contracts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was one approved earlier this year for All American Asphalt and Sally Miller. So those two large road building contractors are now under contract in the city and allows us to deliver streets much quicker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for that. My next question is for our health department director on this call. AP. Obviously, our health department is doing a lot of work here in the city, a lot of important work, and we appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, the the major issue and the issue of the day is homelessness for and we hear it from our constituents on a daily basis. What are we doing? How are we doing? And we can't do enough. It doesn't appear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But and I but I know we're making a lot of. Progress and not much credit to you, your department and the people that work hard every day for our health department and for the city. My issue always has been and always will be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are we doing enough outreach and does this budget meet your outreach needs for for the city to really make a positive impact on this very important issue?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we conduct outreach every day. We are we are out. And I think the key thing to understand is that we have a planned outreach system and then we have all the phone calls that come in with additional places that people would like us to visit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we often don't have the capacity to make it to all those places, particularly when we you know, there's a there's an a focus on something more quickly. And so to have you know, we often we say, well, we can be out there within 48 hours or something instead of being able to be out there right away'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Um, the measure h funds are funding additional outreach. So right now we have those resources. Our problem is, as you know, at our current capacity, is that we have, you know, people out on sick leave and going back to school and some other things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we are down significantly in our outreach capacity. Um, not, not necessarily due to the funding of it, but more about, uh, with the situation with the people who are outreach workers. Then, you know, they'll come back, we'll get people hired and we'll be able to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the measure H has allowed us to build outreach capacity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And for the the those employees who do this critical function and it's it is really a critical job. What are their work hours and winter normal? What is the normal work week look like for an outreach worker for homeless?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's Monday through Friday. They often go out at 530 or so in the morning so that they can meet people while they're out first thing. The Multi-Service Center is open until approximately 430 every day, but Thursdays it closes a little bit earlier on Thursdays.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not open on the weekends or extended hours from there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So if someone has a need for for or is experiencing something, they have to wait until after basically office hours at this point.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They can call two on one, so they can call the county to run one and get referrals to services. The other is we have the contract with the local motel, so we have vouchers held, right motel rooms held through voucher that are available after later hours to the police department or fire department if they've identified somebody who'",
        "'speaker_11': 'was ready to go into housing. Aside from that, we do not have any other services available. The interesting piece is that the providers of most of those who provide services within the city, if they are shelters, they tend to be full by mid-afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so even if they're, you know, if they were open later to take increase, they don't really they generally don't have any additional beds. So that is certainly an issue. And 125 bed shelter that we're planning to open will have, you know, a very positive impact on that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, that the 24 hour nature of the new shelter will allow for ongoing services. So while we currently don't have the weekend and evening opportunities, the shelter will be able to provide that. So we really see a shift in the ability to access services once that happens.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I know obviously, I know this is a work in progress, but we certainly still have work to do. I'd be more than supportive in terms of extending those hours making. And I know Councilmember Price has talked about this as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's there's this is a 24 hour kind of need in operation and in many respects. The and so the development services. Thank you, Ms.. Tatum. I just want to say your department is, you know, really on overdrive, doing quite a bit of work here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Major development projects, small development projects. You guys are doing it all I do. I think you gave some great, great information regarding our code enforcement and how the numbers are actually up. And I guess they're doing a whole lot more with less if you listen to Mr. Kim vs public comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the up plan I just wanted to just just so give some some praise on on that that work particularly because I know it's going to make a very positive impact. That work is going to have a great positive impact on North Long Beach, my district, as well as a District nine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know it's something that that Councilmember Richardson and I very much support. And so we continue that. I think the zoning work there is going to not only transform North Long Beach, but it's going to also have an impact on the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So keep up the great work. I just want to just give some some comment on that and no real budget comments. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Councilor Marie Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mary and I. Want to piggyback on some of the some of the things that Castmember Austin has said in regards to some of the positive works about being out there. But also, there's some challenges that that we need to face as well in terms of public works.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that, you know, we have our challenges with infrastructure, with sidewalks and streets, especially when we're talking about the deterioration of some of those cement streets that are almost beyond their lifestyle, their life cycle going at 70, 80 years, which is, I think, something like the life cycle of a concrete street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is have you looked at which ones you're looking at to maybe convert into maybe asphalt type street? Or have you identified what areas those would be looking at the next ten years, five years, whatever it is that we need to look at those trees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know there's there's a couple of streets that are really I mean, just in dire, dire need. People complain about their, you know, alignments going off in their vehicles and what have you. So is there is there a plan that you have in place or is it something that's coming in the very near future?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Murang'a, you are correct. We do have some street segments within our citywide network that is constructed of concrete entirely of concrete. And while concrete streets tend to last longer than an asphalt street. They're also extremely expensive to replace.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we've been struggling with that cost and managing the replacement of different segments. Part of the challenge is many of our concrete streets are within historic neighborhoods. And as we start having discussions about doing an overlay or putting asphalt on top of those streets to try to repair them, community members have come out and expressed concern about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the historic nature of their street, or rather the concrete street, adding to the historic nature of their neighborhood and community, and have essentially asked us to not put asphalt streets down. So that's a struggle that we're trying to work through, knowing that there's a significant cost to replace with concrete versus doing an asphalt overlay is really been'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the biggest challenge and something we'll continue to work on as we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do you have any. Ideas, any kinds of out of the box type of thinking that we could use or maybe that the city council can look at to perhaps set a set out, set aside some funding that will address perhaps the the worst concrete streets so that we can improve those, especially if we, as you mentioned, and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we'll have one of the largest historic areas in my district, and it's all concrete. And when you look at repairs that I've made, rephrase it that we have made in the city in regards to street improvements and so well prepares.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It just stands out. There's nothing that that's been taking place in that area because the majority is concrete. But I think that the time is arriving where we need to look at how we're going to mitigate that, how are we going to repair those kinds of streets with concrete, like for like so that it can maintain the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the integrity of those neighborhoods, perhaps what we might want to do and we can do it tonight. But obviously, I think we need to look at some future discussions as to how we can leverage some of these budgets that we're getting the funds, major funds to put to the side so that we can address especially those those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are streets in in a historical district so that we can repair to maintain the integrity of those districts and maintain the quality of life that people have gotten used to in the streets in that area. So I'm just throwing it out there as a as a thought.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, we could have off of the mike discussions afterwards when we when we meet at our regular meetings to talk about how we can address this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And certainly happen to work with you on on moving this forward. And I did want to share that, that there is an out of the box idea that the team has come up with and that is colored asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there is a way to lay asphalt that isn't the typical black asphalt that you see in a street. But we can get it to a color that could be very close to matching what a concrete street looks like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that might be an alternative that works in those historic neighborhoods. Those are things that we're exploring. We wanted to try to get a sample so we could put a call it a pilot paving, if you will, of what that might look like and see if it's something that we would consider moving forward with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So those are some of the things that we're working on. But yeah, continue to work with you on trying to figure out a way to address those streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Really. I'm really glad to hear that because obviously we need to think about new and innovative ways of how to address these these big challenges that we had that we have in regards to development services. You know, one of the biggest challenges that I have in my district and probably, you know, citywide is the zoning that we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have. We just went through a major Alawi exercise two years back, looking at our transportation corridors. What we could do there, and especially we were talking about the housing elements in regards to affordable housing, transitional housing and how we could address our homeless and mobility issues with the city in regards to getting people to and from places'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to work and also be able to afford to live in Long Beach as well. So I mean, and a lot of that has to do with with with how we how we structure our our code in terms of those corridors, residential, commercial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Remain. Are the other ones. At last track rate, residential commercial. And there's a third one there. I can't think of it right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Industrial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Industrial, of course. Industrial. So, I mean, it's it's it becomes an issue sometimes in some neighborhoods. I know that was a major a big discussion when we're going through the Allawi discussion, because there were some residents who were concerned that some of these changes that we were looking at would affect residential areas in regards to heights.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And some of the buildings around residential neighborhoods, especially around the corridors that are that are adjacent to two neighborhoods where you would have aa4 or five storey building going up and there would be a single family homes right behind that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that still continues, I think, to be to be a concern. And and so I think we have people who are monitoring that very closely because they don't want that intrusion of a five or six storey building that is going to be looking into people's front yards or backyards.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think we still have to be very careful, I think, in that area as far as what we're what we're proposing to do. And I'm especially concerned with with some some of the. The the the the zoning that we have in some of the corridors, it's, you know, you know exactly what I'm talking about in terms'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of Santa Fe. I mean, it's that Santa Fe corridor that I have there has so much potential. And it did have potential at one time, but because of the changes nature of it was it was incremental or or how it happened.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, that whole corridor is just a mishmash of all kinds of different. Commercial, industrial, residential. It's crazy, you know, and it really, I think, hampers how we address the West Long Beach area, especially in that Santa Fe corridor, because there are restrictions and and the and the codes that are there in residential, commercial and the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'ability to build a residence right on Santa Fe that you had is totally, completely out of place. And you know what I'm talking about? I mean, that that shouldn't have to happen, but I want to prevent that happening again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm going to be obviously discussing with you and looking at ways that we can create more opportunities for development. That's going to be very, very beneficial to the community, to the West Long Beach community in regards to business development as well as providing improved housing opportunities along that corridor as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So and what are the major obstacles I think that we have here is and I don't know you you probably can tell me, is being able to adjust change. Get rid of. Some of those measures that that restrict us from being able to provide greater business and economic development and in that area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's something that, again, something we can't deal with right now tonight. But I want to throw it out there as as a a need in that area, because I'm you know, I'm constantly being confronted with we're not doing anything for the we're saying we're not doing anything for Santa Fe Corridor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the understanding is, well, you know, the the zoning laws, the zoning rules in that area prevent us from doing that. I mean, I have to give kudos to the eighth and ninth districts for being able to do such the other such a great job and what they're doing with the with economic development in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But they were able to do so because contiguous is a nice it's a nice contiguous community that they can do that. Not nothing like I can do that in West Palm Beach because zoning rules restrict us from doing that, and we need to revisit that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm really getting passionate about this because I really feel that, you know, our hands are tied because of the zoning rules that we have in that area. And that includes Will Willow Street as well. That goes from the freeway to to the border to L.A. and that that also has a mixed use mishmash of different zoning'",
        "'speaker_6': 'rules, where you have houses next door to businesses, next door to churches that just me makes that corridor a complete mess. And we need to be able to be able to correct that. We're going into a future here where we want to build real, good communities for people to want to live there and that and be proud'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that they're living in that area. And if we have zoning laws and rules that restrict that, I think that needs to be corrected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that councilman will be happy to work with you to address some of those issues. You're correct. We do understand where they are and will be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We hope we will. Thank you very much. In terms of the health department, you know, again, the health department is just amazing in everything that you're able to do with grants and what, 97%. Of your budget is grants and funding in the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Excuse me. Are you? Well, yeah. What's 2% now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So 85% comes from grants, about 15% comes from fees, or maybe 13% comes from fees like the environmental health. And the other 2% comes from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you continue to face challenges. And, you know, I was, as mentioned earlier in terms of the, you know, STD, STD investigations that you have to do and and the TB education investigations you had to do so many and and with limited staff and you do quite a bit with what you have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that having been a former Health Department employee, I know the great work and the commitment that individuals have there because they might they might not be able to get the great big bucks that they probably deserve. But it's a labor of love and they love their work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they really have a lot of kudos for for the health department and the employees that work there, because they really do have a commitment to service in Long Beach and especially working with the health department. But we do have some challenges, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have our language access program that is in your department, in your area. I know that you have increased the allotment for a full time language access program coordinator, which is great. But if you heard tonight, as you heard tonight, we had quite a number of residents come up here and say, you know, I came for a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'service and I didn't get it. Because there was a language barrier. So we need to improve that. And I could understand, if not only in your lap or in the health in the health department. It's a citywide issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think we need to look at at different departments, especially those that have a lot of public contact, like commercial services, where they go up and pay their bills. We need to provide we have to provide more opportunities to hire bilingual staff and provide them with the bilingual pay that they deserve in order to provide that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'service. So this is that's a citywide type of issue. And I don't know if the EEOC is is capable of doing that. Okay. I must ask father part. I must say, I fell in love anyway. Where was I?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anyway, bottom line is that. That when it comes down to. Service, sir, increasing our ability to serve the communities, especially when in the diversity with languages and with cultures. I think we were not doing the best job that we possibly can to serve those communities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's and as we move forward. Long Beach has become increasingly diverse. Increasingly people of color. Increasingly, people with different languages that speak here. So, I mean, we need to move forward. We need to progress with that so that we can start getting better service to our communities who need that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I know it's not you per se, but having a full time language access program coordinator, I think provides us that opportunity to to address that, that issue that we're getting. And it's it's only going to get worse.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we really need to be a little bit more proactive in trying to address the language needs of our communities, because it's it's it's it's an increasing issue that's coming up. And then one last thing that I wanted to to get before I get off my soapbox.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know we're I'm one on one right now. It is the is the the issue with geez, I lost my track at that rainbow train of thought. Anyway, I'll just go ahead and stop there for Don. If it comes back, I'll re line up and bring it back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think it's, it's it's phenomenal what you're doing with the the budget that you have. I and I've repeatedly said again and again, especially right around this time of year, budget budget time is that we need to look at institutionalizing much of the services that you do and get away from grants.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need to start we need to institutionalize what we're doing with STD education and investigations. Well, what we doing with homeless homeless services we need to that those need to be part part of the essential services that the city provides and that have to rely on grants.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm off by soapbox. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Good evening, everyone. How you guys doing? Yeah, it's like almost 11 and I've got a long list, but I'm going to talk excitedly for you guys if I could. Okay. So I'm going to start with public works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just overall, again, these three departments, just like last Tuesday, you guys are essential to my constituents, the city of Long Beach as a whole. I'm very impressed with the changes that we've made from year to year, recognizing that we've brought on a whole new industry cannabis into the city and tried to regulate not only retail manufacturing'",
        "'speaker_4': ', understand that that's a challenge that we're undertaking, a huge CHP projects. And so just overall, I've enjoyed working with all the directors and really appreciate you guys working with us to deliver the needs that our constituents are really asking for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll start with public works. The first question is really around our mobility plan. I know that we talked last time around making sure that enforcement was really key for our scooters and our bikes and making sure we're getting those off the sidewalks in our business corridors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also know that in downtown we have a lot of tourists and that those are often the people that ride the scooters on the sidewalks, that ride kind of erratically and aren't getting to work to home. And so we've had lots of conversations around what the D Cal program looks like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know we don't want them, you know, every two feet. I know we don't want five different organizations putting them on our sidewalks. So I hope that you can share with us what the DeKalb plan is and if that's included in this budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So kind of going back to the presentation we made on our Micromobility program, good news. We're about ready to release our MICROMOBILITY permit for the permanent program. And Councilmember, if you remember during that presentation, we wanted to come up with a modified drop zone vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And within that modified drop zone vehicle, it would include language relative to no writing on the sidewalk. Plus, our new program really strengthens the rider education component as something that is it was part of our pilot program, but it was a much weaker component that we believe that the new program, working with the vendors who want to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'do business in Long Beach, will have to really strive to implement better rider education, information, training videos, regular tests, if you will, just as more of a safety reminder. And so those are those pieces together, I think Will along with some enforcement that we're working with the police department on, some specialized enforcement paid for from these fees'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we'll get out of the MICROMOBILITY program will help address some of the sidewalk writing that we're experiencing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you for that. When we're talking about our street repairs and street request in the second District, the most requests I get are for our alleyways. And I you know, I take an alleyway every single day and it feels like off roading, but it's just so much easier to get to the street that I need to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get to. What is a realistic timeline around? I know we have an alleyway plan. I know that with Measure eight, we're doing the dirt roads first. Can you just talk a little bit more about the Alleyway plan and funding that's needed for that and kind of what's happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To do that? Similar to our payment management plan, we did a similar thing for all of our alleys. We know our conditions of those alleys and their relative need. It's roughly $100 million. I think the number is 98.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the presentation, we have the $5 million commitment for Measure two to pave the dirt alleys. So that's really good news. We'll finish that in fiscal year 20, but we haven't yet identified funding for repairing the alleys moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of our challenges, Measure eight, gives us some flexibility. Most of our transportation dollars are tied to just that, to transportation and alleys are typically not eligible for fund for those type of funds. So I look forward to working with this council, moving forward on identifying dollars that can help us address kind of that next level of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of problem. Alley We know we have some that aren't dirt but are very, very close, you know, asphalt that has worn away, large pothole segments, new grading that needs to occur because there's retention of water. And so I certainly realize that every district could point to really, really bad alleys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm looking forward to try to find funding to be able to address those moving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, hopefully in the next year we can try to work on that a little bit more. Definitely the second district, I think because we have so many multifamily areas, people really do use the alleyways as additional roads and so it is a question I get asked often.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I needed to make sure that I asked for everyone. The next question I have is just around staffing. It looks like you're doing a great job with interns. I, I start as an intern at Lane before I became staff, so I have great appreciation for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a plan to take interns to full staff? Because I know that you have staff openings, so I didn't know what the plan was to fill those openings if it was with interns or so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I certainly agree. We have a great partnership with our colleges and we have been able to attract a lot of bright young men and women who want to come and see what we see, what it's like to work in public works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it gives them a good on the job training opportunity and gives us a good resource to be able to to get some things done. I'm a strong believer in giving folks an opportunity to move into the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we'll be working with civil service to make sure that there are those testing opportunities and that our interns are eligible to take those tests and get on lists so we can ultimately hire them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Awesome. Thank you. I want to give you props for Vision Zero. I think this year you guys have really stepped it up. I know that in the second district, we're obviously having a lot of conversations around that. I also this year will be spending some of our divide by nine funds to focus on Seventh Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I'll be just on the visioning. So I really look forward to working very closely with you guys. So we're doing that with you and, you know, looking at planning and making sure that we don't have a vision that doesn't set with the city parameters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So looking forward to that and the thanks for giving props to AOC seven. They definitely rock. My next my next focus is going to be on development services. But my first question is really for both of you guys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that we have a lot of businesses and particularly in the cannabis industry that I get complaints on around how they go forward with the permit process. And I think it's there's permits with public works and there's permits with development services and trying to understand, you know, alignment with those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand in the past there was more coordination or that's what I was told by a previous member of this body, that there was coordination to make sure that people had one point person that was able to really talk them through both public works requirements and development services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there anything in the budget or process right now within your departments to make sure that. That that those things are clear to people that are trying to go through the permit process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say that generally the the planning department, because we issue the entitlements and we coordinate with all of the other departments for the comments that those other departments have on a project. As it goes through the process, we tend to tend to be the lead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we do have a key contact person in public works that we coordinate any development project with. And that point person coordinates with all of the other bureaus and divisions within public works. So I think we do have a fairly, fairly well-defined process for coordinating.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The thing I would point out is that in addition to public works and planning for all the permitting, there is a separate process that these cannabis projects need to go through, and that's out of the city, the city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think we do have a fairly well-defined process, but probably like anything it could be better. And to the extent that we have a feedback on, I guess, critical areas that we need to address, we're certainly more than happy to take a closer look at how we can improve those, but we didn't propose any additional funding'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the budget for that purpose. But I would just mention one other based upon the Council direction a few months ago. One of the things we are looking at is, is are just ways to streamline and make it a little bit easier for those businesses to go through the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the results of that will be coming back to you in the next, I'm going to say the next few months. So hopefully we can take a look at that. I guess the development in the permitting process to see if there are ways that we can continue to work on streamlining the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's been I think I would add just two quick things to Linda's comments. And one is our new building permit center. If anybody hasn't been there, they should go. We've been able to co-locate a business license, public works, planning, building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Everybody sits now on the second floor. So that's kind of a truly one stop shop. So that's going to help everything become more efficient. And then I mentioned earlier in my presentation that Public Works has just released a development guideline, and that's really intended to help people walk through the public works process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're happy to put any companies that have questions in touch with our operation. And within that guideline book, it provides very definitive timelines of when people should expect to get a response back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's great. I didn't hear that. Thank you for that. I do know that in our economic development services, one of the things that they did, you know, a couple of years ago was really doing the online portal for small businesses that were trying to open up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that technology sometimes is our strongest suit and sometimes we feel light years behind. And so anything we can do to think about technology in that effort, whether it's an online timeline where you're here and here's the department you talk to next, obviously would be awesome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But thank you guys for for answering that direct question. For Development Services, I want to thank you for the work that you've done on housing, on the short term rentals and bringing staff on to do that and all the stuff that you brought on last year's budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really am impressed with that and I appreciate the additional community outreach. Obviously, it's an area we can always do try to strive to be our best at. Let me see. I want to make sure I find my notes before I pass on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My team is writing notes in my Google doc as I'm talking like I'm going to read this. I love you guys. You're awesome. Let's see. Development services, technology on the Cup, focusing on restaurants and entertainment. How are you guys going to engage the community members like we did on the first up overhaul?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you repeat the first part of that? What effort?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You mentioned the second phase of updating the CFP process in your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. I did not. I talked about the cannabis process. That's the one thing we're taking a look at. Was that what you meant?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. In not in your presentation. In the budget book, it talks about focusing on restaurants and entertainment uses next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we will. We have a standard protocol for doing community outreach. And what we would typically do is identify a couple of different phases. First, the general public to get their feedback, but we also like to make it a point to reach out very specifically to stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So to the extent that we're trying to target restaurants or any specific entity in the business community, we would make it a point to work directly with our economic development department, chambers of Commerce, or anybody that could make sure that we're reaching out to the folks who are going to be most affected to make sure that that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'input is is incorporated into whatever we bring back to council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate that. I remember when we did the CFP process the first time when we tried to do a lot of outreach, there was a lot of business owners that were scared, for whatever reason, to talk to the city and to share their honest opinion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The people that we did get to the table when we had the City Roundtable were the people that were willing to talk. A lot of them were restaurant owners. And so I would encourage you to go back to that list and engage those that are willing to really be honest with the city so that we get honest'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feedback. So that that would be my request on that. And that's all I have for for those two departments. I really appreciate, again, you guys have done a great job in addressing the concerns that we've brought up. Now for the Health Department, I feel like I'm the cheerleader of the health department.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every budget cycle this microphone is so far, I feel like I'm leaning over the table. You do a lot with a small amount from the general fund, which I'm greatly appreciative of. As was mentioned by the mayor, our city numbers are absolutely unacceptable and I think it's been great to see the funding that we added last year's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'budget really out on the streets. We've really seen the mobile unit. I actually went and did my own, you know, we had it at the park. I went and did my acid test right there with the mobile unit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody was fantastic. They served a lot of people that day. I think that the numbers that we have there are great. My question is, in your in the strategic plan, we do a lot of great plans. And then you got to come to us at the budget and you got to beg for kind of crumbs, you know'",
        "'speaker_4': ', identifying $2 million and identifying the necessary funds to make sure that our state plan is real is going to be difficult. And so I just I want to say whatever help we can do to try to identify grants and partnerships with other organizations, I know in the planning groups, we have a lot of great people at the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'table, but I also know we have a lot of great people at Cal State, Long Beach and professors that want to help do the work and doctors that want to help do the work. So anything that we can do, because now Carla has really been engrossed in that community to make sure that we're using all the resources'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we have at our fingertips, because it is an epidemic that could get worse if we're not really tackling it. I wanted to comment on the Office of Aging. I wasn't here when the council directed staff to create the Office of Aging with that staff person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a plan, a strategic plan for our aging adults. What is what does it look like not to have staffing for that department? I mean, my district is 35% seniors. And now that we have a plan without a staff person budgeted, what does that mean for us?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we had one time funding that we were able to carry over through accessing some small grants to make it through two years. That funding ends as of October one. That position is the one who is driving our Healthy Aging Center all the additional older adults strategic planning that is taking place or an age friendly initiative.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The key areas of focus are really housing and homelessness, as we are seeing increasing numbers of older adults becoming homeless. Transportation is a core issue that comes up all the time health, safety at home, in the community and quality of life.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of the key things we're really trying to do is how do we bring an age friendly lens to all the work of the city so that every time we plan, every conversation also acknowledges the fact that we need to look at it a little bit differently and a sort of a universal approach for older adults.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So without somebody in that space, those things get set aside or they're piecemeal together whenever someone has some time to focus on it. And the data show that by 2030, five, older adults over the age of 65 will outnumber the number of children under the age of 18.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we've got about 15 years to get ourselves really together, to be able to have the systems and services in place. And our older adults within the city are becoming more diverse and generally lower income are seeing higher levels of poverty and homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's a lot of work to be done there and there will not be anybody to hold that space. We do have a public health nurse. We do have a half time mental health social worker who does co-locate at the Fore Street Senior Center to provide services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. I mean, looking at the at the strategic plan that you guys presented, when I look at the needs and the opportunities, the opportunities seem really large and they don't seem like we're tackling with all the resources that we that we need to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so understanding that sometimes our senior population is also the most difficult populations to reach, whether because of the housing that they live in or whether it's because they don't trust, because there's so much fraud that happens out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would love to see us have that staff person back and I don't know where my colleagues are on that, but I know that my constituents are just getting used to having that staff staff person there. We had five senior roundtables where she's been able to come out, and it's been a huge resource of sharing information that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these people didn't know was there. And so it's something that I would like to explore. The second part, I think you'll no one's going to be surprised, but the language access policy for 2020 have been again around since the beginning of this advocacy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was really proud of us in the last two years and the progress we made with the conversations on this council. Unfortunately, there's not a representative for District One, but I do know that that is a district that has the largest number of Spanish speakers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The needs have not decreased by 50%. And so the idea that we would put in 50% of the funding. I'm just really confused by that. I really don't understand why we would reduce that funding whenever we actually need more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know that whenever we go out and we educate the community that the government is here to work with them, where often there's not a lot of trust with the government, where often they don't know that they can come and actually communicate with the people that are supposed to represent them, then our democracy is flawed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is at the core of what cities do. This is what big kids cities do. L.A. does, Sacramento does, San Francisco. They have a language access plan that is real, and it is baked into to every fabric of what they do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate that we have on here funding Francesca's position full time, totally support that the idea of skill pay, bilingual skill pay. I've heard a lot of stories about what workers can get it, what workers can't. Every department should have somebody that has bilingual skill pay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every department interfaces with the public in some way. Every department has someone that picks up the phone and is talking to a constituent in a different language. What we talked about last time was really how we make it structural, and that's not just about that position being full time, but that it's been for the last two budgets'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that I've been a part of. We've talked about having people in every single department be responsible for translation and making sure that we don't have like the water department. Right. Right now we're talking about rate changes, but we only have information in English.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So how are we making sure that every constituent out there is able to know what's happening? So that's what when we talked about whether it's Rex uses his baked in sprinkled on top you know thing but that's what we mean by language.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Access cannot just be the council saying, hey, we have language access. It has to be in the culture of every single department where those people have a budget item, a line item in every single department that says, here's what we're using so that we are a city that is accessible to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I support in the, you know, the what we call in this people's budget should know that by now. I definitely support, you know, making the full time position, the bilingual school pay interpretation, translation and community stipends on outreach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I know we did a budget meeting recently that was supposed to be bilingual, that a flier didn't get translated for the bilingual budget meeting until very recently before. That's not a city that has a culture of language access.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think that we can do better. We're a city that has shown ourselves to be really great at doing a lot of awesome things. So I that's my that's my pitch today is that our health department needs to continue doing the great work that they that they do, that if we do strategic plans, that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also need to have a plan to implement those strategic plans and not shy away from that. And if we're going to have language access, if we're going to be that city that is diverse, that we actually create a culture where residents can count on coming to meetings and them being accessible to everyone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I probably have more. I have one more for public works, trees, tree trimming. Tree trimming plan. Can you walk me through that real fast?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently, the city has funded about $1,000,000 annually for tree trimming. Given the number of trees that we have citywide that allows us to trim on a seven year cycle. So we essentially have split the city up into seven segments and we do one segment each year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also have some funding for emergency tree removal, and we've we're starting to experience that more and more during storms that we're losing trees, most of our urban forest and all. We have a number of new trees planted, but most of our urban forest is at the end of their typical tree life somewhere in the 70 year'",
        "'speaker_1': 'range. And I think Councilmember Mungo had had mentioned at the BMC that we are seeing a number of tree losses and we're trying to ramp up our ability to replace those moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you every single one of you for your help. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, we'll move on, Mr. Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. So I'll start. Thank you, all of you, for your presentations. I'll start with public works. So. Mr. Beck, I was looking at the public the parking operations that we have. And I would have thought that with the implementation and the installation of our smart meter technology, that our parking revenues would have gone up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it seems like the the revenues have stayed pretty stable. Um, in looking at page 83 on our budget summary. Can you speak to that at all?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And certainly I think when you look at the overall parking revenue for this fiscal year, we had a large drop off because of the construction projects that we experienced in the downtown. So for a number of months, almost six months, we had no meters active in two of our main corridors on third and on Broadway in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'downtown area. We're just getting those meters installed and back online, so we're hopeful to get back up to speed in our anticipated parking revenues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It looks like I mean, the highest we've been was in in 2018 and then we dipped down. So unless I'm reading this wrong, I mean, I was thinking that the increase would be significant with the installation of the smart meters and our ability to be more efficient with enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we expect that that number, even from the 2018 period of time, will go up a lot higher once all of our lots are on the smart meters and operating?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I think that and as I mentioned earlier, if the pilot with the automated license plate reading comes through as we anticipate it will, that will also help us be more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will say the parking citation revenue increased dramatically and I don't know how much of that had to do with I know we had a slight increase, but that's recent. And then the smart meters. That's a good revenue source for the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a steady revenue source for the city. But do you know what that increase could be attributed to? Is a combination or is it mostly the smart meter technology?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. The question was parking enforcement citation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Revenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, so the council adopted an increase to the parking citation amount and that went up $10 per unit. This fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So that's why the proposal is about 2 million more. Okay. Makes sense. Curtis. Okay. We had some revenue changes that I noted in your summary, your budget summary on page four of three. And it looks like it was pretty significant from it was revenue from other agencies went down from 434 million in 18 to 25 million'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Now is that and actually went down and in 19 and 20 what is that attributed to that $10 million difference. If you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I am on page 403.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Revenue from other agencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can get those details and provide those to you in in more specifics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I'm assuming it's probably, you know, revenue that we got maybe from the state or county that that ended. And I just want to know, moving forward, if we're expecting that backer or not. You talked about $21 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I don't know how what you referred to it as, whether it was emergency funds or. Councilman Austin was asking you about that $1 million. I'm sorry. What?'",
        "'speaker_1': '$1 million?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, $1 million. Correct. I heard $21 million.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I heard you elevate that. I'm. I'm happy to receive 21 million. Happy to put that to good use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. But that's just. And that's for emergency repairs.'",
        "'speaker_1': '$1 million for emergency repairs? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we were to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Identify additional moneys for Ali's for FY 20, would we be able to? How feasible would it be to allocate that money on a divide by nine type basis so that every district could get a portion of that additional moneys to be able to repave an alley or two?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think as your public works director, I would recommend one of two options. Either that that you equally divide the money or you do it by need. And we when I say by need, what we would look at is a total.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Call it square footage of Ali's spread across the city. And then you would divide it by that percentage. So if District three had 10% of the alleys citywide and District four had 12% of the Ali's, you would divide the numbers by those percentages.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what we did with the extra million dollars that we received for path of travel sidewalks. We we divided it by need based on the number of sidewalk square footage by district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So there would be a mechanism to ensure, you know, the entire city benefits from additional funds that we'd be able to allocate to a specific need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay, Fer. Thank you, Mr. Beck, for our Development Services budget. And this may be a better question for Mr. GROSS. Is he still here? Oh, yeah. There he is. Well, I don't know. On page one, 91, it looks like there's a property tax decrease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why 20 in terms of your anticipated revenues. Why is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That? Because, general, overall, for the city, there's a property tax increase. The property tax that we receive is based on our enforceable obligations. Sorry. The property tax that we receive is based on our enforceable obligations that we put on our ROPS and our enforceable obligations are going down primarily due to this was our last year to repay'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our city agency loan and that had been a significant amount.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got it. Request. Okay. Thank you. That makes a lot of sense. The other thing that I noticed was the and I didn't put the note on the transfer to other funds. From Development Services. Oh, yeah, here it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so on that same page, transfer to other funds in FY 18 was 26 million, and then it went up to.'",
        "'speaker_4': '42.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then it drops dramatically for the proposed Y is that that's got to be attributed to something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So also the ROPS but. We'll have to get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. No problem. It just it's just a very dramatic dip, like, you know, 40 million. Okay for our health department. How feasible would it be for the Health Department's Multi-Service Center to develop a skeleton crew for the weekends at the Multi-Service Center?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've looked at various staffing models about what it would take to operate there, and the resources really run between the half million dollars. Um. For a year. For a year. With Saturdays open range between a fully staffed all new by completely stout.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Otherwise we would be looking at people trying, you know, working overtime and other sort of situations. And so it ranges between a half million to $700,000 per year to be open on Saturdays, and that's twice that number on Sundays.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The issue is that when people come in, you still have to have security, you still have to have supervisors in the building. You have to have people who can assess. So even in a skeleton crew, minimum is between six and about six people by the time everything is covered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the 500, 500 is 700 for Saturdays and a million for Saturdays and Sundays. That's on a regular staff. Not regular staff as part of their their hours, not overtime hours, just regular.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if we were going from leaning toward the $500,000 per day rate or, you know, for a Saturday and then another 500,000 for Sundays, that would be hiring some part time staff, some overtime staff and coverage when we moved to the $750,000 range.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is full time news staff. And they would be operating. They would be they would be full time staff. They would also work early, you know, other days of that week to be able to cover additional capacities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Is there any model that you've looked at that doesn't involve opening the center, but having caseworkers or other support people available on weekends or working on weekends? Does it have to be tied to the center?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think the issue there is that, I mean, we could do outreach on the weekends and do that. The issue is, where do we do the assessments? Where do we connect people to services? And the key thing for us is that most of our providers also don't do intake on the weekends, almost any of them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so when it comes to if they needed shelter or if they needed some level of care, we would not be able to connect them to that care on the weekends. Um, if we can, if, if we have a center for people to engage in, then we, then we continue to do that work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then we would look at the possibility of renegotiating some of our contracts or seeing if there would be others to help support those services within the Multi-Service Center. So I think without a place to go, we can do outreach and reconnect people, but then they still have to come into the multi-service center and and do all'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the full assessments and everything it is to actually start to engage in services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What about if the service was was limited to maybe providing motel vouchers for that night or for two nights until the multi-service centers open and facilities have intake operations available? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're doing that already through the that you know, we're holding the two motel rooms with vouchers per night. And that's exactly what's happening, is that they're being housed in a motel and then they come into the multi-service center the next day and they provide and then they can access services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's how that model works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we're not doing that on the weekends.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're not. I'm just saying that that's what that we could look at that mechanism. Good. Right? Oh, they do. On the weekends. That does happen on the weekends. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not on the weekends. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For those two motel rooms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So so what I'm hearing you say is it really wouldn't be very probably would not be a good use of city resources to open the multi-service center on the weekends anyway, because they wouldn't be able to get anyone into a service because there's no intake on weekends for most of the service providers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct. I think when we have the, when we have the, the year round shelter open, um, that's a 24 hour operation in that space we would be able to do intakes and connection and have people to land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So at that, at that time, it really does sort of shift the face of accessibility to service overall. Um, but until that time, we have a hard time with working with our providers to access services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. Because I think a lot of us were wondering, you know, if we're assuming there would be a lot of benefits to having the multi-service center open on the weekends. And what I'm hearing is there probably would be some benefit, but it would be limited in nature in terms of placement'",
        "'speaker_3': '. That's correct. The outreach teams that we have working on the weekends, I didn't know we had outreach teams working on the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, we don't.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We could if we were going to open the Multi-Service Center on the weekends, part of that team could be outreach teams that could go out, could be conducting outreach, bring people back to the multi-service and go through those service miles.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We don't currently have that as our operational OC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could we have an outreach teams that worked on the weekends without the Multi-Service Center being open to give vouchers to people to stay in a hotel, to check in a multi-service center that Monday?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We can look at what that would take. Okay. So currently right now, the place, you know, the so the police officers have the opportunity to utilize those two vouchers. We don't conduct any other operations in the quality of life team does not operate on the weekends either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So really the. We could look at a model of outreach. Um. In partnership with the police department and others to determine if we could pull that off and I could bring back information on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be really great. I think that's something we'd be interested. Maybe we do a pilot where there is a collaborative effort on the weekends and those individuals are housed temporarily for the weekend until they can come in to the Multi-Service Center that Monday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That way there's, you know, there's a close eye on them and they can have transportation and access.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we'll put well, we'll look at what that could be and we'll make sure to bring that forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. How does our how do we currently decide what part of the city we conduct outreach in? Is it complaint driven? Is there a schedule?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's a schedule. So the city is broken into into sort of segments and those are all visited. So we visit, um, we visit each site at least ten times in a month. And we go out to over 100 sites.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we're all over the city. And then on top of that, when we receive calls to the Multi-Service Center, we then respond as as we have capacity to respond to those addition to those additional calls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Let me ask you this one other question about this weekend of this weekend option. Yeah. Would it be possible in the weekend option that the individual that's working that weekend, the case worker that might be helping doing the outreach, could also follow up with, you know, kind of keep that that case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like if they make a connection with someone on a weekend, give them a voucher to come to Multi-Service Center on Monday, that they'd be able to be the person that that person sees. It's not guaranteed. But would that would the individual that's working at the Multi-Service Center also be able to do the outreach on the weekends, having'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that continuity?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, we can do that. I think we would just have to look at what the staffing is and what the days are that they're working in those kind of things. But we do I mean, that is the way relationships are built as our outreach workers.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So our outreach workers know just about everybody by name on the streets, as do those. You know, our quality of life workers and the Hart team. So I think those relationships do exist. And we could continue to to build on that with the outreach workers don't do case management necessarily.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we would then when they come into the multi-service center, lead into a straight into the into the ongoing assessment and case management process. But that would likely be with somebody else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And Ms.. Colby, I know you're really involved with the collaborative efforts of all the departments in terms of homeless outreach. So when you're bringing this item back, I would love to see is there a model that could work on the weekends where we have collaborative partners, police and homeless services working together to do some directed efforts'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in particular areas. So what would that kind of look like?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Me and I will have to do back and we did do a pilot of a couple of Saturdays where we went out and did proactive outreach and response. I think it was just in the mornings, but we'll go back and look at that and see what the costs were for that, what that model looks like.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we can we can work from there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would love loved to see that data. Thank you very much and know no pressure, but the sooner the better on that because I think we're thinking about options for for this budget cycle. So in terms of okay, so on page 301, of course, I made these notes when I was reviewing the budget this weekend and I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'don't remember what's on what page on page 301, we from FY 18 to 20. It looks like the other other revenues. So in FY 18, obviously the other revenues was in the $300,000 range and now we're closed. The proposed is close to a $5 million range.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is that? Is that from grant funds? I'm assuming it is, but I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They're looking for the page. So I wasn't paying for getting people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what's the question again?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rio one under other revenues, if you look at Fy18, we're at 351,000, but then it goes up to, you know, above 4 million. So what is the source of that other revenue?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It looks like measure H.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Measure H. Wow.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We received an a significant increase in Measure H funding, that is outreach and other and other sources from the county.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we expect that to continue long term?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is an ongoing funding source. But yeah, it's a ten year funding source. Um, the way that it is distributed. So we receive, we receive a direct allocation based on the percentage of homeless population that the city is of the counties of the county's homeless count.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um, and then we received those revenues only for those, um, for those strategies that Lahsa, which is the county S.O.S. receives. So that's, that's what we get. So it basically covers, um, it covers five different strategies, but it would be ongoing, that is outreach, prevention, rehab and rapid rehousing is the end.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, outreach prevention. Rapid rehousing are the primary areas as well as support in doing the continuum of care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, that's that's honestly, I did not realize how much of an increase that was to the to the city. That's huge. And I think that's really important for us to to highlight in terms of those county dollars. That's huge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And looking at on that same page, I noticed that the amount of overtime that was used in the Health Department in FY 18. Was more than double what we're proposing in FY 20 and as well as 19.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So is that because your staffing model has changed or because overtime dollars are not as readily available to you?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have had a large number of vacancies and we've been requiring staff to work. We've been asking staff to work overtime to cover. So when we're talking about these measles outbreaks and all of those, that is all overtime work and with vacancies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what we're doing is we are we are working to fill those staffing positions moving forward so that we're not paying the overtime.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Because we're paying less in FY 20 and overtime and in FY19 and overtime than we did in FY 18.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. So we've been building we've been building, we have been hiring so that we're not paying we're not in the overtime structure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Got it. Thank you. Okay. On page 84, there's a $9 million reserve for the health department. And I'm wondering where that comes from. What is that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the reserve comes. So each year at the end of the year there we, you know, after we've we've closed out the budgets into about ten years ago, we were actually in a deficit situation, unable to make payroll.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Since that time, we've been moving forward so that each year that we we work to have to hold some of those funds that we receive and we put it into a reserve. Our goal is a six month reserve so that if grants and we don't have any way to cover people, if at the federal level for some'",
        "'speaker_11': 'reason, you know, when we've had shutdowns, we are very concerned about how we pay for the housing authority and all those things. So we've just through strong fiscal discipline and prudence, we've been holding those funds. They come primarily from re-alignment funding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um, so what we've been, you know, and also a lot of, from vacancies when we're unable to fill positions out of realignment and those, those go into the reserve. So we're utilizing those for the six month reserve and we've been utilizing those funds for the HIV, STD positions and other things that the that we don't have ongoing'",
        "'speaker_11': 'funding for. Sometimes we dip in for one time funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. But your intention though, for that $9 million is to continue that reserve and not tap into it in 20.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. Well, we are we will be tapping into it for the HIV CD, the tune of $250,000 this year and again next year. Um, that and then the, um, we, we, our intent is to maintain that reserve.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we do have different things that come to us because we are a grant organization through audits and other things that sometimes we do, we pay back. We want to make sure that we have the resources available to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And these reserves are these reserves. General fund reserves.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They are not. They're re-alignment funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. What can realignment funding be used for?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Public health?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Public health? How broad is that category?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's the work. It's the I mean, it's the work of the public health department, um, moving forward. So we receive approximately it's been between seven and $8 million a year from the state that comes through, that comes to based on population.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those are only on those are only funds that do not have a specific outcome or other. They pay my salary. They pay my administration salary, pays for the lab, pays for vector. It pays for a lot of other things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Any funding that we have available left over from that, that's what goes into the reserve and is held as a public health focus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So basically anything that you do in your department, not the housing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It does not it cannot be utilized for homeless services and other things that are the human services portion of our department cannot be utilized out of that fund. It's very much specific to public health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. All right. I don't have any other questions at this time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. For those watching this meeting or not tonight, it's it's after 11:30 p.m.. So I'm going to streamline my comments because I promised Vice Mayor Andrews I'd get him on before midnight. I guess I'll start with the Health Department and there's so many topics we could talk about, especially the homeless issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But indifference to today, which happens to be August 20th, happens to be World Mosquito Day. And I appreciate that Kelly mentioned that in her comments. And the American Mosquito Control Association has been around for, I think, 80 some odd years out of Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the problem is not getting resolved. And in fact, you can make a case for it's getting worse in terms of the strains and different species in the past. First of all, you want one of your health department staff, Emily Holman, has done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every year she'd come out and do the presentation. We didn't have it this year. And as you know, we've we've had a West Nile death in the fourth District. So it's something very important to us. I guess. My question is, since the vector control district didn't go through, what is plan B or were you describing it earlier'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or what is the plan for the future without that in place?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So as a as I indicated, we we pay for vector control out of our realignment funding. The realignment funding has been a fairly stable resource in the last since I've been there in the last five or six years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But prior to that had gone down, you know, based on the economy. So that so basically for vector services, that is our funding source. We're doing our best to keep it stable. But as, as we see increases in, um, in different diseases and different types of mosquitoes and other vector borne diseases, I do have concern that we'",
        "'speaker_11': 'will not be able to keep up with the capacity given the funding source that it utilizes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you for that. And so I would just suggest that we we need to. Look at other sources for this and and not let this fall to, you know, not a top priority. It needs to be a top priority, in my view, all the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll move on to public works and thank you, Craig Vick, for mentioning our neighborhood associations. Wesker and AOC seven West is 100% in the fourth District and AOC seven. I think I have one or two streets of that organization, but it's interesting that they're adjacent to one another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For those who don't know, AOC seven is Anaheim Orange, a seventh street and. Jerry and Wesker is buried. Think about this area, how huge it is and dense on the north. It's PCH on the east, Redondo on the south 10th street and on the West Cherry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A huge area. They do a monthly cleanup. Our office provides a dumpster and we're more than happy to do that. And if anyone else would like to form a similar organization, we'd sure support that. And to to public works, I would assume you would just support more groups like that organized organizing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just want to get the okay on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, absolutely. The more that neighborhoods take control of their own areas, the better we see a reduction in illegal dumping.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the other piece is, I think the clean team, it's a great concept because we'll have one street or one alley or a certain section of the district that seems to be chronic. And so, you know, regular visits by them, you know, these groups collect so much and trash because they they do it once a month and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're very happy for that. But most of these areas, I think we could do it more often and certainly expand it. Also want to thank you for mentioning the Stearns Park Community Center Roof. And and it is fixed now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope so, because Mayor Garcia is going to be there on Saturdays. So we don't want it collapsing on him, if at all possible. But you had many no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Worries of a collapse. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember But you had mentioned the the maintenance issue there or the lack thereof and just sort RINO's. Craig Beck inherited this issue as did I, but I think in real numbers it's important to point out that for lack of doing a roof repair or let's say a roof job, I have no idea what that number is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's say it would definitely be under $50,000 to fix the roof. The entire repair was 1.4 million. Is that number right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the ballpark, yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So it really behooves us to to do that ongoing maintenance to that point, have you developed a program? Obviously one I guess didn't exist before your time, but but what are we doing moving forward?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks for the question. A couple of things. Partly through measure A, some measure did fund a reroof program. There was $1,000,000 committed to doing roofing. Many of that many of those dollars went towards our libraries and our fire stations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then secondarily, the facility condition assessment that we're currently underway and will complete here in another few months. One of the most important aspects of that is identifying where we have further roof challenges and we'll be prioritizing dollars towards the roofs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, we want to make sure that we can stop the leaking and if in fact, that's existing in a building and then we go from there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And speaking of water, I think you were leaking. ROSE But you also inherited the the the medians from Parks and Rec recently. And that's a major challenge for us, is just getting the medians watered. We've had this discussion many times, but I just want to say it publicly that we were we weren't watering medians by state'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mandates. So we're going to look at ways to to get that going again. One of the key areas in my district is the traffic circle, and no one ever said anything about it to me until the grass died.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we heard from a lot of folks who didn't like that look. I think I'll. I had a couple other notes here. I'm going to, for brevity, move on to development services. I just like to say we have some tremendous personnel there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to say publicly what Oscar Orsi has meant to community hospital. He's just done a tremendous job and he I don't think he's been recognized publicly. So I'd like to say that now. Christopher Coons. I don't think we've ever thrown a question at him that he hasn't answered, and very often it's directly with a constituent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is very much appreciated. I guess the one area where I would like to see us move forward on and that would be communication to the council offices. I think I said the certain thing year after year, but I consider it stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if there's a new development or something in our district, a boy, be great to know whether it's a new restaurant and at the time it comes to the planner. We'd love as much information as possible on that so we can promote that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's all I have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, fine. I'm going to wake up everyone because I'm going to devote my 38 minutes to Rex. Okay. All right. Well, I'll move on. First of all, I'm going to deal with public works, and that is Mr. Beck.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, he says, I want to thank you and all your employees for all the hard work you do. You know your department does, especially I want to thank all the people who work in the refuge department. You know, the Transportation Mobile bill does an amazing job.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What they have and what they have known to have gone back and forth on the traffic control and and the and pedestrian safety. And I'm impressed that the seven and eight traffics, you know, safety and park and investigation has been completed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Moving on. I would like to say I would really like you and your team to be focused on the consistency process and the criteria to improve traffic calmness measures across the city. These are various plans out there. And the right plan is, you know, we call it the Verizon zero among those others.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There have been many ways to implement them and to keep them up this year. So I would like for you to continue to do a great job that you have been doing on the street. So I'm looking forward to meeting with you individually to determine if there are additional resources that this body can allocate to help you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with. So I have no really no big questions. I just want to kind of thank you, Mr. Beck, because I heard that once and. MLK that you're going to do Hill Street. That has been I am almost 90 years old and that street is just not being talked about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I heard that is on the horizon for the next month or so. It is a thank you very much. I just look good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Richards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not through. Okay. I got 38 minutes. Go ahead. I'm use all of my 38 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get 38 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm good. Okay. And Mrs. Tatum, I want to thank you and your employees for the hard work you and your department does. You know, they are very, you know, courageous in and promptness in their response. And I really must say that because, you know, when we talk about code enforcement and other things, you guys are there because'",
        "'speaker_8': 'you really help my district, because you guys realize the situation that we're in over there. And I really want to thank you guys very, very much for being so prompt and responsive and the things that you do. I'm very proud that you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Included disability disposition and a department agreement for, you know, Libya. That's a link. And they have a Habitat for Humanity in the budget work that your department accomplishment and all these projects have broken ground in the district. And I know that it would wouldn't have not happened if it was possible without your help.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Mr. Patrick Ewing and Chris Coons and yourself. And you guys are doing a great job. If you look around the sixth District opening up three, we put the shovel in the ground with three projects. And that's saying something, you guys, because the fact that we're going to be able to help, you know, eliminate some of this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'homeless situation that we have. I'm just telling the other district, get busy, get busy because we got a big job to do. And thank you guys so much for being there for us. I also want to applaud you and your house in the neighborhood serve as well on the Neighborhood Leadership Program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This program really educates our residents on how the city works and empowered them to advocate for their neighborhoods. And I'm excited for the graduation this Saturday. And think everyone of you guys. And the last but not least, I'm going to deal with Health and Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I do have a pet peeve with that situation because the fact that the department at many of our top priorities, under their care and for the many districts in the hot topics are all covered and you're focused on 2020.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I looking forward to continue conversation and making our homeless coordination an extreme system and then making it stronger, especially increased increase in our engagement on the youth and keeping our community healthy. One of my biggest pet peeves, and after listening to it tonight was our earlier that believe that we could be stronger in our language access program'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I don't speak Spanish fluently, but I realize what the lady was saying tonight when she talks about paying a bill and not being able to have someone to be able to dare to translate that word, because if you don't pay your bills, they're going to cut something out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these individuals do have a family. And I was very, very saddened. And to me that we're not able to be able to do something about that. So we got to put more money into it and make sure and I don't believe that we yet have, you know, streamlined this system to our non English speaking residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And can we do a get this information that they need or to interact with that city in a way that can equal to English speakers? I'm very happy that our language coordinators is being made full time, but I worry that maybe this not be insufficient.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and she the goals of providing an equal service to all of our residents. And I'm wondering if there is more that we could do in partnership with community based organizations and other innovative means to leverage the investment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I told you I could do it. Less than five. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Unfortunately, the later it gets, the slower I speak. I'll do my best. So first of all, these three departments, I think it's very appropriate that they are presenting together. I think of planning as sort of what's the long term game and how do we think about think long term public works is implementation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'How do we get them the resources they need to implement the things that we need? And then health is really quality of life. We all talk about quality of life and what that means. We're fortunate to have our health department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And to think from a health lens on the decisions we make. So all three of your departments are incredibly important to doing our job as a city in providing quality, quality public services. In terms of I'll start with planning long range stuff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you certainly have a lot going on. So we won't reiterate a lot of that. You know, the city wide stuff I think has been covered. So I'm just going to touch on just a couple of things that that I can speak to congratulate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think, you know, I can't say enough about Oscar and Christopher Koontz. You've got some great lieutenants within your department. I think the work that took place in Grant Neighborhood this year was was incredible. It meant a lot to place that focus on sort of the historic nature in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was great to get an update on the Vacant Lot program. I think the next step is to really make that connection to economic development because we wanted to register them, but ultimately we wanted to encourage them to make plans for these vacant lots that have sat vacant across town.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think we need to make sure in this next fiscal year, we we make that connection between the vacant lot registry and economic development. The Neighborhood Leadership Program is a great program. We've heard a few good things about a plan, and you and I had a conversation about a plan today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's important that we, you know, make sure we intersect a plan with some of the amazing work public works has going and and that we do a better job really lifting up you know, destination uptown right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's what this is is we've never had this amount of planning attention in Uptown before. And I want to make sure we get this right and that the residents understand how significant of an effort this is. And I know that we have we have a you know, we have we're in agreement on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think, you know, just in general, when we refer to the shelter, we need to start referred to it as bridge housing. Right. We need to be disciplined, planning, health and all of us and referring to this appropriately as bridge housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I myself will help hold folks accountable to to adopting that, because that's essentially what this is. This is a bridge. It's a gateway to other services, a gateway to getting people out of homelessness. That's what that's what it is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, Mr. Koonce has given a lot of I want to make sure that it's important that we know that he has the flexibility to help with this arena process moving forward. It's incredibly important. We're rounding the bend on methodology.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're getting more and more involved in this gang. And when we come out of the arena process, there's a big conversation on what happens beyond arena, and we have a role as a major city to help shape that process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In fact, due to advocacy of, you know, some of the Big Ten mayors and others, you know, there's a there's a grant program that skegg. $50 million that we can help shape to help cities do what's next. And so I want to make sure that that you and Christopher are being proactive while we have a seat at'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the table and helping to shape what will be helpful to Long Beach from our position and what can help get other cities cranking on this regional housing issue because it is an issue for Long Beach and we can help shape that $50 million program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's essentially my comments. I didn't really have any questions for you. Linda is the easy ones. You know, it was move on public works. Just some feedback. So first of all, I know you're doing an amazing job with the limited resources you have and you keep getting more and more responsibilities placed on you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we need to think about the name of the Daisy Bike Boulevard I've heard of as the Daisy Myrtle. I've heard that the Daisy Linden Myrtle. It's a north south bike boulevard. I think we can make a better name for that, because I had a hard time even understanding when I thought Daisy Avenue was few different'",
        "'speaker_9': ', but it's been referred to differently. It's a great project. You know, me and councilman in Austin went on a ride with you, and it's a great project. And I think we need to embrace these these newer sites, so we need to brand it a little bit better.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Artesia Boulevard is something that is always in the conversation with ninth District because only touches the ninth District. Right. So folks may get tired of hearing of it, but hearing about it. But we're the only ones are going to pick up and lift up Artesia because it only touches it's a 91 freeway, essentially only touches the ninth'",
        "'speaker_9': 'district. And you've done a pretty good job at effect at sort of linking different agencies to lift up how important it is to the region and has been a successful strategy. So, you know, with Skaggs support with the colleagues support with the city strategy, MSR sees support with active transportation stuff and Metro strategy with the great Artesia'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Boulevard Project. We have something special that's going to begin to take shape this year and so on, to make sure that we are intentional about using this opportunity to address whatever we can address Artesia Boulevard, including undergrounding those utility lines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will probably not touch Artesia again for another 25 years. So while we have an opportunity, we have to, like early on, embrace this conversation about utility lines. And I know we talk about that, but I think it's important enough for us to lift it up because this is our, you know, one time year to do that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'out in park. I see it here. I know it's a difficult project. We know once you crack open a near 100 year old building, you're going to find things. And, you know, and this has been you know, we've had to sacrifice over the last, you know, really nine years and focus on assembling that funding over years to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'be in this project. And we knew we had $7 million to begin. This could potentially be more. So thank you for really taking on this tough project, finding the issues to, you know, finding out how to address these issues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So my question here on out in part is what do we see as the you know, given the action tonight and what we're doing, the budget, what do you see as the anticipated completion of this phase of Highland Park?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, if all goes well, Councilmember, we hope to be done in November.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. All right. And I know that that means you always give yourself a couple of months of cushion. So that's a good sign. November. I know they want a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Couple months of cushion, but certainly we hope to be done in November. And if all goes well, we we will be having a celebration in that month.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Fantastic. And it's again, Highland Park is important. We've made sacrifices. There are five city halls closer to to Highland Park in my district than our own city hall. So to many people, that is our civic center in uptown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, it's it's you know, it's got a North health facility that you, you know, you and Kelly have partnered on and have a really good plan. So it's incredibly important. And I'm looking forward to closing that chapter for now so we can focus on many of the other priorities that we have in Uptown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's hard to go to the community, say, unfortunately, the next few years we can't focus on playgrounds, we can't focus on this and on that because we have this massive project of 100 year old community center to make safe.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so thank you for that. So I'm going to move on now to health. I'll start with, you know, there's a really there's some some dynamic synergy going on with Kelly and Teresa Chandler and even Diana Tang and and the mayor's efforts in the state led efforts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, I'm noticing the money that you guys are pulling down on homelessness. It should be recognized and we should be encouraged. And you are doing so much work, everyone's lifted that up. And I think everyone's made a strong point that we should be supporting it because every dollar we invest in the health department is leveraged, you'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know, nine times, 97 times 50 at least. So we have to continue to do that. And while it might be tempting to go to you and talk about efficiencies, the reality is you are the most efficient department. You have consistently been the most efficient department for many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we want to continue to reward that efficiency. I lift up a couple of things. It's great to see you're going to be taking on the youth strategic plan. It's great that you guys closed out the Veterans Strategic Plan in this past year, and we gave one times to help with the printing from our our office'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to help make sure that happens. So that's fantastic. I know we have a lot of workout work cut out for us on Bridge on the Bridge housing project in North Long Beach. We're not there yet. I don't want you know, I think we should all just be realistic that we still have a lot of work to do'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in terms of the multidisciplinary approach and having all the cities on the same page to make sure that there's the commitment we made publicly to really join hands and push this project. We have to follow that through. And it's going to we're going to have to color outside the lines a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know that this is going to intersect what you're doing, what Linda is doing, what economic development is doing. But we have to get it right. It's on us to just get on each other's nerves early and figure this out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we look back on this and this is something that that we can really be proud of, because it's important to all of the work that we're doing in the city around homelessness, sort of. The next thing is the homeless incentive program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We, you know, we came to council and talked about helping to find funding and other we identified some county funding for the in the housing authority, the incentive program. But when we came to council and talked about that, we also talked about the source of income discrimination policy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do you have an update on where and this is the policy that essentially said you can't outright just say no Section eight in your advertisements and source of income. We should be neutral. Do you know where you are with that policy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So we've we pulled from the county's language to the county recently passed a similar ordinance we have pulled that we think it's a really strong that the language is appropriate and makes a lot of sense for the for the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that is currently sitting with the city attorney to draft to draft the ordinance. And we're bringing that forward to you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. All right, great. You have an idea on a timeline where we can get that back. I just want to close this issue out. Thank you. So next, you know, Councilman Superhot brought up the vector control in my district, about 40% in the Compton Creek Mosquito Abatement District.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we get a question and there's dedicated staff and they do outreach and we see that. And I was, you know, disappointed to see what happened with the Vector District. But at the same time, I didn't see much of an education campaign around it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know that people fully understood what the stakes were and how this understand this helps our ability to respond. What went into the education campaign around this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Given that it was prop to 18? Um, we were, uh, we were instructed that, that the, a strong education campaign could look more as an advocacy campaign. And so in those cases we were able to, through our, um, through the, the information that went out, you know, with the original survey and then went out with the ballot'",
        "'speaker_11': 'itself, had a lot of information to it. Um, if we were in community meetings or, and people talked with us, we would share with them what the, what the issues were. But we did not produce materials.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Just just some feedback. When it came up that this was an idea, I think it was already too late. I think we have to have an ongoing education campaign around the issue so that when this does come up and it's time to go silent on the issue, we've already helped shape the message.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know, you know, Monday morning quarterbacking is hard to look back at what we did wrong. But I think I think it is important, even though 40% of my district's in a basement district, I do see the difference.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's important. And we need to we need to maintain a focus on that. I want to move to language access. You know, this is a general statement. It's not really directed at you, Ms.. Collopy, but having served as chief of staff for four years and then been on council for five, I'm tired of this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It being the main, main issue of council. At some point staff has to just own this and say this is a part of what we do. This is a part of our service philosophy. The Council, many councils reaffirm this so we can move on other things, I think, between now and the next and I don't want to'",
