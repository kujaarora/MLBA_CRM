        "'speaker_3': 'And when I think about any city thinking about joining Clean Power Alliance, I understand they're signing up for this legal entity. But I also really want to stress that folks are considering signing up to support these values. And that's that's unique.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think these statements of values are really important in any consideration because they span the gamut of sustainability, not just environmental stuff, but clearly local economic development, equity considerations as well as environmental progress.

        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Let me if you could just go to my last slide and I will summarize. That. That CPA sort of JPA structure is a lower risk option for cities. We are very focused on keeping our jobs and economic benefits to stay within the region.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for that. Let me go back to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much for sharing with everyone today. I know that when we first started talking about CCS, you guys were just getting started. And so it's great to see the success that you've gotten so far. 30 cities is no small feat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you could, I know that you weren't able to show that slide, but I'd like to ask just one question. There was one about opt outs. I think it was two slides back. You skipped over it. If. If the staff could slide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One more. There you go. Now go back to the graph. Thank you. Let's take a look at this since you didn't get a chance to mention it. What's the highest opt out rate that you have?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Our highest opt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Out rate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is generally concentrated in Ventura County with very low opt out rate in Los Angeles. That's the first thing I will note for Los Angeles County. The second thing I'll note is that opt outs tend across the spectrum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be driven more by either media attention.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or political.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Leanings in the city and not so much by price. You know, if you look at our 100% green default cities in L.A. County at the residential level of a 4.7% opt out rates. Similarly, there's less than one percentage point higher than.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the clean power default rate. So what I think by the point I would make here is, is back to this point that this default is probably one of the major or is one of the major policy tools that we offer our member agencies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every member agency gets to, if they join, gets to choose what the default is. And, you know, if you were to choose a 100% green power default, for example, yes, it would come at a cost premium. You'd also be pretty much overnight the largest city in the country to serve your residents with 100% renewable energy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you for that. And then I have one other question for you. How many do you have? 30 seats on the board because there's 30 cities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, we have 32 seats on the board because we're 30 cities and two unincorporated county jurisdictions. So L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ventura County.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And 30 cities within those two counties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what's the largest? How many ratepayers are there with L.A. County?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just around 250,000. Long Beach would be the second largest city and our second largest jurisdiction in our GTA. Currently the second largest is Castle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And my last question before we hear from other council members is I know the the next item talks about the need if we went with the word to have hydro electricity. And that's something that CPA have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So we what we do is we tend to focus on renewables and new build renewables, because we're very much trying to exceed state mandates and put ratepayer dollars back into the development of new renewable energy in order to keep our carbon content low.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we have a mandate by our EPA to keep it lower than than Southern California Edison. We buy existing large hydro power resources in order to reduce our carbon footprint even further.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I might I have one more question. I'm trying to talk really fast because we also only get 5 minutes. Which unions do you guys have project labor agreements with?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So most of our projects have five trade agreements. So it's typically IBEW, ironworkers, carpenters, laborers, and I'm spacing on the fourth. I'm on the fifth. I apologize, but it's it's IBEW laborers, carpenters and our workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And are those jobs all created in L.A. County, California or other states?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The of the 1500 we have, about 1350 are in the state of California. And a smaller subset of that is in L.A. L.A. County is an expensive place to do business in general, and particularly for our large scale projects.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have two major projects in L.A. County, and the rest is in southern and central California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, I have other questions, but I will see if my council calls, have thoughts. But I appreciate the effort and the presentation today is very insightful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there any of the other council members who'd like to speak on this item?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, madam, this is Councilman. And I did keep up, but I don't know what would happen. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you very much, Ted, for this. For then I think that, you know, having this in front, in front and sharing it with the community is very important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that this is new territory for us as a city, and the more that we are able to have it detailed and broken down into, you know, so to help the community also understand is is very important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to say that thank you. Thank you very much for your detailed presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure if the system is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I don't think it is cute as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Mr. Pataki, thanks for this presentation. If requested a copy of this, but if you're unable to get it, certainly a part of the program. It's a big decision. I'd love to learn a little bit more, certainly about what this means, particularly the screen we're looking at, opt out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you mind spending a little bit of time in the chair with me? What exactly they opted out of? And, you know, I think a big part of understanding, you know, if people want to stay with what they have with that, that would be walk me through this opt out piece.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. So the state legislation that enabled this case that was passed in 2022 made it what they call an automatic default program. That is when a city joins a SCCA or forms a SCCA. When that car starts service, the the assumption and the operating principle is that every every electricity customer would be defaulted into the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being a CCR customer. Now, in practice, what that means is that we send out we do a lot of public outreach, we send out notices before people are defaulted into the system as well as after. And they are given the ability to say, no, I'm not interested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to go back and quote unquote go back, but I would like to remain a bundled customer, which is mean. I'm getting my electricity and my transmission and distribution from from SC in this case. So really what this is, is how you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And people can do that at any time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They could also change their rates if you defaulted in at 100% green power or clean power and people really wanted to save money, they could put a top down and to a money saving tier. So it is an opt in program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We ask people, we inform.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then they need to affirmatively opt out. If they do nothing, they are automatically become our customers and they're automatically put on the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The CB chose as its default. Right. That's why we're in this we're in this default. I'm going to say it's the number one sort of confusion at that at launch. But, you know, we we get through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. And, you know, I have other questions that they'll be from staff later. And the question that I have for you is, given the fact that we'd be the largest if we opt to move forward with the largest, does that open up playbook, if you will, in terms of offering more creative programs that, you know, maybe maybe'",
        "'speaker_1': 'targeted to achieve our goals the city sets forward like what is great for us, does it us the ability to to change what is going here and present and that may be superior.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So there's you know, I'll say that formally, we are a one jurisdiction, one member agency, one vote, a governance structure. But in practice, you kind of you get what you give. And the cities that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are active, that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have some expertize, that have staff on the ground ready to propose and shape programs, get in practice, have a greater voice in the decision making because that's just who's putting the time and the energy into it. So while I will say that, you know, hopefully there's only a one vote per member and I don't see that changing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any time soon, how that voice and vote gets exercised. Our larger agencies. So is that because they've got the time and the energy and resources to dedicate to it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman, that concludes your questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now. Fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. What is the amount of renewable energy we currently get through Southern California Edison, for comparison's sake?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if there's there's no coal, it's mostly natural gas. Large hydro and nuclear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Councilmember, we'll get to that when we get to the staff presentation will be able to give a little bit of that comparison.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. And then then I have other questions for staff at that time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there is there a public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. There is public comment on this item.'",

It is abundantly clear that joining clean power lines when the easiest and most effective way to transition will be towards 100% renewable energy system as outlined in the DCC Usability Report.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Joining Pintar Alliance means that Long Beach could provide competitive grants to Southern California Edison while providing clean, renewable energy to all of its citizens. As I've mentioned before, the Power Alliance offers a 36% renewable option, which is 1 to 2% cheaper than Edison, facing a 50% renewable option, which crosses James Edison and the 100% renewable energy option'",

It's a mean even if residents chose not to have 100% renewable energy, they would still be paying less or the same for cleaner energy.

We also have our three department directors who have substantial experience in this area and have provided a recommendation. So we want to make sure that you really understand this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is one of the more complex things that a local government can do. You know, for example, you'll hear in the presentation, if we go down this path, we would be purchasing power up to about $150 million a year, and you do that in long term contracts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this would be over $1,000,000,000 over a ten year period that we would be getting into a new market that we're not currently in. So we do want you to really understand the pros and the cons and the risks and all the timelines.'",

        "'speaker_9': '100% renewable. And if you looked at the lowest priced option, you'd be talking about a 1%, maybe a 2% savings compared to the current SCC bills. The Long Beach rates would not be competitive for large industrial users, including the city, so those customers could remain with AC if the city did opt in with the 100% renewable option'",
        "'speaker_9': 'with Clean Power Alliance, we would expect that our costs in our budget would need to increase by about $1.7 million a year. We wanted to very briefly and I'll go over these price costs and comparisons quickly. Look at the options that Ted talked about with the CPA lean option.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's the lowest price compared to what you currently would be paying with AC in general, you'd save about 1%. Large businesses would see a cost increase of about 9%. Renewable energy would look better, but not by much. We'd go from 35% renewable to 36, and greenhouse gas emissions would be much higher.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that has to do with the fact that there's a lot of hydro and nuclear in this portfolio. If you went to a clean option from CPR and compared it to the SCA base rate, they would be generally at the moment, no cost difference.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Large businesses would see a price increase, but there would be benefits in terms of renewable energy content and greenhouse gas emissions. If you compared the clean energy option to the CC alternative, which is 50% clean energy, you would still save about 1.6%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But SC does better than CPA in terms of renewable knowable energy, and SC does better than greenhouse gas, better than CPA and greenhouse gas emissions with the most green option of CPA called the green option again compared to the SC SC base.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I Going back to what I said earlier, you'd see resident bills about 8 to 9% higher. Large businesses would see an increase of about 17%. But you'd get much better renewable energy content and your greenhouse gas emissions would go down to zero if you compared that CPA green energy option to the SC e's green option, the 100%'",
        "'speaker_9': 'option CPA is higher. All the other factors would I'm sorry, the residents bills would be higher for CPA, but all the other factors would be just about equal. So moving on to job creation, job creation, another key item, we think that the study shows that job creation would be very modest at best if we did a standalone'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city, C K, meaning we created one from scratch. It would be like that of any small company. It would have the economic benefits of a small company, 10 to 27 jobs. If we talked about joining a Joint Powers Authority such as the CPA, a Clean Power Alliance, there would be no economic impact because there would be no'",
        "'speaker_9': 'jobs created in Long Beach. Overall, there may be economic impact if the prices to our residents and businesses are higher or lower, but we don't have enough information on that to say whether if the prices are higher, you'd have a negative economic impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If prices are lower, you'd have a positive impact. And what we're saying is it's going to be a very uncertain situation. Governance. And we've heard about governance and we've talked about that there needs to be a decision as to the governance method.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The key ones being a standalone CCE where the city created one, are joining a Joint Powers Authority like Clean Power Alliance. You could also form one. That's probably not as likely. Each one of those has their positive and negative aspects having to do with what's the level of local control, what's the level of risk, what's the startup'",
        "'speaker_9': 'costs there? There are a number of factors. We recommend a detailed analysis be done before that decision is made. We also think that there's a lack of public awareness. Most residents don't know what a CCAR is or they've heard nothing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it's going to lower costs or it's going to make major greenhouse gas inroads. That may or may not be the case. And we think that residents really should be informed about that before council makes a decision so they can hear from residents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've talked a lot about risks and uncertainties. We wanted to go over some of the key ones, and I'm going to quickly go through them where you see in the bottom right, a key uncertainty that is evolving. You will see that that particular risk is something that we think deserves where we think that council would be important'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to consider, whether it's appropriate to make a decision now or wait till these risks and uncertainties stabilize. The first one is about resource adequacy. This is a technical requirement that all suppliers of electricity have to have adequate power resources available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is a changing field and we believe that there are potential significant cost implications for CCAR as these regulations continue to develop and we expect significant changes there and we don't know how that's going to come out. That's key area one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The next one is the exit fee. This has to do with the fact that when a customer leaves Southern, California, Edison, Southern or any investor owned utility, they in Southern California, Edison has invested in long term contracts. There is a cost to break that contract for that customer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those costs are charged to the CCJ. And again, that methodology is evolving as we speak. We expect significant changes and we don't know how that's going to impact CA's ability to provide services and costs in the future. Rates charged higher than AC rates that those are risks we've talked about that it's it's just they risk a lack'",
        "'speaker_9': 'of public engagement. We've talked about that that we're concerned that the customers, if they pay seven or 8% higher rates, may not be happy with that. And as was pointed out, most customers do not opt out and they could be some significant unhappiness.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is an uncertainty. The volatile electric market is very volatile. That's that's not that's just a fact. And there are risks associated with that. Customers opting out of the car and returning to Southern California Edison, which Clean Power Alliance talked about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are enough of those there are risks associated with that, associated with the costs that could be charged unfavorable legislative and regulatory changes. We think that's a key uncertainty. Again, that's evolving. We there is constant legislation. There's constant regulatory issues in the electric market.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We think that it would be best to wait until there's some stability there. Increased costs for the city's own electricity costs, we think that's maybe not so much a risk, but more of a fact. But nonetheless, we've listed that as a risk.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Withdrawal from the Clean Power Alliance is a risk. We we as far as we know, if we went started to go with CPA and for some reason, before they started providing electricity, got out, there might be some costs potentially in the millions of dollars there that needs to be explored more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A nonperformance of counterparties. You buy electricity, you create buy something from a contractor who puts in a new solar system or a new wind farm someplace. And there's a failure. There are risks associated with that. Increased opportunity to direct access.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Direct access is legislation which allows big customers to purchase their electricity from a third party supplier of their choice. That legislation is potentially changing. It is a risk. We don't think it's as great. I haven't marked as a key uncertainty, but we don't believe that major customers are likely to join the a k anyway, so probably not'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that big of an item. Changes to operation of a statewide electrical grid. Obviously there are problems with the California's electricity electrical transmission grid. It needs to evolve. That also is a key uncertainty because it's evolving and could change control and competitiveness.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To wrap things up on risk, we thought it was important to quote the Public Utility Commission and their view that it is an uncertain market and this is their comments and quotes from them on November 19th saying there is uncertainty in the California electrical market and there are regulations that are are changing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what our point of this is and part of our recommendations is that we have an uncertain and evolving market and regulatory environment. It could well affect the rates, whether it's savings or costs. It could affect the level of greenhouse gas emissions or the weather.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's clean. And that is a key reason why we're recommending caution. Let's talk to the mechanics, general timeline. And this timeline is, in fact, driven by legislative requirements. But by the end of a calendar year, it doesn't have to be this year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But by the end of any calendar year, that's when you look at what's the public support. You make major decisions and you file with the state and intent to form 8-K the following year. Assuming everything goes right, you begin the process of ramping up that organization or if it's an existing JPA entering into contracts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you spend the next year setting things up and then the year after that, after final verifications, you begin operations. If we in fact join the CPA Clean Power Alliance in 2020, the time frame is more or less the same, except we're now near the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we would file a letter of interest with Clean Power Alliance. We would pay a fee so that they could study whether it's appropriate, in their opinion, for that Long Beach to join. By the end of the year, we would make a decision as to whether to do that or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then CPA would submit the implementation plan to the state by the end of the calendar year. But they would do it as opposed to us having done it in 2021, CPA would enter into contracts and in 2022 we'd begin operations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our conclusions are and the conclusion of the study, as you might imagine, is that this is in fact feasible and but it is so uncertain that desired benefits would be achieved. And it brings economic risk to our residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They could see higher bills. The greenhouse gas emissions may not be that much different than remaining with SC, SC and the financial projections are uncertain, and we think that making a decision at a later date would serve the city well and allow a decision with less uncertainty as to benefit, benefit and costs, and would also provide a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'better opportunity to inform the public and gauge their level of support that gets to our recommended actions, which is deferred to defer consideration of creation of a CCE because it's a major financial and operational decision in an uncertain market for up to two years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'B less than that of stability occurs. We think that we would monitor the California energy market and regulatory environment and report back to council if there is a material change. This recommendation is not that there's something wrong with the CCE or that we shouldn't do it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's just that the risk of of things not working out as expected is too high at this point. So studying it and reporting back is our recommendation. We think that we need to look at the pros and cons of the governance model and provide a recommendation to council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is it better to form our own CCR? Is it better to join an existing JPA? And that study can be done independent of whether we should do either. On finally conducting a balanced community outreach to reach to increase care where awareness and get input back from the residents and businesses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And finally, we think it's really important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Partner with CCE to provide. They are providing a lot of green energy options. It is not as well known as it should be. And we think if we partner with SCC, we might be able to make significant inroads in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and becoming more renewable with the options that he has.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That in essence is a summary of the study and our recommendation. We do have Mark Fulmer on the phone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's going to cue individuals to come in so that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He is available to speak with us, if you would like, on the study. And we also have Mike, Mary Ali from Southern California Edison, who can talk about the options that Southern California Edison has, if you're interested. And with that, we conclude the study and we're available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you. Mr. GROSS. This is Tom Modica, city manager again. So I just wanted to sum up, had you heard a lot of information very quickly, we can stand by and answer questions. I kind of wanted to give a little perspective from my chair, city manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There clearly are some benefits. I think we're all in favor of, you know, improving our climate and looking for ways to get additional green power. And a lot of that is happening in California. But in terms of ACA, there's some benefits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's also some substantial risk that we went through with you today. We do believe that there are going to be cost impacts not only to the city of Long Beach of about 1.7 million, but also to our residents in a pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the council has been really focused on trying to to keep costs as low as possible. This is a highly complex area, and it is going to require a substantial diversion of staff. If we go down this route, we would want to make sure we do this right and that we really dedicate key people to making sure'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we know how this is going to play out. We're also going to need some financial resources as we move in this area. If we go this route and we're in the middle of a $30 million shortfall while we're also trying to address the pandemic, and we also just approved 26 furlough days for our management team, and we'll'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be doing that for other employees as well. All this while the market continues to change. And so that really is the basis of our recommendation to you is given the magnitude of a decision like this could very well might be in our future at some point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we're asking you is, you know, given the totality of the of the circumstances that we're faced with, that we really spend some time to better understand this, to further look at some of the governance models and and not to enter into kind of an agreement by the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I will turn it back to the Council for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. America. Let me go ahead and go to the council. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clay, can you talk?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Mr. Mayor, and I really appreciate the city manager's comments. I think he summarized what some of us were thinking during the presentation pretty well. I think words like risk and significant impact are very relevant right now, and so I really appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to hear from see if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good afternoon. Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the council. I'm Mike Morelli, the vice president of the business customer division for Southern California Edison. So I really appreciate you spending the time to digest these issues, and I'm certainly here to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do not have a prepared presentation. I do have to let you know that for customer community choice aggregation, we do operate under a code of conduct where Southern California Edison has the obligation to remain neutral. But I am certainly able to answer any questions you may have on the mechanics and, you know, the what what role'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we do or don't do, whether you choose. C.K. But I think Ted did a really good job kind of summarizing those aspects of it. But please let me know if there's any specific questions you'd have out for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, sure. So, I mean, I don't know how many of my council colleagues have the opportunity to have a briefing with your team. I know I did. And they provided me an overview of some of the current efforts in regards to clean energy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perhaps you can touch on those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So as the staff presentation outlined, we are currently at 35% renewable and about 50% carbon free. And, you know, it's state law. So all providers are working down to the ultimate 2045 carbon free power. I think the the other information that we have available is that and I think even Ted summarized it in his presentation, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, quite frankly, we're we're pretty aligned on where we want to work, what we're trying to do at Southern California Edison around greenhouse gas reductions. And so we've put out a white paper about a year ago called Pathway 2045.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that pathway basically says, you know, we need to get to a carbon free grid and then we need to use that grid to electrify additional end to end uses such as transportation, electrification, space and water heating to really support the state's goals for for GHG significant GHG reductions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we are we are committed to that. We recognize that our customers need to be part of that journey. And so we have a lot of programs that we're putting in place to support that pathway vision, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So electric transportation, we have we have we've had a ton of success working with the city and various departments around energy efficiency for many, many years. The port we work with extensively on electrification efforts as well as some training opportunities with the college and all those programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are those are all outside of the power procurement role, if you will, of a community choice aggregation situation. We have been talking with Mr. Gardiner about maybe a more formal way of of aligning our partnership with the with the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we have a, you know, a proposed framework that we were we are certainly interested in trying to put in place again around how we can both go down this this pathway, if you will, to 2045 and significant carbon reductions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Thank you. I know I've probably exceeded my time, so I'm going to turn it back to the mayor to have my other colleagues talk as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Yeah, that was a different presentation than was queued up in December. Obviously a lot of talk about risk and I want to get to that. But I also want to recognize that we're here today for a couple of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're here today because this council unanimously decided to do this study to see if it was feasible to go down the pathway of community choice energy. We're also here today because we know that we've got state mandates and we are also here because in our climate adaptation action plan as a draft form right now, we do not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have a path to reach those goals. It's important not just to have goals at the state level, but to have a method to be able to reach those goals quickly. And I think that the presentation that was presented by TED demonstrates that I can do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to recognize that we are in a critical moment in history as this Council has been tackling with COVID. We've also been tackling the structural racism that exists in the city and across the US. So when I consider the vote that needs to be taken tonight, I consider the questions of what risk is worth human'",
        "'speaker_2': 'life, what risk is worth making sure that we are providing clean energy as quick as possible in a responsible, financially feasible way. And so I just want to ground us in some of those comments. I know that our mayor has signed the Compact of Mayors in 2015 to join the largest coalition of city governments to address climate'",
        "'speaker_2': 'change. We remain committed to the Paris Agreement, and we know that there are a lot of efforts going on in our city. I want to recognize that our cap plan, while it's not on the agenda tonight, I did do community outreach from 2018 to the current moment, and they received over 10,000 attendees in the CAP plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They have talked about the opportunity of a community choice energy. The CAP plan also demonstrates that in the city of Long Beach, 44% of our energy is from stationary energy. This is where residents, small businesses and large businesses will have the opportunity to really reduce their greenhouse gases.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason that that is so critically important is because of a recent study that came out by Harvard that said that one unit lower a greenhouse gases can calculate to 248 fewer people who have died in the city of New York of Koven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I say that because it's important to recognize that there are some differences in the in the study, and I would like to dove deeper into that. So I'm glad we have our additional staff here to help us with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I really want to ground the rest of the conversation and the fact that we have a health crisis on our hands. And part of it is because we have not taken risk to be able to move to clean energy faster.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that that is what we are talking about today. I also want to recognize that. The city itself has had a big interest in in oil. And I believe that this is one of those moments that we as a city have to really address, nor are we in business for are we in business for the residents that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pay taxes that we care for, that we are responsible to? Are we in business for a certain entity? So no disrespect to Edison at all, but recognizing that the city of Long Beach doesn't have a seat on the board of Edison, the city of Long Beach shouldn't have a financial interest in Edison, although we might have one'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And being able to allow our our residents to have a real choice is really important. So I'd like to first ask Mike, since you're here, how many people have opted in with 100% renewable energy with Edison from Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, it's very few. I don't have the specific number, but it's it's it's very few.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the number that was told to me by staff was around 130.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's probably about that seems right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I say that for my council colleagues to recognize that while Edison is here saying that they will provide us with a pathway and a partnership. Right now, we've already been doing this for two years, and that number hasn't changed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's reasons why that number hasn't changed. Right. Edison has been in operation for a very long time. And they have things that they're responsible for that are on their books that they need to take care of. I think first, probably the question is you mentioned that you're trying to put together a package for the city of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Long Beach. Is that a package that you would offer any other city and any other ratepayers?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The the framework that we're looking at is around how how to make sure we understand the city's goals and our goals and where that intersection is. We work with different communities in different ways. We do not have this framework agreement with any other city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, quite frankly, we're we're looking at seeing how how it works with potentially works with Long Beach. And then we may look to move that to other communities every year. And we've we've had other efforts. And quite frankly, I think where we're closer aligned with our communities than sometimes it may appear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think we're missing that overall view of how we're aligned. That's what we're attempting to address. I think, again, we've done a lot of great things with the with the city. And, you know, I hear your goals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know our goals, and there's a lot of commonality there. But, you know, sometimes it's a matter of of putting that into a document and understanding it and quite frankly, then working those issues where we are aligned. I should be clear in and you know, we want to work with the city regardless of if you choose to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'form a CCJ or not. That's not going to. That's not going to change whether or not we have this framework agreement. There may be different elements. If you're procuring the energy, then obviously the energy components probably wouldn't be of interest to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I should also mention that, yes, we have an existing green energy program. We have we're working on Evolve. We have some of that that's coming through that's going to be new programs very soon that will be in the market.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we're continuing to work on other programs again for all our bundled service customers that are that may be eligible to select that. The green energy program we have is an opt in. So there was a discussion about opt out, opt in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So our customers are served under our, you know, our base product, if you will, of the 35% renewable. And they have to affirmatively opt in to select the green program. So that that is a distinction on the CCR approach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that, Mike. And I definitely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Saw 5 minutes are up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I'll call you back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and do I do have a couple other councilmembers cued up. Let's go and do public comment and then we'll come back to the council. Now that we had the the first and Councilmember Price was at a motion to receive and filed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Initially, Mr. Mayor. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then Councilmember appears that a second to receive and file.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I actually have a motion that I had prepared. Councilmember Price, if you wouldn't mind, I tried to queue up first, but you beat me to it and let me read my motion and see if it's something that, as we call here, friendly receive in filed a report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'See, I'd like to ask some of these questions first, but receive and receive and follow the report file a letter of interest with Clean Power Alliance. Direct the city manager to prepare a study that analyzes government options, including forming a standalone the enterprise, creating new joint powers, JPA with other interested public agencies or joining an existing JPA'",
        "'speaker_2': 'include the team that is compiling the cap, along with the CPA team with our oil and gas department and direct staff to do monthly updates. Okay. So I think that's that's that's a very significant friendly. So I'm just going to go ahead and stick with my motion to receive and file and then it probably would be best'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or if you want to make the motion and include everything that that you want because I'm not prepared to make or support the motion that you just made, because you're right, there's a lot of things in there that probably haven't been asked about yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council here is claiming a success. And also I means that maybe I misunderstood, but I if this is a report, but I know that next item is item eight, which would be the request to create or join. And I think I don't know is that the, the, the appropriate place to build a motion or did you intend'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it should be on the on the report on the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be on the staff report. And I checked with the city attorney on it. The only thing that's substantive, it's different from what the staff report is. It's a letter of interest, which I'd like to be able to talk a little bit more before making that motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well. So then we have a we have a motion by councilmember. Our price. And then councilman Councilman Mongo is at a second or a receiving pile. No. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe, but I'm happy the second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So who will second? Who's who is the second?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since the 80 seconds that I just have a lot of questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well, why don't we do this? Let's go to public comment and I might come back to the Q. We actually have a lot of councilmembers. I want to speak also, and maybe they will answer some of the questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilor Pearce, you can chew up again, too, and go to those questions. So why don't we go and go to a public comment and then we'll go back to the council publicly.'",

I urge you to be very careful when you say you are going to direct the city manager to raise awareness of Edison's existing programs and renewable options. The law is clear that Edison is prohibited from doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my city council shouldn't either. Edison knows there is a code of conduct law, S.B. 790, that limits their participation in the process of Long Beach, studying whether or not to form the CCR or maybe join another one like Clean Power Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On those discussions, Edison has to stay out of it. I don't even know why they're on the call today. They know that, and I hope they are complying. What I'm not sure of is why on earth you would direct city staff to use our tax dollars to be Edison's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do their advertising for them. Please don't do that. We need Edison on our side when we form a CC because they will be our partner. We don't want to get off on the wrong foot with our future partner, so let's have everything out in the open, fair and square from the get go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead with all the city outreach and studying and monitoring. Just no delaying and certainly no advertising for Edison. However, I realize this might be falling on deaf ears because the feasibility study report you just heard. Sure sounds like an Edison commercial.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Changes in the city's electrical energy service are ongoing and will continue to be required to keep pace with the needs, including doing our part to meet the global challenge of climate change. However, it's vital that proposed changes and solutions be relatable in specific, measurable terms potential costs and benefits to the city's residents and benefit businesses.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And is this report riskier? The same amount of risk, or how would you determine this moment right now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now, right now, there's a lot of a bit more risk than was being considered three or four years ago. And that's due to changes mainly at the Public Utilities Commission on how they're treating certain costs as highlighted in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The cost to meet resource adequacy is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How quick is that cost? Is that cost similar for Edison resource adequacy?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is different. Edison has a fair amount of resources already under contract to provide those services, while a as would not have to purchase those on the market so they would be incurring higher costs than Edison would be in the short term for those kind of resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second is the CIA, which is now at historic highs, but it's volatile and will eventually go down. But it's a it's a big uncertainty with respect to what the costs in the short term would be. And so we'd concluded that it was feasible that some savings could be achieved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in the meantime, we adjusted some of the resource and some of the assumptions that looked a little bit closer to the high CIA case, as well as the high rate case. Those factors, it's close and be able to hear it on principle, be done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just requires sharpening the pencil a bit more before you can say, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the bottom line is it's it's not a slam dunk, but it's not a sit on the bench either, which I I'm sure you would like me to come up with a more definitive answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, that's what you said is exactly what I what I had hoped, which is sharpen the pencil. Right. That there's another layer of information that needs to be had. And when I read your report and I read Chapter ten conclusions, it says the top one is potentially financially feasible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you say Long Beach is two primary options are forming with the city only or joining CPA. So I'm just I'm reading the report and I wanted to make sure that we were able to to kind of be clear on the report before we received and filed it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also see that and scenario two, that it shows that the CPA mission rates is very different from Edison and a CPA rate. So I wanted to just bring that up. But with that, you know, I'm I'm fine receiving and filing this report and we'll have some comments on other items.'",

Unlike the Edison community, choice uniquely offers the community the ability to choose what kind of energy they have and to be able to fight for the values that they believe in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that was really clear in the CPA's presentation. It's not just about getting energy and cleaner energy. Of course we see it as a better than Edison, but simultaneously they get to opt in to a system that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whose values reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, two years postponing this for two years is actually an urgent matter. We don't have that much time to do this now, is to say that we're already late. So please, please, please follow the implementation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Kobe Sky. Kobe Sky.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Hello, I'm Kobe Sky. I'm a resident of Long Beach in the second district and I am an environmental engineer and proud to serve on the Single City Commission for the City of Long Beach.

        "'speaker_3': 'programs, including the 1980 programs that are functioning very effectively throughout the state. We have three really good options to move forward before to create our own program. Here's a template the way Lancaster has done, or to join the Clean Power Alliance, which is the largest and one of the most effective programs in California.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It doesn't make sense to me that we're raising the same questions that have already been raised three years ago, two years ago and last year. I think we have more than enough information seeing the success that these other programs have shown and the fact that they're addressing the challenges that they have been subject to very effectively.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I strongly recommend that the City Council move forward to sign a letter of intent with the Clean Power Alliance and see the kind of success that they have recognized in advancing renewable energy, creating local jobs and reducing greenhouse gas emission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is an existential issue for the city, and it's very important for us to move forward.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'm calling in today to request that Long Beach join the Clean Power Alliance. I, along with other members of the Climate Taskforce, have been working since the summer of 2019 to commit Long Beach to a renewable energy implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As members of Generation Z, we are acutely aware of the fragility of our relationship with the Earth and the existential threat of climate change. We are so truly lucky to have grown up in a progressive, forward thinking city like Long Beach, and we know that our city has the potential to leave the rest of the country and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sustainability and environmental consciousness. That is why we believe it is time for our city to adopt a 100% renewable energy plan with an earlier deadline than that of the current current state guidelines. The most cost effective and simplest way to achieve 100% renewable energy in Long Beach will be switching our energy provider to clean power lines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This would provide all of the environmental benefits of establishing a community choice aggregator without the administrative burden or economic instability. The young people in the city are depending upon government leaders to protect our future, and we cannot afford to defer this decision any longer.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Patricia Chen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, great. Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and council members. My name is Richard Chin. I'm speaking on behalf of the green team of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Long Beach. You use the. We are located in Council District five.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And that concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to go back to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you. All the great community members that have spoken today. Obviously, there's a lot of interest, a lot of people that have been working on this for a long time. There's clearly a lot of data and info that still needs to be had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'd like to just briefly talk about what what we could do to get that info. It's my understanding that not a letter of intent, but just saying that we are interested in getting some more of the data in working with CPA is something that doesn't tie our hands.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not a vote for an implementation plan or an ordinance. It's a simple vote that makes it possible for us to move on to the next step. Is that your understanding? City manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So what we understand is the motion that's that's here is it sounds like you're modifying that a little bit. So there is a process through CPA where you can ask to join them or to express an interest at which point they they do require you to pay them about $30,000 to go through a process where they'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do some further analysis and then ask their board if they would like to consider adding another city. And then there is a stopping point where you would know, you know, we would be able to to make a decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if that's the motion, that would not tie your hands to actually implement. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wonderful. That's what I was hoping. I know that there's been a lot of talk because we've got so many passionate people that have been working on this for a long time. I, for instance, I think that that is the motion that we'd like to make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I recognize that the Sustainability Commission and Environmental Committee have done a lot of work on this and had lots of conversations, and that that's what's in front of us today is their recommendation. But I'd like to just make the recommendation and take that next step of getting more data which was in the stock report on the previous'",
        "'speaker_2': 'item. So that would be my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just to be clear, so the motion that we have in front of us is not what the the what was the risk just to go ahead and create the join, but for the city to essentially take the next step and work with work with to get more data and do some data sharing, which is smart'",
        "'speaker_0': ', which is modified by councilmember member Pearce. Mm hmm. That's the motion. I have a second Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Just a few comments. I think this is the first I didn't queue up on the last item because I knew this was the appropriate item to make to make motions and take a few things. I think I acknowledge the urgency and the merit that we need to be creative in the way that we address'",
        "'speaker_1': 'energy. I get that and I support that. And I think it's time that we sort of reevaluate all of our relationships, including the relationship with Edison. You know, Edison has been a partner in the city for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I also think that, you know, that our standards need to improve in terms of how we've dealt with Edison. In North Palm Beach, we have we don't have a lot of open space, you know, something like 1.2 acres of open space for 10,000 residents and some of our most significant open space opportunities in the Edison rights'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of way. We've attempted to work with them over the years to be creative about green belts and other things, and we haven't had any real partnership. Most recently, we had a you know, we're moving forward with our citywide bridge housing facility, our citywide shelter, which is adjacent to five acres of open space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've engaged with them over the years. We haven't gotten anywhere with it. And then they signed a lease for five years with a nursery completely in respect of our discussions with the city. So I'm saying all this to say is the car is one piece, but we also need to just increase our standards for how we engage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with all of our partners. So we're not our communities are not taking it for granted. Now, in terms of the CC, I understand the concerns. I think I think the motion in front of us acknowledges some of the concerns that were raised in terms of the readiness and the risk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there is know I'm a little uncomfortable with two years, I think. But but I understand that this is something that we want to sort of move forward with, with, you know, more than a split vote on Council of five four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is something you want the public on board with. You want the council on board with it. So it takes it will take some time for us to do that. So I'm supportive. I've taken a little bit of time to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm also support of the motion that's here that says, let's sharpen that pencil. Let's not you know, let's not wait. Let's get more information, less engage and get more information and come back to this when we've sort of, you know, we're facing the crisis on multiple fronts when we get a little bit more stability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I heard the consultant say, you know, the risk is a little bit higher today than it was when some of these other groups joined the C CPI. Another thing is that I think that we should as a city, you know, when I heard that we get one vote out of numerous votes, that's concerning to me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to see just in the same way that that I'd like to reevaluate our relationship with others. And I'd also like, if we move forward this, to reevaluate how we have a say in how EPA or whatever apparatus of that, how the governance is structured.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's just, Mark, on behalf of our city and our residents expect us to cut the best deal in their interests, and that's something that I'd be interested in. So I think the motion in front of us, I think, allows us to do that, continue to kind of explore it, but does not tie our hands.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm supportive of that. I think that's what the city council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council Councilmember. Mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Can you hear me, Mia?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I received a couple of notes. Maybe if a Joel's were frustrated with the delivery of power and the blackouts. But I wanted to be clear and get staff's confirmation that the delivery of power, even if we joined us, would still maintain with Southern California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that independent of us, we should be working hand in hand with them to facilitate a strong working relationship with our public works department, to ensure that they are upgrading those those lines and those cabinets underground so that we will not be in as vulnerable position as we were in several years ago during the three day blackout'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and that we are in today with the continued rolling shortages of energy. Is that accurate? And are we working hand in hand with them as their biggest client? I think you had mentioned we make up 10% of their clients.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mommy presidents do. Are we working hand in hand with them to ensure that they are upgrading as quickly as possible, that we have no barriers in their path at City Hall and with public works and development services. Wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's my understanding that they make up 10% of Southern California's customer base. If we joined the Clean Power Alliance today, what percentage of their customer base would we be? Without opt outs if everyone joined. Or did you? Well, I was I guess there's 32 cities that joined.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I heard that and to I'm sorry, 30 cities and two unincorporated areas. And so that would make up just the unincorporated areas or 250,000. We have 5000 residents, but not necessarily residents, residents, people, but not necessarily residents, consumers of power, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or maybe a family of four on one bill. So I'm I'm not clear how many customers do we have of Edison that would be potentially moving over. So it can't be 50%, because if the county of Los Angeles alone is 250,000 and there's 30 other cities, including moderate size like Downey and Carson, I imagine we'd be smaller'",
        "'speaker_2': 'than that. Is that some information you could get back to me? Oh, by.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Volume.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we but we get back to you with the correct numbers on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see. By volume, not by customer number. Oh, that's interesting. So when we make up 10% of Southern California Edison's customers, it's not by number of customers. It's also by volume.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That? I don't know. I'd have to check on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could we get an apples to apples comparison of those two different charts of what that looks like? I think that that's really. Important for us to know in terms of. Who we are in a in a perspective and in a relationship.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's really important that we as a council are taking a closer look. I know that I also have had some issues come up, and I have to work hand in hand with Southern California Edison in my district on bridge repair and other things when they are fixing bolts and the impact to our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we really need to work on that relationship to be a bigger part of that discussion and decision base. Also, a member of the community talked about the number of industrial customers that opted out in any of the other 30 cities that have joined and that it has been much lower.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be great to know what that number or volume is and then what are the costs in staff hours that would be necessary to continue on in this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would have to venture that certainly would involve both John GROSS, Bob Dole and myself and then our staff. So it is quite a bit working with a CPA and with Southern covering Edison to get the data across and work on a final report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then my last question is for Southern California Edison. The CCI option provides residents the alternative to opt into a 35%, 50% or 100% renewable energy. What options do you have available today and what options do you project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will have available two years from now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So Mike Morelli from Southern California, Edison. So we have our base product, which is 35% and climbing as the regulations increase. We have what we call our 50%, but it's kind of a mislabel because it's 50% of the base product and 50%, 100% renewable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's like 67% renewable. And then we have the 100% renewable option. And then as far as products going forward, we're working on community solar and on renewable access for disadvantaged communities. And those in our low income programs predominantly are the programs that are the near term that are that are coming out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excellent. And so on. The last item that we voted on, it sounds as though you will be moving forward on a plan with our staff and bringing that back to us to better understand the renewable sources of energy available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I mean, we're working on a framework that may include a lot of things. I hope it goes into some of the items you you mentioned as far as how to make sure if if there are priorities in the city, such as how we operate in that, then I'd like to get those on the table as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and figure out how we can be more efficient in in meeting those needs of the of the city as well. So it's not kind of just focus on, you know, the energy portion of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wonderful. Well, that answers a lot of my questions. I want to appreciate everyone I met with on this matter. There were letters from community members, both for and against. Even people that are pastors of churches. And I think that the further dialog and while I appreciate public comment where people can come forward and say something for 3'",
        "'speaker_2': 'minutes, and when people write an email and engage with you in advance of an agenda item, you're really able to talk with them about the things that's important. And so the things that sound important to them are the renewable energy component.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How we get there isn't as important, but we need to be moving in that direction. So I'm continuing to listen to the community and my colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. MAYOR. So I'm a little bit I'm feeling like this item is actually in conflict with item ten that we just approved. So maybe I can just ask some clarifying questions. I know we didn't go into them, but there were some included items in item ten that staff is to to do and complete to follow up on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this possibility. And so can the city manager or someone from energy resources go through those staff action items.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So let me start by kind of a summary of what what it is that the staff recommendation was. And then where I see this kind of taking that next step to help you make a decision, because it really is a policy choice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In our recommendation, we were recommending, given the volatility of the market, that we wait for about two years for making any type of decision. In the meantime, we would be doing additional community outreach. We would be doing a governance study and kind of understanding the CPA model versus going our own route versus forming another JPA with another'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city and a couple of other kind of steps and working with Southern California Edison. That's the basic summary. What the motion on the floor is, is kind of asking a policy direction. Do you want to take a little bit of a of another step towards a CCAR?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You would be filing a letter of interest. We would call it that rather than a letter of intent. But it would essentially be a request and spending money with C pay to say give us more information about your model that would allow you and to see if they want to invite us to to participate or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Typically, you file that letter of interest or intent when you are ready to move forward with the CPA or I'm sorry, with a K, and then you would have to come back to council and file an implementation plan and an ordinance and have two readings of the ordinance to move forward with that implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the timeline is, if you wanted to do that, you would have to do all those steps before December. That really is the part that has been removed from the motion is that direction to do it by December.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is an interim step to do it. Is the council asking us to modify the motion to say, take another step in this direction by doing the study and letter of intent and then reviewing that with all of your other governance options and returning to the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So, so the in order for us to express interest in getting more information about their model and asking them to consider us, we have to pay them $30,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This crossing in, what we were told was would be approximately $35,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's for it's can we not get any information about their model without paying them $30,000?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What that does is that pays them to do their own study, not not us. So they have to do their own due diligence and see if they want to invite Long Beach to the dance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So to me, that seems like a very premature step because we're not even sure that we want to dance with them yet. So why would we be paying them $35,000 to vet us to see if they want to be our partner when we haven't decided?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We may very well decide that, but one of the things that came back in the staff report today, which I was I've met with everybody who's asked to meet with me on this, too. And I think there's a lot of, you know, opportunities for us to explore and really look at here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But one of the main parts of the staff recommendation is that we haven't done enough community outreach on this. So why would I pay someone $30,000 to decide if they liked me when I haven't even checked with my constituents that we want to participate in this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm not in favor of this motion. I am in favor of shortening that two year window to a one year window. And I want to appreciate the and Councilmember Pearce has mentioned this several times, the number of people who have worked on this for many years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. I'm incredibly indebted to the organizations that have worked on this for years. I'm not really sure what the goal post of getting some sort of a letter filed is. I know there's going to be a $35,000 transfer of money to another organization, but I'm not really sure what that goal post is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm very grateful for the community members who have participated. I'm also very grateful for the city staff who have participated in this, all of whom are people whose subject matter expertize I rely on to do my job every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the staff report that was delivered tonight was to me very eye opening. So I would like to make a substitute motion to. Not file a letter of interest, but to shorten the window of time that staff will bring this back to the council from two years to one year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that would be my substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second on that? So a second on that. Okay. But no second. So that. That'll. That'll die.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Second by Councilmember one. Go. Moving on. It doesn't run. Mongo, did you have any comments on that or did you want to keep going?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We might have more information. I also feel it's very important that we get that report back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Moving on to Councilwoman Zendejas. Councilman's and has. Councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're sorry about that? Was trying to unmute. Yeah. This is a this is something that, you know, it's been a lot on my mind lately. I know that there has been a lot of work put into this for a very, very long time, you know?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From my colleagues as well as from. You know, the community. I want to thank all the community members that have really stepped up and have really invested their time throughout the years in getting us to this point. I know that for me, something like this is very important because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It affects a lot of the people in my district having three elementary schools right here, but close to the 710. I can't help but think about the children that are affected that grow up with having all kinds of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Illnesses due to the quality of the pollution that we have here. And, you know, so this is very important to moving forward and, you know, creating some kind of solution now. You know, I'm very supportive of coming up with solutions, you know, and finding out more information on how we can make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that, you know, we're still in the beginning stages of this to some sort. You know, to some people it might feel like that, even though to others that might feel like we've been at this for years and years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I really look forward to to working together not only as as a council, but working together as a as a city, as a community to really bring forward these, you know, these these creative solutions that will help everyone at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that being said, I would like to make a sub sub. And in that self-serve, I think I would want to include Kevin. Getting back some of the original message and also including on their letter of a letter the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Intent. So that we could move forward. But with that, I would also like to include working with with the city I'm sorry, a letter of intent and working with the city and having city staff work with development services on every step of the way and having six months check in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also I would like to propose that I know that it is expensive but that. You know, but in the long run, I think that we owe it to our constituents, to our city, to our residents to move forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And actually. So first of all, city staff are trying to break it up into pieces. But if you could tell me what your what you're following as of right now, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is Charlie Parker in Council Member. I'm not clear on your substitute substitute motion. The original motion was to prepare and send a letter of interest along with a contract to receive additional information. There's a substitute motion that would shorten the time period from the city of Long Beach from two years to one year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then, as I understand what you mentioned, is that you wanted to make a substitute substitute motion to send a letter of intent or a letter of interest. And then I didn't know it was six month check in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. It was a letter in intent, please. Not a letter of interest. I confused myself. A letter with a six month check in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to be clear, the letter of intent is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A more formal process that will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Move this forward. A letter of interest will allow us to collect data and analyze that data.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So there is a sub sub for Don. I need a second on the sub sub, please. Second.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Call, Mr. Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, spoke a bit earlier. I hear the concerns on both sides. I want to sort of simplify this. The concern, the readiness I heard was about making a decision or committing staff to do you know what Tom said?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, he's going to have to take some of the best people and focus it. This motion that Councilwoman Sun has as it doesn't encumber staff to reprioritize projects. It's really about getting additional data and information. It doesn't fly the cities and allows us to get through a very difficult year that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I've heard on I've heard a number of folks say, hey, two years is too long. This says, hey, let's give it a year. Come back to it. I think that's fair. I think that's fair enough. So I think this is a good compromise motion here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If folks are concerned about what the what the cost is, the 30, $35,000, I think city staff can come back with some options for us to consider. I'm sure there are some ways to look at paying for discretionary dollars, look at the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I even think this may be something we look to see if there's $5 to help support. But I really don't see a downside with this motion. A lot of people are invested in in our climate, invest in our future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so it's important to me that folks feel included and feel good about this process. As we understand and address our concerns, we should be able to express that this is something we're going to continue to take seriously and not just going to delay for two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I encourage I think this is a good compromise motion. I think the city council should adopt this. I'm going to support this motion. I strongly encourage the city council, adopt this and looking forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Count Councilor Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues for the comments they've been making on this. I've been listening with a great amount of interest. I didn't say anything on the eight and ten because I thought that was just a stack of audio as we see the file.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I didn't really chime in too much. And now I'm feeling that this is where we need to really put our money, where our mouth is. And if we want to have an interest in creating a either as a separate JPA or a separate CTA or joint CPA doesn't matter to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What matters is having the complete and full information that allows us to make a complete decision that is full of information and that makes us feel comfortable in whatever decision or whatever direction we take on this. So I am supportive of the subject to such a motion because it does it is a compromise that brings the two'",
        "'speaker_3': 'motions together to their interest, which would provide more information for us to evaluate and look at. And it also includes a when you can arrive closer to that would bring it that much sooner to us. You know, there was an analogy made about the 35,000 to go to dance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While you know what you're looking at going to the prom, you make a commitment, you pay for your tickets, you buy a dress where you get a title, you get the concert, you get whatever it is, and you get ready for the best.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we present your ticket. They let you in. So this is pretty much along the same lines, literally. It's great to have somebody to dance. So the end of the day, it's how we react to the information we receive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm really looking forward to serving this not further to getting all the information we need to make a real sound and a decision that will be best for not only our communities but regional as well, that we what I represent, which is an area that that is more important than a freeway and a river runs to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it. And I got a lot of the last few weeks and said, I'm definitely interested in trying to lower our carbon footprint, looking at getting rid of our gas, our greenhouse gases, and moving forward with an electrical electrical energy plan that the Lord supports.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I have support with that subsidy. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember over now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I actually queued up so long ago, I think we were just I think it was before the submission. So I guess I'd like to just comment on the last two comments. And that is, I believe the compromise was made when the length of time was changed from two years to one year, and that was in'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm still not exactly sure what we are seeking to accomplish with the substitute motions of the. And I agree with councilmember supernormal. Item ten seem to be pretty resolute. And in item ten it directs the city manager to prepare a study that does an analysis of governance options, including forming a standalone city enterprise, creating new joint'",

There there are a number of directives in the the item previous to the one that we are here now that I really think accomplishes the same thing and shows that our city is very much interested in TCAS or looking at alternatives to what we have today'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in terms of energy. And so I'm a little perplexed with the urgency, particularly when we have discussed the the financial uncertainty that we face right now as a city. And I'm just saying everything is. Is related to timing here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course, it is feasible. And we've we've walked down that path already. We understand the feasibility of the question, I guess, to me is, is the most impractical and irresponsible for us to move in this direction right now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not so certain of that, so I don't think I'll be supporting the motion on before us right now. And I certainly hope we can come together with the Council and understand that again, we voted 902 to receive a final report and give our city managers, our city manager, clear direction on how to move forward on this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'issue. I support that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, everyone. I hope that we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do great mine. Do you mind if everyone goes? It hasn't gone first. And I go back to the people that are. Well, they're gone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's some misunderstandings on the floor of the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I appreciate everyone's comments on this. And I think that this is not something that is in contradiction to the last item. Mainly, this is something that operationalize is the vote that we took before. And the money is not necessarily to give directly to CPA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's money for the exact same consultants to do a deeper dove. And it was my understanding that we might have some money left over from our contract with IMR. W is that true? City Manager.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm going to ask, um, Chris or Bob or John to answer that more specifically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If the question I understand is where the $35,000 goes, it goes to CPA to cover their costs for doing a study, whether they want us to join or to allow us to join CPA. Now, of course.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The question is the money. It's my understanding and I know that we've got both the consultants on here and RW and CPA. It's my understanding that the money is used for M RW to do the deeper analysis along with CPA and that we would be billed later on for the balance that $35 is the cap, but we'd'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be billed for the balance. Not that it's something we would have to allocate today. So I'm not sure if one of them wants to clarify on that process. And then I'd like to to talk about resources for for funding that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's certainly my understanding that and this is from CPA, that we would pay them directly $35,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am so CPA. I believe that that Ted is still on the call. It's sad.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, yes, I'm. I'm. I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you do this for me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So the vast majority of the data that was in the feasibility study talked about the financial viability of of. Of China's Long Beach starting its own care. We have a different cost structure. We have a different rate structure than was studied in that in that in in the feasibility study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need to look at it from our perspective and our data to know if it's viable if it's a viable option that you would like to consider. That costs consulting dollars, and every penny that you would pay us would go to M.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'RW, who is already your consultant to undertake the study using our cost structure, our load profile, how you would fit in, in addition to the fact that we already have built reserves over time. So it's it would be a reimbursement to CPA that would for the charges that are w would would fill us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's no financial benefit to Clean Power Alliance in this arrangement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for that. And so I just wanted to make sure that we were clear that this is something just to extend us to be able to do that deeper dove and just operationalizing the task that we already voted on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I know what, Matt, I know that everybody's received a lot of calls on this. I know we've got a lot of community. I think there's a lot of knee jerk responses from some not the council per se, but other folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, there's I am fine to put whatever resources I can use from my discretionary funds to move forward on this. I think that it is the right step. But I also believe that that we've identified that we need to spend resources for the CPA or not the CPA before the cap, and that these resources are in line'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with the goals that we've already identified as as a city. If we do not take this step, then we are. There's not resources there to make sure that we're getting the data and information that so many of the community members have asked us for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd also like to address that there aren't just costs associated with joining us. There's costs with not joining us. There's a ton of reports out there, and I know that we don't have this data in front of us, and I hope it comes forward with this with the CAP discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we spend three we spend 200 and $224 billion a year based on climate health outcomes as a country. So there are a lot of costs, but I think that this is a middle road. I think respect for the fact that we've all been going through a lot of process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was completely surprised by the fact that Edison was invited to participate today. I know that there are community members that have a lot of questions about the appearance of conflict of interest, because we as a city are a member of support and super does, you know, isn't somebody that technically would go and advocate for clean energy'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I know that that we are part of five other associations that have to deal with the oil industry. We need to have that debate and that conversation down the road. I tried not to have it today, but I think that if we don't vote to help operationalize the previous vote that council took, that it will appear as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'such. And so I'm really asking as respectfully as I can for my colleagues to see that this is a pretty soft landing compared to where the community members have been advocating for and those that were supportive of it last week before they changed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Community members and organizations that decided to change their mind. It's a good process to go through and we just need to be able to have the resources to do it. So I don't know that I have 35. I probably do, but I do think that it is resources that we should all be spending together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to hear counsel conversation just on those facts, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thanks. Mary Andrews. Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pearce, I really appreciate your comments. I came into the day with a very open mind and I still have a very open mind. I think that the challenge I have is that some of the statements being made are in conflict with what I'm hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to make sure that I'm hearing correctly because I don't think that we're in the same place. You're saying that we are going to look at more information, but the information that the $35,000 pays for is not information for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is actually information for them. It doesn't concern us what their rate loads are. That's for them to know if they want to invite us. It's it's still unsure if we want to be invited. And as a kind of a single mom who was barely able to afford to go to prom, I didn't get to buy a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ticket. I didn't put forward the money until I knew I could afford to go. And right now we are in some very uncertain times. And it sounds to me like you don't even know if your budget has the 35,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think 35,000 is a small investment. We've already spent over 200,000. So I'm not as conflicted about just the amount. But here we're talking about. When else to do the study of their organization on whether or not they want to invite us to the party.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we're not sure we want to go to the party. And so I actually thought I would be in a different place now than I was before. And it happened to me a few times over the last week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's part of the process of really listening to that and kind of waiting it out. I want to know, quite frankly, if we can get to this clean energy point without taking the risks. But I do want Southern California Edison to take us seriously and want to have that timeline condense to one year, because I'",
        "'speaker_2': 'don't want to be sitting around twiddling their thumbs if they don't come to the table with an offer that is exceeding what their current performances. And so I think that we are in a really great position with what was passed in item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I really appreciate Mary's efforts to create a soft landing. I think item ten can already accomplish that. So I'll be supporting the substitute motion, not the item on the floor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. I've been listening to everyone who tries to speak on this, but we're going to do a, you know, potentially raise rate for prices, you know, for players prices. I think we need to do more outreach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's why I'm going to support, you know, council members prices, price, emotions that we can so we can, you know, study this for one more year instead of two and come back with a recommendation on the CTA when we are hopefully recovering from this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everything else is going on in and, you know, economy. And thank you very much, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, vice mayor. Next up is councilwoman. Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. I do have 35 and I'm committed to raise that money. I guess the question that I. I would ask one more time is the fact, you know, I know that the staff's presentation had a lot of conversation about risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I read the full report. It is feasible. And I do think that we are at a place where we deserve to get more info. It is info about what it would look like if Long Beach joined EPA. They might come back and say it's not feasible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that that is a very solid next step that doesn't require staff time. So I respectfully would ask council members in De Haas to amend or accept my friendly to pay for the 35 K out of my own divide by nine and and include that in your motion and see if possibly taking that off the'",
