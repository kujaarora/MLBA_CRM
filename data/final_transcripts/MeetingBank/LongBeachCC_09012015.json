        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia, council members, for the opportunity to present the Water Department's 2016 budget. Let me begin by acknowledging the commission President Harry Salts gave her, who's patiently sitting here waiting for me to talk fast so we can get back to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also my incoming replacement, Chris Gardner. If if if the commission had acted a couple weeks quicker, he could be giving a presentation tonight, not me. But anyway, let me also introduce my two staff here with me, Anatole Fallon's our assistant general manager, and then Paul Fujita, who who's our finance manager and has our budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So here we go. The right one in the water department. We have two unique two different funds and they're discrete and kept separate. The water fund is our largest fund accounts for about 85% of our expenditures. And then so I'll talk about that first and then later I'll talk about the sewer fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's what we call an infrastructure driven fund. About 70 million of the 106 million in the water fund is non-personal services. A lot of that has to do with purchasing water. And I'll go over some of those costs in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our personnel, our personal services, about 23 million, and then our capital improvement program, about 13.4 million. And I'll talk about each one of those areas in a bit. This shows you we get 40% of our water from the Metropolitan Water District, which we purchase from them, and 60% of our water we pump from our local groundwater aquifer'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And when we do that, we pay a what's called a replenishment assessment to the water replenishment district. So this shows you the costs that we've absorbed in the last since from 2009 to 2016. From those two entities, the metropolitan water districts, rates have gone up, compounded 85% during that time period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the water replenishment district's rates have gone up 87%. And during that same time period, we've raised our rates 50%. So we've been absorbing those costs for many years now, running a deficit budget for many years now and spending down our reserves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, you can't continue to do that forever. So a few years ago, we developed a five year plan to realign our costs and our revenues. And so fiscal year 2016 is the third year of that five year plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The five year plan anticipated 4% per year water rate increases to bring the budget into balance. You can see in 2016 that even with a 4% rate increase, which is what we're recommending, we're still running a deficit budget of about $6.2 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But then you can see how possibly as early as 17, but certainly by fiscal year 18, which is the fifth year of the five year plan with continued 4% rate increase as we come into balance. So we're right on track.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, it looks like we're on track to complete the five year plan in the fourth year. And so hopefully Mr. Garner will follow through on that next year. But anyway, that's good news that we're tracking hopefully a year ahead of getting back into a balanced budget situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the programs we're very proud of and that we don't get up in the don't end up in the newspapers very often about is our pipe replacement program. We've had a very extensive pipe replacement program in the water department for over 20 years now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the red line is the the success of that program. The red line is our main breaks. You can see that we used to regularly have 100 to 150 main breaks per year. And for the last several years we've been hovering around 30 main breaks a year, and that's due to the investment that we've been making.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About 6.2 million of that $13 million capital program is replacing old cast iron pipe and the green bars. There you can see that we've now replaced over half of our cast iron pipe, but we still have a lot to go, lots of work to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we'll be replacing Pipe for many, many years to go to come. But again, our main breaks have been reduced by from 100, 150 to running about 30 for the last several years. Moving on to our summer of fun.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're again, this is our smaller fun. I get to clarify, this is the sanitary sewers. It's not the storm drains or storm sewers. Those are managed by our public works department. We the water department is responsible for the sanitary sewer system.'",
        "'speaker_2': '15% of our budget. The breakdown between the three components percentagewise is very similar. But what we're dealing with here, it's a little bit different situation. There were new regulations passed by the state several years ago that required us to increase our both our operations and maintenance responsibilities and also our capital improvement work in our our sanitary sewer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'fund. So we did that primarily through issuing a line of credit, in essence, a credit card. And we've been using that line of credit for several years now. We've extended it as long as we can, but unfortunately, we we won't be able to extend it again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have to plan now to take it out in fiscal year 2017 and convert it to a long term debt issuance. So the primary driver we have here in our sewer fund is the conversion of that debt in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you see how our expenditures increase from 19 19.5 million to 20.6 million. A million of that is is due to now having to convert that and pay both principal and interest on that, which is now we're just paying interest only in a very low interest rate so that additional million dollars is converting that line of credit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to date to debt. But again, we're in we're in a multiyear plan here for percent rate increases. And again, you see how we come into balance in about 2018 or 2019 with 4% rate increases on our on our sewer fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the things I want to talk about, one of our biggest driver really on the sewer funded sewer operation is preventing sewer overflows. Those are what we don't like to happen. It results in if if it's not contained can result in, you know, getting to our recreational waterways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we take that very seriously. We have a very progressive fats, oil and grease program working with our restaurants that's been very successful, very pleased with with that and the cooperation and the way we work jointly with our health department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're on that program. It's a very successful program. Unfortunately, we have had some increases in sewer overflows this year in residential areas. So we're going to have to work work hard to get out the word this year and hopefully work with the council and the city manager and others, too, to make sure that our that our residents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'understand that it's not acceptable to discharge a grease into our sanitary sewers, because it's almost always grease that's causing these sewer overflows. It's almost always grease. And again, almost all the ones we're having now are in residential neighborhoods as opposed to where they used to be primarily in restaurant areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have implemented some technology, what's called smart manhole covers. And through that technology we've averted we we estimated 56 or 58 sewer overflows over the last six years. So we're using technology to avert sewer overflows. And it's been very successful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've greatly increased the inspection of our sewers as we inspect the sewers. Using closed circuit television, this both drives our cleaning program, which is mainly an on M expense. But it also is what then becomes the input to our capital program, because it's through these inspections that we determine which sewers need to be either realigned to replace'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So we as you can see, we do a lot more inspection of our sewers than we used to. We also do a lot of cleaning. We go through the whole system about on a two year cycle of cleaning the system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some areas require a lot more frequent cleaning than that in areas that are heavily impacted, particularly by grease again. But we spend a lot of time and money inspecting and cleaning the sewers. This is a before and after picture of a sewer that was cracked that we identified in inspection and and how we realigned it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whenever we can, we realign a sewer rather than dig it up and replace replace it. Not only is that better for the community, less traffic congestion, but also it's much more cost effective to rely on a sewer working from manhole to manhole rather than tear up the whole street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is what we do, if at all possible, is realign relining as shown here, getting to the you know, what are the rate increases? Again, our recommendation is 4% for water and 4% per sewer. What does that mean on the typical monthly bill?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This shows you what the typical monthly bill would bill would do for a single family home in Long Beach using 12 billing units per month, which is what our typical single family home uses. It's a combined increase of $2.20 under the water and sewer bill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe it's $0.44 on the sewer bill and a dollar 76 on the water bill. How does that compare to our peers and the rest of large cities in California and our neighbors? This graph not only includes the payment that our customers make to us, but it also includes the payment that our customers make to the L.A.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'County Sanitation District through their property tax bill. So you can see that when you add those together, we are the lowest combined water and sewer bill of any large city in California, or what's called the L.A. County Average, which is a grouping of several of the cities in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also one private operator, Golden State Water, which does provide service in a small part of Long Beach. And we have another one, Cal Water Service, which has similar rates to Golden State. So our our combined water and sewer rates are some of the lowest of any large city in California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that completes my presentation. We have answered the questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know this doesn't sound exciting, but the idea that we have done such a remarkable job of maintaining the assets that we have underground is really remarkable. Because if if we did spend all the money that we are allocating millions of dollars a year to repave our streets and then to have to go back and deal with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those issues later. You've done a remarkable job, and we really appreciate that. Thank you for the presentation you gave to my office the other day. I thought it was quite informative. I also want to take a moment to appreciate the technology that you have deployed recently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we discussed that I was one of your pilot programs and you quickly sent me a letter letting me know that I had a leak I didn't know about. And that leak caused me to immediately call a plumber.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we did a quite a extensive investigation to find out that just a tiny bit of water was leaking every single day through a flap in the back of the toilet. And so to be able to see this technology in action firsthand has been remarkable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really appreciate the innovative things that you've done. You will be missed greatly. We are looking forward to the leadership of Mr. Gardner, but you have some very, very large shoes to fill. So thank you very much for all you've done for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you to the commission that has been a leader along the way, because without a board of interested neighbors who are looking out for everyone, we wouldn't be in the position we are. You guys have been just such a group of financially conservative individuals that have put us in a remarkable place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very much. Councilor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just wanted to chime in and just say that although, you know, these things may not be in the newspaper, it's a good thing when your own water department is not in the newspaper. Secondly, if you're not in the newspaper, maybe you should talk to your board member.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Harry Salts gave or about that. But in all seriousness, thank you so much for your for your presentation. And we do have this conversation every year. It's great to see you're making the investments in our water mains. We would hate to see water main breaks in our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These are important to our residents. They're important to the safety, the health and safety of our community. So we're glad to have you here and we're sorry to see you go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to echo all of those comments. I'm curious, in the time that you've been with the water department, have you ever had a water situation such as we have now in the state of California? And how how has it been for you in terms of your leadership in these times?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because, you know, we get a lot of concerns from residents and whether we're using reclaimed water and our parks and that kind of thing. I'm just curious in terms of how that experience has been for you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, there's no question that this is that when you consider the the impacts of the drought we're in, this is the most serious that anybody has ever lived through in California history. But hydrological, it's not that much more severe than other droughts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But when you consider the population increase that we've had, I mean, the last drought that we had was. Perhaps similar to this, we have, I think, about 9 million more people living in California than we did. Now that we did anything but that, that's more than two cities in Los Angeles that we've added to our population.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And since the last drought, that's fairly similar to this hydrological. The other thing is, you know, we've had additional endangered species restrictions put on our imported water supplies. So those imported water supplies are under a lot more restrictive conditions than they were in any previous drought.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's no question this is the most significant drought in terms of impact that California's ever experienced. And it's it's been exciting. We'll talk about that later. But I mean, Long Beach has just stepped up and done a tremendous job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's been a tremendous pleasure for me to be able to help lead Long Beach and provide the leadership that Long Beach has provided for the whole state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, you've done a tremendous job, and I appreciate the budget report that you've given us. And again, similar to the comments made with the harbor department, I appreciate the attention to to responsibility and and proceeding prudently. And I think that that's appreciated by council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I share the sentiments of Councilman Richardson in saying that it is it is a good thing when your water department is not in the press in this day and age. So thank you. Thanks to your team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you. I'd like to join my colleagues in complimenting the water department, Mr. Guardia and your entire staff for great work. It shows here that we are being very fiscally responsible. It's well-planned out. The rate increases, I believe, are fair.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we still remain a leader in the state. I'm concerned. Understanding that this is your last budget presentation, I'm a little concerned about the brain drain, no pun intended, from the department, from the top level, but also from its labor force as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I see that there. Is there any significant change in terms of personnel, the personnel situation over at the water department today?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, our staffing numbers have been flat for several years. But as as you are correct, we are in a increasingly competitive market and retaining staff is becoming a very serious issue for us. I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I because we talked about this in our present briefing a week or so ago. Can can you just elaborate on what the competitive market means and how that is impacting staffing at the water?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it's interesting. I didn't want to brag, but I've use this as a lead in. You know, we talked about our water main breaks. And, of course, you always read about one other very large city in Los Angeles County in the newspaper that has a lot of water main breaks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, they have five times as many water main breaks per mile of pipe line in that city as we do in Long Beach. Well, they've apparently decided that it's time that they should do something about that. And one of the things they're doing about that is they're in a very extensive hiring binge to hire employees who know'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how to install and fix water mains and. We're the victim of that hiring thing that they're on. We've lost several of our best rank and file employees to them, and we have a number of a large number that are apparently on the next round that they're going to be making offers to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're they're rating us. Yeah. Okay. So thank you. I don't need 25% more than we do, so there's only so much we can do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did you say 20 to 25% more? Yes. Well, that's pretty significant. I know we have a we just hired a new h.r. Director, and so I know that that'll just be on the list of challenges for for that individual to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much. I always appreciate your candor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. You know, first of all, I'd like to thank you and your department because of the fact that, you know, with the parks I have in my district, they still are green. I don't know where the water is coming from, but they still are green.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would just like to say it's one. Yeah. Know, one question is what about the impact, you know, to your long term rate outlook?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you for that, because that's a question we get all the time. You read about it all, all the time in the paper that with conservation and reduced sales, that water utilities are going to have to raise their rates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And of course, the public hates that that you're raising rates when you're forcing them to conserve. But again, we're right on track. We're right on track. In fact, it looks like we may complete this five year plan in four years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's been no changes to our proposed five year financial plan in those 4% per year rate increases as a result of of all the things we're doing with conservation and in addressing this drought.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Rank.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. Brain drain. Yes. Mr. Garner is going to have a challenge there with the making of some of that brainpower, as well as some of that some of the employees that are leaving. All joking aside, Mr. Worry, I want to thank you for your leadership with the water department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That was very pleasing. I know it was said about keeping the water department out of the out of the press, but out of the press that I saw was always very positive in that Long Beach was ahead in its conservation of water with other municipalities up and down the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that was due mainly because of your leadership on that. And I want to extend my congratulations to you and being very prudent with our water resources, with being very prudent with their rates, keeping the the enterprise that we had that we call the water department balanced and working forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I guess I sort of contributed to that too as as well as I see my front lawn getting browner and browner. So I guess, you know, I have contributed to that to that to that concern conservation. So I want to thank you again and I wish you well in your retirement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a congratulations on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your retirement as well. You've left us in a really great place. And seeing the budget, as my colleagues mentioned, even with a little increase, it still looks great. And again, you've left us in a in a wonderful place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just wanted to thank you for that. And also the steps we're taking internally as a city I think is is wonderful and reducing our water usage. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I wanted to thank heaven not just for his presentation tonight, but really for his years of service. How long have you been with. Let me try to lower 14. Okay. So I've known Kevin before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Long Beach Water from early, early days of consulting and Metropolitan Water District. And so many of you heard me talk about us having the finest general manager, water general manager, and not just in the region, I think in the entire state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we lose when Kevin leaves, which I know we have a great person coming in, Chris Garner. There's something about the industry that it's very difficult to have that kind of institutional knowledge, and so I will definitely miss that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the budget piece, I think you covered how we have kept our rates low and kept our increases minimal. And I know you don't like to toot your own horn or even that of your entire department, but during the years, during the three years, the metropolitan raised rates by 20%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We actually did not raise our residents rates by any amount we held at zero for those three years. We felt that it was important to recognize our residents for the work that they're doing, the conservation efforts that they're making.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And really, they our residents are the leaders in certainly, I believe in the Metropolitan Water Districts Service area of all those counties and entities and cities within that service area, six county service area. And many times we look to Long Beach residents and ask other communities to follow suit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wanted to touch on the sewer fund a little bit, and I know that you have created a plan to ensure that our pipeline replacement is on track. I think many of us read the article this morning about how the decreased use of water and decreased amounts going through these pipes causes cracks and and surges and all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those other things end up being really costly. Can you address that here for us and how that might be different here? Because we've been conserving for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I read the article. I think I've for the most part, I think I agree with Lester Snow's comment, which was most of that was a bunch of nonsense. Yes. But, you know, I was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hoping you'd be direct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I always like to be direct, but I think, you know, it may be first of all, we're not seeing the tree root issue that some others claim they're seeing. We're not seeing septic water in our sewers that others claim they're seeing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it could be that the accumulation of Greece that we are seeing is related to lower flows and that the grease isn't getting flushed out. So we do need to ramp up our public outreach and make sure that the residents know that they need to properly dispose of grease and not dump it down the sewer so that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that may be happening. There may be a little accumulation of grease that otherwise would have gotten flushed down and not accumulated in the sewer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's the greater problem, not the unintended consequence of conservation. It just it illuminates what that original problem is. So thank you for that. I too want to bemoan our losing key staff members to other agencies. It is a salaries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'War of the salaries. And when other agencies pay more for the same level of work, that's it's difficult to stay competitive. So I will look to our new H.R. director and really this council to take a look at various positions and and see how we can ensure that our investment stays in Long Beach for Long Beach residents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to benefit from with this kind of expertize. And Councilmember Your Honor, letting our we used to say that Brown is the new Green, but it's really the California gold. We don't say Brown. If you look at your grass, it's really golden on the yellow side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's that's what that's what our state slogan is. California gold. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member, supermom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you for your service to the community and congratulations on their retirement. And thank you for all your presentations to committees and commissions that I've been on before because you do a lot of duty other than prison.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The council here. Years ago you had an outreach program on fog. And I guess that's probably your option that you can do. Now, just just to get the word out there again on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. But I think, you know, we want to work through the council offices and city manager offices. You know, we want to use every opportunity we can to get to get that message out there to the residents about proper disposal of grease.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it wouldn't be a water. I mean, it wouldn't just be the water department. We need to work through all those venues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. But your presentation, that concludes the budget. But we're going to go straight into item 20 because I believe it's a continuation of that. Mr. Parker, did you have an announcement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Public comment on the budget?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was know I was going to do it after this, but we should probably do it in between public comment on either the budget presentations we just heard. Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just want to address you directly. What a resident should do when in their apartment, the shower and the bath continues to run. Code Enforcement Per Amy Burdick, Craig Wong, Carmelo Baca. They did an expression on June 23rd.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They were in the bathroom with me physically. Over a month ago they did witness the water wasting and it's been over a month and it's still running. They've done nothing about it. Her Stone Community Foundation, the apartment owners have yet to remedy it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't know why they're being exempt from compliance. They do own five complexes in Long Beach, so it would be high impactful to have it investigated. I've come to as many people as I can, including council Robert and is still running is still waiting today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you go to right now, 600 hours of the windows are boarded up with wood over 90% boarded up. The water is in there running and no one has done anything about it. Again, the address is 1600 words of a9004 apartment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Number six, Craig Wong told me, Well, you're the only one to complain, so please, if you can look into that for me, for the community. Thank you.'"

So I'm going to turn this over to our Interim Parks Recreation Marine Director Steven Scott and also our executive director of the Water Department'",
        "'speaker_10': ', Kevin Water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just going to go first and then turned over to Steve. This is really in response to how is how are we proceeding with. Meeting the requirements of the State Water Resources Control Board's executive order to conserve water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's really two elements of it. One is a requirement that the water provider reduce its water consumption by a certain percentage. And I'll talk about that. And then the second requirement is that street medians that have ornamental turf grass not be irrigated with potable water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's the hard part that Steve is going to address. So I'll just give you our results, how we're doing in terms of reducing our consumption citywide. We're we're in the 16% tier. So again, this is a we need to reduce our water consumption by 16% from 2013.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's actually over the nine month period of June of this year through February of next year. So it's being accounted for on a month to month basis, but actually it's on that entire nine month period. And here you see how we've done now for the first three months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've exceeded our 16% target every month. We were actually 19% in June, 19% in July. And then we just announced today that we're 18% in August. So we're comfortably exceeding our requirement. And then then this just shows cumulative cumulatively over that three month period how we've done so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cumulatively, we're down 18.7% for that three month period. So I would just. Turn it to Steve. But at this point, I would just like to say how proud the water department is of our residents, of our businesses. They've stepped up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've done a tremendous job. This is despite having conserved a lot of water before 2013. So we're working at against a very, very low baseline. And and we're still doing almost 19% beyond what we were doing in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Long Beach continues to do tremendous things in terms of water conservation. The city is a tremendous partner on that. Parks and Rec has done a great job. The city manager and the city manager's office have been extremely cooperative and helpful and had a lot of great ideas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really want to thank Mary Garcia, Mayor Garcia personally for being involved in some of our outreach campaign and and all the council members for what you've done to encourage our citizens to conserve. So, again, we're just very, very proud of what Long Beach is accomplishing and continuing to provide leadership for the entire state of California'",

Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council, the Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine works hard to balance the need for safe and enjoyable parks for all visitors while fully embracing that.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The remaining 46% or 588 acres are irrigated with potable water. The department's expanded use of reclaimed water is restricted by both the available supply, particularly during the peak usage summer months and its limited distribution infrastructure throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also want to note that use of reclaimed water is not subject to a number of the state and local water restrictions. The next line. So as we all know, the department needs both rainwater and water provided by the water department to help keep our parks healthy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we all know, our rainwater supply has fallen significantly short over the last few years. Typically, we could expect anywhere between ten, 11 and 12 inches of rain water each year to help maintain our turf and trees. Over the last three years, however, we have averaged closer to around six inches of rainfall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So a significant reduction to the amount of water for our turf and trees. So the rest of the water, though, is supplied via our irrigation activities. And over the last three years, the department has utilized on average 750 million gallons of water to help irrigate our open spaces.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do want to point out that as a result of our compliance with the statewide water goals and the conservation efforts noted in the following slides, the Department has realized an estimated 16.5% reduction in water usage for irrigation since April of this year versus the same period last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's over 40 million gallons of water saved. The Department is and again is in compliance with the state water statewide watering restrictions. We water our parks and open spaces twice weekly with potable water, just like the residential units throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What's different with us, however, is that we aren't on the same watering schedule. While those are Tuesday and Saturday here in Long Beach, we've worked with the water department to allow us to modify our schedule to a Sunday night through Monday morning and Thursday night through Friday morning schedule.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's to limit the impact on park users, particularly on our busiest day of the week, Saturday. There are other reasons why you might see us watering on other days other than that Sunday night, Monday morning, or Thursday night, Friday morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those include when we do athletic field renovations and we need to reseed or restore those fields or we have new planted areas. Even with drought tolerant installations, we need to extensively water those in the first couple of weeks just so that they can take root.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also have a couple of sites that are on very old manual irrigation systems, which require staff to actually go out and physically water the entire park area by manually. And then lastly, we work daily to repair and test our irrigation systems, which may require us to turn on the water to ensure that our systems are working'",
        "'speaker_2': 'properly and the water distribution is being applied appropriately. And lastly, we've eliminated, as Kevin mentioned, the use of potable water for irrigating our ornamental turf or grass street medians. And again, this is consistent with the governor's mandate to stop that activity on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff perform a wide array of maintenance activities to ensure the efficient functioning of our irrigation systems. And a number of those activities are noted here at the bottom of this slide. So the department has been proactive in planning for the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We completed a landscape irrigation audit last year funded by the Metropolitan Water District or MWD via our Water Department, and this was performed by a certified irrigation auditing firm. And then earlier this year, the department finalized a citywide park tree inventory providing critical data about our trees, including location, species and health.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Both of these studies are critical to helping us make informed decisions about our water utilization activities. Some of our other strategic investments include the upgrading of antiquated irrigation infrastructure, such as at locations at Hartwell Park and Stearns Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Water Department has applied for partial funding for 800 additional smart meters. If approved, many of those meters will find their way to city water or water accounts to enable the city to better manage our water consumption. We are also seeking opportunities to convert our natural turf to drought tolerant installations in areas that don't get much play'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or usage in a park and use synthetic turf on heavily used athletic fields. We've been working with Technology and Innovation Department to install the communications infrastructure to connect our Cal sense controllers, to better manage our irrigation systems and do it remotely from a smartphone or a desktop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been working with Public Works and again the water department to assess water loss in some of our park lakes, including those at El Dorado Nature Center and El Dorado West Park. And we're exploring opportunities to utilize non-potable water to refill those bodies in urban stormwater treatment facilities being pursued adjacent to the Los Angeles River to reduce'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the consumption of potable water and to create a new source of recycled water that will allow the city to continue the irrigation of its parks and public landscapes in that area without the use of potable water. And then lastly, in response again to the governor's mandate to stop irrigating street medians with that contained grass with potable water'",
        "'speaker_2': ', we have initiated an invitation to bid process to address the 77 different locations of street medians throughout our city. The first phase of that project will really be to go in and remove the grass from those medians. What we'll do then is we'll kind of cap the irrigation head so that, you know, they aren't in use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we will keep open any irrigation heads that are watering trees that are in our street medians. And then the second then we'll go and mulch those medians. And then the second phase of that project will be to provide for the installation of drought tolerant plants and other potential hardscape or other landscaping on those on those medians'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So proposed funding in FY16 will help us to start this project, but it is a project that is going to be expensive and a long time to complete and it would be dependent upon future availability of funds. The invitation to bid has been released and it's anticipated that the vendor could start the project later this calendar year'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And we're going to continue our operating and funding partnerships with entities like MWD and the Water Department while MWD is rebate program has dried up. We will continue to work with our water department to take advantage of one of their two turf conversion rebate programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, turf removal works towards achieving our conservation goals while producing a sustainable, natural look, as you can see in the pictures on the slide. So there's still much more to do in our efforts to use our limited water resources efficiently and effectively as possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to continue to identify opportunities for turf conversion in our parks and opportunities to modernize our irrigation systems. As we design new parks or redesign existing parks, we're going to make sure we do that consistent with the California water efficiency standards, which includes ensuring that we are planting low water usage plants and efficient water efficiency irrigation'",
        "'speaker_2': 'systems. We're going to use our tree trimming opportunities. We're going to strategically invest in improving the health of our urban force to ensure that our trees are better able to maximize the use of the limited water resources. We're going to use industry best practices to make the most of what we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We realize that this is our new operating normal, and so we're going to have to get the most out of what we currently have. So a couple of examples that we're looking at is improving the tree irrigation opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we're concerned in the long term that a prolonged drought in limited water resources on our trees could stretch those trees in the future. We want to take steps now to make sure that we are maximizing the flow of water to those deeper root zones.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So one thing we'll be doing is removing grass and plant life from around the base of the trees again to ensure water can get down to those deep root zones. And then we're also looking at other opportunities like working with the water department to see if we can't modify again our watering schedules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An example is aggregating our watering sessions from eight monthly 15 minute sessions to perhaps a couple of fewer but longer watering sessions so that the water that's applied at those longer periods of time have a better chance of, again, percolating and getting down to the deeper root levels of our trees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So and lastly, our park users are an extension of our eyes and ears. If they see any water loss through broken irrigation lines or heads or sidewalks being watered, we ask that they contact us through the Go Long Beach app.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The email address on the slide or just the of our department a call and we'll make sure to get staff on there to correct those things right away. So in conclusion, the department looks at the current conditions again as our new operating normal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While we're looking at possible wet season coming up, the single event is not anticipated to be sustained, nor will it change the overall amount of water available for irrigation in the foreseeable future. So therefore, we need to continue our efforts to make the most out of what we're currently have and to make strategic investments in the future'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to better position the department to act to adapt to these conditions. So that concludes my presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I have a couple questions. Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank you for the work that you've done to date. I know that there's a lot of discussion online related to some of the turf fields, specifically within Eldorado Park that that area is a reclaimed water area and there wouldn't actually be any water savings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Should we change over to the turf fields and for neighbors to continue to be patient? We have a few more meetings to go and then hopefully in September will be coming forward with an alternative plan that will not utilize the $1.7 million at the Wardlow Studebaker location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That will not include a fence in that area, that will not include light from that area. But most importantly, in working with the soccer organizations, which I just started reaching out to them today after gaining a lot of neighborhood input and that we'll go with the type of grass that's less injuries than the clumping grass that we've'",
        "'speaker_1': 'used in the past. And that also aligns with the California standards that we can water appropriately in our park. So you guys have made great strides to date. We really appreciate that. Specifically, all of the medians that you have changed the direction of the water from accidentally washing our cars on the way home from council meetings at'",
        "'speaker_1': '11:00 at night to now watering the medians appropriately. So thank you for the work you've done. And then one more big thank you to the Boy Scouts who have reached out and done a lot of media and projects in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eagle Scout projects that turn grass into more drought resistant opportunities. This is a really great partnership and we're really thankful for all the things that our young people are doing to make it even better. So thank you very much and thank you for your support of Long Beach Volunteer Day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I too want to thank both departments for the collaboration. It's nice to see you guys coming together to address a very relevant issue in the city. I have a couple of questions in regards to updating our irrigation systems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that you've done some, but I'm assuming there's still more to go. And if so, do we have a plan in place in terms of our future budgeting goals to update that infrastructure?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Pryce and members of the City Council. So as I mentioned in the presentation, we completed a landscape irrigation audit last year that is has helped us prioritize the irrigation improvement needs out there. And so we have that ready as new funding becomes available, whether that's through one time funding appropriated by the city council or other funding'",
        "'speaker_2': 'perhaps through state county grants. We're going to pursue every opportunity to identify funding, to upgrade to upgrade these irrigation systems. But as of right now, operationally, we do not have an identified funding source for all of our irrigation needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But again, based on that prioritized list, we're going to go after grant funds. Hopefully there'll be some bond funds available in future years and any identified non-recurring funds from the city council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm not sure if you if you know this right now or not. If you don't, we can talk offline. But do you happen to have an idea of what the amount would be if we were to upgrade the systems citywide?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you have a range?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're still pulling those numbers together. And so that should be available probably within the next month or so. But, you know, each each location in our parks is or irrigation system is unique. And that's one of the struggles that we're having that it's not an easy the average per square foot cost to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Upgrade or improve an irrigation system doesn't necessarily or can't effectively apply to all of our parks. So we're trying to address those on a park by park basis. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is one of the issues that I wanted to address. And it's it's it may seem like kind of an insignificant one, but to me, it's it's a big one. And I know I've talked about it with you and your team during our regular monthly meetings, but I think it's important that we have a consistent citywide public'",
        "'speaker_3': 'outreach methodology for letting residents know that we are using reclaimed water. And so I know that you guys have improved the signage and tried to make them consistent. But when you when you walk around the various parks just in the third district, you'll see signs that look different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not sure if they were put up by different departments or by our department at different times, but sometimes they're different in color, they're different in font. There's there doesn't seem to be a campaign. And granted, we're experiencing unprecedented times in regards to the drought.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So maybe we haven't given much attention to a public outreach campaign to educate the public about the use of reclaimed water and also their placement. You know, sometimes they're on trees, sometimes they're on stop signs, sometimes they're on light poles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, they're and they're at different levels, sometimes at eye level, sometimes they're higher, sometimes they're never lower. They're usually eye level or higher. So, you know, again, this may seem kind of like an insignificant thing, but the average resident in the city isn't watching council meeting tonight and understanding that we're using reclaimed water.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What they are doing is driving by and missing the signs or looking at the various signs as an eyesore that makes an otherwise beautiful park look not as pristine because there's signs in different colors, you know, mounted to whatever surface a sign could have been posted on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so what I would love to see is for our department to take a real ownership interest in making sure that the the signage that we have that educate the public in terms of our use of reclaimed water are consistent, that they're affixed to consistent foundations throughout the city, and that we really give a little bit of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'pride and care into to our signage. In regards to that, again, I think it would go a long way and we do our very best in terms of and I know my colleagues do too, in terms of social media and trying to reach out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And also in our newsletter we talk about the use of reclaimed water, because I think that is probably the single biggest concern that have been that has been raised by residents in regards to water usage by the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I appreciate that you're working on it. I just want the public to know what you're doing and to know in a visually pleasing way. And then finally, in regards to the medians when we go from. From grass to drought, tolerant of what other bases are available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ground cover is available because sometimes the ground cover, if there is any ground cover, still appears to look dry and not at all fresh, even though the plantings are fresh. So are we able to use stone or bark?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are there other ground cover options available to us for medians that could help kind of enhance some of the succulents and the rock placements and things that we're putting in?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Price Yes, there are other opportunities to provide different types of ground cover on the medians. You gave the example of Bach, you gave the example of small stones. And I guess I'm thinking of maybe more rocks, larger rocks, but boulders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there are different opportunities that we have to provide some form of ground cover. It doesn't need to be a straight mulch on everything. And that would be part of our efforts as we go through that next phase, which is adding the drought tolerant installations, is identifying what those might be and and keeping them fresh in different'",
        "'speaker_2': 'places. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that would be a nice focus in terms of our medians, is to try to make them visually pleasing somehow with the ground cover that we're choosing. I think the ground cover can really help the plants that we're putting in pop in a way that we're not currently, I think, using to the best of our ability'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And I get it. The additional ground cover probably has an additional price. And so mulch is our standard. But I'd like to see us step it up a little bit if we can citywide, because I know that that's something that we can certainly do district wide with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we have divide by $9 available, we can certainly allocate it to that. But I'd like to see us have that option citywide as we look towards improvements. So thank you very much for the report. And again, thanks to both departments for your collaboration on this report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just want to take a moment and say that I really see this as an opportunity. You've done a great job at putting together this this presentation. But, you know, I think a lot of our meetings that we do have and some of our parks space hasn't been maintained very well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the and it's actually an opportunity to go in and refresh some of our meetings that do have maybe some grass that hasn't been maintained or maybe park entryways, that that sort of might be it might have been rundown.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I know that we're taking on some of those some of those projects already. But my question is particularly about the the rebates. So I know that I converted my lawn to garden and in my front yard, and it was a fun process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're still learning things, checking out different different plant types. But what do you have available? What is it? Does the city have access to those same rebates and what is the level? When I did it, it was $3 a square foot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What is the level that you have?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Richardson, members of the City Council. There are a couple of rebate programs through the Long Beach Water Department that we will do and will have access to. One is for small projects that are under a thousand square feet and I believe the current rebate rate for that is $2.50.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then there is a second rebate program that is for larger projects, up to 15,000 square feet, and that is a $1 per square foot rebate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I'd like to just encourage you and I know that we've had this conversation particularly about the Highland Park master plan and the renovation renovations there, utilizing rebates and other funding mechanisms to maybe improve entryways or other things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I would just encourage you to continue to be creative. Think about other rebates and funding sources that might be out there from other water districts so that we can continue to to do this outside of our parks, but also in our in our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Scott, I want to thank you for your service. I know you stepped into a very difficult situation here, especially with coming down with a drought and having to deal with all the changes in irrigation that you had to do and medians and and trying to be as creative and very innovative and stepping into'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a very, very difficult seat at this present time. One of the things that concerns me the most is obviously the conversion of turf into artificial turf. And there's a lot of issues that are being raised in that regard, in regards to safety for players who may be looking at playing in artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I understand that Admiral Kit Park in my district is one of those areas has been looked at in converting sod into artificial turf and the associated concerns that are raised with that in regard to the type or the or the various types of artificial turf turf that are that are available.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just for the sake of of of education, can you describe what's out there in regards to some options in artificial turf and some of the concerns that there is? There was a recent article, I think, that just came out in regards to artificial turf that because of this heat wave that we had some of those pellets yet'",
        "'speaker_8': 'were where were melting. And and that's created in the in the I think it was the L.A. Unified School District that created concerns for for kids playing out there and and attaching to their to their clothes, if not to their skin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could you give us what are some of those options that are available out there in regards to artificial turf that we are looking at? Especially because the concern I have is obviously advocate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Daga and members of the City Council. So there are a number of different infill materials for synthetic turf fields. The lion's share of the fields out there use an infill product that is made up of recycled crumb rubber.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there had been some health concerns regarding the use of that infill material. The materials that you're speaking of with respect along are Los Angeles Unified School District is a another kind of rubber plastic that's called TPI. That's a thermoplastic elastomer that is manufactured plastic and rubber.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there have been some examples of batches of that product where it in extreme heat has can become gummy and kind of melted and sticks to players shoes. Those are two examples of infill materials, though, that we are not looking at.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our Parks and Rec Commission has recommended that we pursue inorganic infill material, and some of those examples are ground up coconut husks or caulk as infill options. And so we are proceeding down the road of inorganic infill material, not a crumb rubber or recycled tire or other plastic rubber infill material.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And we also there has also been a concern raised that because artificial turf gets a little hotter than it would be natural turf, that there's a there's a need to cool them off. And what's the difference between cooling them off with, say, recycled water, reclaimed water, as opposed to potable water?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we're looking at a at a time when we're trying to conserve potable water. This raises obviously an issue for in that respect with with artificial turf. Can you explain that into a clarification?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, for the purposes of cooling the fields, and that's typically when you have some of these other products, like the TPI I mentioned or the crumb rubber, it is not uncommon to have a cooling or irrigation system there to apply water to cool the fields with respect to recycled versus potable water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recycled water is not recommended and in some cases will void the warranty of the synthetic turf manufacturer. And so the irrigation to cool would need to be potable water. The example of Admiral Kidd Park, that park is already potable water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so would be no change for a cooling system for synthetic turf at that park. The other issue would be if you used reclaimed water, you wouldn't want to be spraying the fields in between two games, you know, your your noon and 1:00 game and then get everybody off the field and spray with reclaimed water.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just want to avoid any unnecessary contact with reclaimed water.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Well, thank you. And that's what I was actually looking for in terms of the overall change in water usage. Wouldn't wouldn't be different. That would be insignificant in regards to what's already existing in the use of water when it comes to those artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I'm hoping that that technology in the future will be such that we could get some some infill that would be much more water friendly. For lack of a better term, that would not require such a high level maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If. If at all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And finally, Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues for their thoughtful comments and questions. This is exactly the conversation that I thought we should have and had in mind when our agenda raised this report back weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you. Parks and Recreation and Water Department. I did have a couple of questions. As we know, this is a very serious matter that we're dealing with. We're dealing with an unprecedented shortage of water. So our conservation efforts need to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My priority. I was curious to know, since we've initiated this this stage two restrictions, how many citations have been issued to residents and fines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do I believe it's five or six now. Five or six different residents have gotten citations, some of them gotten multiple citations. That's why I hesitated. I think it's five different customers. One of them, for example, got four citations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's five customers, and it may be more like ten total citations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, it's. That's unfortunate for those that handful of residents. But I think it shows that, you know, we have great compliance citywide by residents. So that's good news. I take that as good news. And somebody wanted me to ask the question of what is the status of the LBE must proposal?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Long Beach Municipal Urban Stormwater Treatment proposal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Austin, members of the council. So we must do something we're very excited about. It's a project that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Santa monica has a version of it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That they did a while ago. But we're looking at kind of breaking ground with this project and creating a very innovative way to both reuse our stormwater.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clean our stormwater.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then use that water to irrigate our parks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which are currently we have a dearth.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of reclaimed water lines on the west side of town. And so using that water to to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Irrigate our parks, we are in the feasibility stage right now. We are exploring and putting together a plan. We believe there's significant federal and state opportunities to fund this and even through the stormwater regulations, the ability for upstream river cities to pay for this as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're in the feasibility stage right now and in doing the planning on how it will fit into Drake, Chavez Park is a beneficial use in that park as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As helping with our water needs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do we have any expectation as to when that study will be completed and come back before the council? Or do we need to take action on that? Is that something we need to to wait for funding sources to come available?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I don't have it at the top of my head right now when we'll be done with that study. We are applying for federal grants to be able to get that. And Kevin actually has some money that is really reserved only for the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Water department to deal with reclaimed water lines that he's been.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Very gracious in sharing that authorization at the federal level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we've.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Been pursuing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We expect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just probably early next year to come back to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You, at least with an update and tell you where we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Are with that. And of course, we would need our council authorization before we take the next step and dedicate funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you very much. I have no further questions. Thank you for the presentations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Any public comment on that item? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very good you Kirk as the address the suggestion relative to rocks where you can get a good inventory of them along the band concert park in the Marine Stadium. You can take those and replace it with what? An upgraded version of what.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Used to be there. There used to be a chain link.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fence that was in a number one condition because it was so far back from the water. It wasn't corroded. And against the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very strong objections of the police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Department and without telling the director of Parks Recreation, Mr. Phil Hester.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or the neighbors, some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doofus ripped it out and ushered in nocturnal graffiti for 3 to 5.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Years. So my suggestion is take those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rocks, use them in your mediums, replace it and put fencing like now lines the entrance to the Marine Stadium up there. And I'd also put in a couple of brick pillars, replicating the type of treatment that is along side of on PCH.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By the count, by the Cal State residential area just south of Clark. Really attractive. Nice. So you can pick up the bricks tomorrow. You could pick up the rocks tomorrow and nobody is missing and shouldn't take long to put the fence in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. And Cantrell and I have. A poster here. With artificial turf. I appreciate the many things that you are doing to conserve water for the parks and the medians. I think the drought tolerant plants on the medians makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But. Drought tolerant plants and artificial turf do not make sense in public parks where people come to enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Natural grass and the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Trees and the amenities of the park. Artificial turf also has a lot of problems on soccer fields, as I referred to today. There was the L.A. school district's problem with melting soccer fields that are made of artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even though we are considering an organic type of fill. Made out of cork or coconut has. The grass is still plastic. Plastic gets hot when sun shines on it, as you probably are all aware. It also has lead in it, so it is not healthy for children to be playing on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you put it in portions of the park which are, quote, unused, I believe people are going to be walking their dogs there. Plastic retains the odor of urine. There's a lot of problems with putting artificial turf in a park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the soccer people. What level? Well-maintained grass fields. Most players will tell you they prefer grass. The reason that artificial turf was suggested was because. It was supposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To save water, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has been pointed out it has to be cooled. It has to be washed off. Kids sweat, they vomit, they bleed on, and the turf has to be washed. Even the organic turf has to be watered to keep it moist and pliable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would ask you not to try to save water by putting in artificial turf. Thank you. Other places. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Any other comments? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know. Stand up here. My name is Ramon. I'm a District five. I support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stacy's doing or Ms.. Was doing for Eldorado Park. She's worked hard. It looks like it's a. So best alternatives that we can get for another underwater park. Steve great presentation. I just saw your thing that you that was put out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know it probably wasn't done very well, not too much notice, but you got it out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I got a question and I know I'm not going to get an.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Answer because I'm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Supposed to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Say something. But for these parks that are that don't have just a potable water and no recycling water. I know there's a huge cost that we got to get over a million bucks per park to put that in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What is the problem in getting a pipe going to give em? Uh, um, what do you call reconstituted water to get that going and put it in tanks and get these guys going on regular grass? Um, we are throwing out a lot of water in the, the mornings and days, as you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And all we need to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is just get a larger tank.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And get a pipeline going, do whatever we need to do and to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Capture that water.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Send it over. It's going to be safer for the kids. I used to work at a mill. I used to. I'm one of the people that was at Milliken High School.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I was part of the soccer team that brought the school district to recognize soccer. So I feel a little bit of responsibility. I'm now 15 more older.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I have no vested interest in this. But but I am for trying to get a grasp.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Feel this is what the pros.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Play on. This is what everybody wants. This is what the women, uh, the best women in the world are. American team wants to play on, and there's no reason why we can't do it. It's a lot cheaper to maintain grass than it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is to maintain artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can tell you that the main issue is where the head counts and the amount of people that are on it, not with the overall prices that the way people are working. There's a lot of studies, a lot of surveys on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, I mean, I've done it, I've researched it. I've even talked to the end users, the coaches, the coaches don't want to have artificial turf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are the high schools, Jordan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All these schools.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You haven't even talked to the and I'm not talking to you, but you haven't even talked to the the end users, the coaches themselves who are pros.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of them have played in the World Cup.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's what I'm all I'm saying is try to think about using recycled water and making that thing work for that for that, you know, maybe expanding the use of reclaimed water, seeing what if there's something else you can do, it's a lot safer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I got 7 seconds left. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. But you're all doing a great job and. We finally I know I got no set time left, but we know that Mark.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Taylor is spearheading to try to get these things in. I'd like to get a meeting with Mark Taylor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Diana Ladd Jeans. I second pretty much everything that an Cantrell said. I personally put in artificial grass and drought tolerant in my whole front. I tore up my whole front lawn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, that's what I did. And I did that, by the way, before there was a rebate, before there was any incentive. And, um, do we have an important conversation here? Heidi, can you continue, please? Yeah, well, bottom line is I've had to take care of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when I have. I have dogs that will come by and I've had them poop and throw up and do things like that. And I actually have to go out. I've had to go out with a scrub brush and brush that off to clean it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It did not come clean like grass does. And so it's a real concern to me and absolutely right. It's not healthy. And I just addressed a body here earlier tonight about what our greatest natural resources, it's our children and it's not healthy for the kids.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do not believe it should be used as a place to plan. You know, you. Many of you have children here. Think about your own kids. You want them to be in a healthy environment. You want them to play in a in a place that's going to be good for them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm strongly suggesting that you find another way, use recycled water, do whatever they do, even be better off, frankly, healthier plane under than than this artificial grass. So I'm strongly suggesting you really consider the health of your children, the health of our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren in my case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello there. My name is Summer Wells, fifth District Plaza area. Stacy, I just want to thank you for looking into new initiatives because it has been a major issue about the soccer fields and using synthetic turf. And I appreciate you working hard to find a better solution, which I encourage all of the rest of the city council'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to do. I do not support synthetic turf in Long Beach for many reasons. One is the maintenance issue, some of which was just previously addressed. It doesn't go without maintenance. Just because you put it down, it doesn't mean it needs to be not maintained.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Animals, dogs, people throwing their sodas, bacteria, it basically kind of collects in this space in unless you maintain it, which we really haven't vetted out those costs. Even when we've been talking about the soccer fields, it's always been a big question mark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much is this going to cost? Does the city really want to take that on? You know, at that gamble. Secondly, the big gamble is the infill. We are still, as is expressed here tonight, is looking at new organic materials.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't know what those will do. You know, maybe two years from now they'll be a better solution. Maybe not. But so far, you know, we haven't really had any good data that supports if coconut infill really works, if some of these other materials that we've been discussing actually really work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, again, do we want to take on that risk or, you know, wait it out a bit until there's a better solution or you guys come up with a better solution. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So you no other public comments? There's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries nine zero.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that, can we just give a big round of applause for outgoing, outgoing general manager of the water department? Kevin, thank you. We know, we know he still has some time, but an incredible service, of course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he's been a great resource for us and a great manager. And we want to also congratulate our new general manager of the water department, Chris Garner, who's also in the audience, though. Thank you, Chris, for. Which means now we have to find a new director of gas and oil.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Which which is next? So. So thank you for that. We closed the hearings in the item. We have item 20, which is the first item we're going to hear. But I'm feeling bad for the public comment folks who are who haven't gone yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me try to get through the the public comment lists quickly. So we'll get to our item, which is 20. Bill Ferris. Is Bill Ferris here? I'm sorry for mispronounce for your last name. Please come forward. If we can have Corey Allen come forward and Daniel the.'"

    "Recommendation to receive and file the Medical Cannabis Task Force recommendations regarding the establishment of a medical cannabis regulatory ordinance.  (Citywide)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Is Mr. Cromwell here? No. And I think I called for Jim Meyer, which I didn't see. So we're going to go to it now to item 20, which is the Medical Cannabis Task Force recommendations item. And then we will go on with the rest of the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Cook Adam, I am 20 report from City Clerk. Recommendation to receive and file the Medical Cannabis Task Force recommendations regarding the establishment of a medical cannabis regulatory ordinance citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to turn this now over to staff. Might need a minute just to get ready. Here are you guys. I'll give you guys a minute here. You guys ready to go? Almost. Can you guys just begin when you're ready, please?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor and members of the city council. As you know, a number of months ago, the city council passed a resolution that established a medical marijuana task force. That task force has been meeting from basically April through August, almost on a weekly or bi weekly basis to come up with various recommendations to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will say the city attorney's office, the city clerk's office staffed almost virtually all of those meetings. We did staff all of those meetings, and the task force worked very, very diligently. They have diverse interests. Clearly, on the task force, they tackled a very, very difficult issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They absorbed a lot of information before they came up with the recommendations. The recommendations are included in the in the staff report that was prepared by the city clerk's office for consideration. There are approximately 30 recommendations that the task force has made for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They concluded their work on August 19th. If you have any questions about the various recommendations that were made by the task force, we'd be glad to try and answer them. I believe there are members of the task force here tonight that could address some of the issues or the questions, I'm sure, if they speak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that concludes our staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I think everyone has had a chance probably to review the recommendations and taken a look at those. So I have some comments and then I'm going to turn this over to the Council on the Public for for comments as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's been, I think, two pretty significant developments that have happened in the conversation about medicinal marijuana and just marijuana and cannabis legislation in general over the course of the last of last few months, in particular, since even our last conversation here at the council and I just wanted to highlight those one was a pretty public conversation and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a continuing conversation that has happened because of a statewide report that was led by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, as well as a variety of medical leaders across the state about the use and implications of of future recreational use, medicinal marijuana, as well as kind of a guideline for for cities and for for the state to adopt regulations'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at the same time that that that came out in that report, which I think is pretty significant. I would encourage for those who haven't had a chance to read it, I've had a chance to to read it. The legislature has been pretty active in passing a set of bills or a package of bills that really speaks to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'medical marijuana. And I think the council received an update from our government affairs director, Diana Tang, which I think most of you probably have. But I wanted to highlight a few things. I was in Sacramento yesterday, and I've also been having some conversations with some of our legislators, and it's important for us to review where we're at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'right now. Assembly Bill 266 is currently in the Legislature and has incredible momentum as we speak. Currently, right now, Assembly Bill 266, which is gaining both bipartisan support, as well as support from the governor's office, essentially is looking at creating a statewide framework for medical marijuana and a statewide look at how cities could provide regulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The framework currently has been amended significantly, but the Appropriations Committee has moved forward as a placeholder bill, which essentially means that the governor's office is currently working with the legislators and on the Senate and Assembly side to put together a bill that could then pass the legislature, and that he would sign.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All indications to our lobbyists in Sacramento and our government affairs team here on the ground is that the legislature is highly likely to pass a statewide bill by the end of their legislative session, which essentially is September the 11th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So any bill before the legislature has to pass by this September 11th. That's the first thing I wanted to note. We also indicated for the governor has until October of I believe is the 11th of to actually sign any bills.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But he has he normally indicates pretty quickly whether he's going to sign a bill. In fact, it's it's more often than not that the legislature passes a bill and he'll sign it the next day or the following day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dependent so the legislature could pass this bill any time between now and the 11th. But after the 11th, there's absolutely no chance for a bill in this session, just to be very to be very clear. So we could end up with is a statewide regulatory framework by September the 11th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, also, to be clear, the where the bill stands now and what is likely to happen is this bill is going to provide cities essentially two options. Option one is to adopt the statewide regulations and then to approve local zoning laws that essentially a council could adopt, change a make their own or be to have a ban'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on medical marijuana, which is essentially what the city of Long Beach currently has, but is obviously contemplating on changing. So the state law does allow for cities to have flexibility. Just just to be clear. The other thing that's I think as important is if the state law passes, it would be actually in direct conflict with a lot'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the proposed ordinance that the Planning Commission even adopted. And I think that's a really important point because there are some there are issues, whether it's a seed to sale conversation or whether it's the security piece or the testing piece that are all being addressed right now by the state legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I see that because the the quote unquote, draft ordinance that's been kind of in front of the council would. Would not be legal, essentially, in the case of of the current body. And so it's it's incredibly important that we get some some clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I what I'm hoping and where I hope that this conversation leads us tonight is is one I think it's very important that we first see the legislative framework that we're going to essentially get between now and September the 11th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That legislative framework will give us an answer, a variety of questions that the council has had for many years on types of licenses, on testing, on actually where and when, where you can grow. As one example, I think this council in the past has tried to limit growing to within the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The statewide legislation would not allow that that it would allow open an open state market. And so my suggestion to the to the council is going to be whatever we're crafting, make sure that we are we are adhering first and foremost to what the governor is likely to sign by within the next couple of weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At that point, the council still has land, land use decisions to make if it chooses to move forward and obviously always has the option of not moving forward. And that's a decision the council will will be able to make.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do encourage while I'm as as frustrated on the timeline as everybody else, I think these two weeks are going to be very decisive weeks in the conversation about medicinal cannabis in the entire state of California. And I think we should cautiously listen, see what comes out of the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then if the council chooses, adopt an ordinance by essentially answering a handful of zoning questions, which will be which the city attorney will be able to to present. So I wanted to put that on the table. I think everyone has a memo on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the time is is of the essence as we move this forward. And certainly, I hope that this council can come to a decision fairly quickly on on on how and if we move forward. And so I wanted to kind of set the stage as this conversation develops.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so with that, I'm going to turn this over to the council, and I know we're going to have some public comment as well. So let me begin with Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I appreciate your framing the issue for us, especially given the recent visit you had in Sacramento. And I appreciate your following. The state legislature legislative process, along with what the governor has indicated. I think you and I are very much aligned in what our hope is for our city's process going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've spoken on this just as you have for many years and have served on this council, hoping to come forward with a reasonable policy for the city of Long Beach. And I wanted to thank our task force members for their involvement and contribution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is not easy to spend that kind of time when you have your full time work, full time lives to manage, and you've committed of yourself to the city's work on this issue. And I want to thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In particular, I'd like to thank our second District representatives, Jack and Adam, for your attendance and thoughtful input. Also wanted to thank our staff for your diligence. Throughout this entire process, the city attorney and his staff are doing their best to guide us through what's really felt like quite a maze or quite a labyrinth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it has been a process, and it reminds us that public policy isn't easy, especially when we have diverging opinions and we have conflicting approaches from neighboring cities. It's not easy, but I do know that our city staff has been doing their best and has been doing it in earnest for what is in the best interest of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all interested parties and also in keeping with what is legal in our state. I believe that the recommendations that the task force has come forward with, they do reflect the complexity of the issue and the realities really of implementing a new policy initiative with so much legal and legislative history.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's not easy as a citizen task force to take this on. Some may have had familiarity with the subject matter from an academic standpoint or a professional standpoint, but nonetheless, it's not easy. There is very little regulatory history to follow, and that made your task even harder.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I do believe that these recommendations and the bulk of our city attorney and Planning Commission draft ordinance. While it's true that the mayor indicated that if the state's measure does pass it, it does put a lot of that in conflict.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I actually appreciate that kind of statewide guidance. It's very difficult to take things on as a city, especially issues of such magnitude. We did that with the plastic bag ordinance and we were a leader in doing that, and it was at a time when the state was not able to come forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and here I I'm very hopeful with the indication that the state might come forward with a framework. Nonetheless, we have many groups that have worked on this. We have ideas that have been presented. And hopefully in short order, we will have guidance from a statewide measure, whether it is from the legislature or directly from the governor's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'office. So hearing the recent legislative conversations between the governor, legislators in Sacramento, our mayor, other mayors, they're providing another layer of complexity to this issue. I think it might be a welcome layer. I'm hopeful for that. I've seen pieces of what's being proposed and it does give me hope.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I am hopeful that whatever does come forward out of their discussions, it's a pathway for cities such as Long Beach who wish to help our residents obtain medical marijuana in a safe, reliable and regulated manner. But there are always going to be outstanding questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have local obligations. Land use is something that we always have local control over. And so that's something that I would look to our city attorney to guide us through that. And, Mr. Mayor, what I'd like to do, if it's timely, is make an offer, a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'd like to move. That we receive and file the Medical Cannabis Cannabis Task Force recommendations regarding the establishment of a medical cannabis regulatory ordinance and direct the city attorney in conjunction with Development Services Department to report back to the City Council by September 2nd.'",
        "'speaker_4': '22nd. Sorry. Or tomorrow. The implications of Assembly Bill 266 on the city's own ability to adopt a medical marijuana regulatory ordinance and provide a list of outstanding areas of regulation at the local level that Council must address in order to put forward a comprehensive ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Additionally, I'd like to ask that our City Attorney help counsel understand where the Medical Medical Cannabis Task Force recommendations differ or share common ground with the recommendations made by the Planning Commission regarding a medical marijuana regulatory ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's a. Carlton convulses at a second. Okay, so there's emotion on a second. And just to add to get to the emotion, essentially, I think, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, you're asking for the issue to come back by the 22nd, which is the third Tuesday in September.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And by the 22nd at that time, the city attorney would come back with the state regulatory framework, as well as the items that are the the the the items that are not considered in that legislation, which would be which would be a handful of zoning questions for the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Exactly. And the September 22nd date is really giving regard to our budget adoption date or our charter mandated date that we must adopt our budget by. So that would be the next available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To September 15th? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that is the motion on the floor. Let me go through the speakers list. Our Councilwoman Gonzales, did you have any comments?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. They just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also agree and support the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Motion in front of us. And I want to thank as well the task force members for their time. I know personally my two appointees were very diligent in reporting back all of the items that they had been advocating for, not just for our district, but for the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I also want to thank them, and I'm just grateful for their support in making sure that they've advocated for a fair and just system that includes all of Long Beach, not just certain parts of Long Beach. And I believe that this motion is measured.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It takes into account the statewide regulation of coming, while also seeing how our Task Force and Planning Commission align in meeting the best, safest and most accessible, accessible opportunities for our whole city. So thank you, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to take a moment to just thank all the task force members who participated in this process. I know that you took time away from family, from work to make sure that the city of Long Beach gets it right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And for that. I just want to say thank you. And I know that it hasn't been easy to work with a large group and try to come to consensus. But you work together, and I've reviewed every single one of the recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I got to say, the ones that have, for the most part, the unanimous support, I thought they were well-considered, well aligned with the direction the council. The council has given in the past. And, and and I'm a bit surprised that we actually were actually able to bring something back to that process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so thank you for that. And I wanted to also say that, quite frankly, I'm glad that the state has stepped up to provide some framework. You know, I I was starting to believe that this process had a little bit too many cooks in the kitchen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is a cleaner process. So I'm in complete support of the motion, and I look forward to the conversation on the 22nd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. Just for clarification, for me personally to understand the motion much, much better. We're talking about having the city attorney. Review the task force recommendations and compare that with what's what's being put forward from the governor's office and coming up with a potential ordinance that we can adopt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Well, and I want to acknowledge also the members of the task force for their diligence and work in coming here. Could you stand up and just be recognized? Those of you who are here for the task force.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Don't be shy. It's okay, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the reason I wanted to acknowledge you, obviously, is because it was a I understand it was a very difficult process. There was a lot of give and take. There were a lot of issues that you had to address.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it might not have been the most smooth process in getting to where we're at right now with this recommendation that we're receiving here today. And and I'm not going to go ahead and point that out. I think that we've had we've had enough discussion about that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I do want to recognize you for your diligence, for your patience, and for your willingness to step up and address the very important issue, which is for us, Long Beach is going to be, I think, historic, and I think it's going to be something that's going to be good for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When I first made the motion a couple of months ago to do to establish the task force, which was actually a piggyback on what Councilmember Suja had a few years back, which went nowhere. And I think that we got somewhere at this point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we're we're almost there. We're at the end, the turn at the Preakness, and we're ready to go home. So I'm hoping that when we when it's all said and done, that we will have an ordinance that is going to be workable, that is going to be very positive, and it's going to produce some very positive'",
        "'speaker_8': 'results for the city of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank the members of the task for a task force. I know that you worked very diligently. I met regularly with the members of the third district who were representing the city on the task force and received regular updates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My understanding from the process is that it wasn't necessarily smooth all the time, but that everyone had the opportunity to share their concerns and that the recommendations and the diversity in terms of the recommendations reflect the various opinions of folks who were on the task force.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for your service. I appreciate it. And I know my colleagues do. I just want to ask in terms of clarification, because the. The motion has been phrased a few different ways. I just want to make sure that we all understand the process and that the Planning Commission has prepared a draft ordinance, that that ordinance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'went to the task force, but that the city has not made any sort of policy decision in regards to whether or not we are going to have an ordinance. Certainly the option of continuing a ban still remains because I've heard some different things in terms of the comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Price, members of the City Council, as the Mayor indicated, the current draft 1866 does leave open the possibilities for cities to keep bans in place if they have them or adopt bans. So yes, that would be a possibility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we understood the motion, as it was framed, what we would basically be bringing back on the 22nd of September is and then, of course, the result of AB 266 to let you know whether or not it passed, number one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number two, an analysis of AB 266. So we can let the council know what framework the state actually has adopted and what they've left to the city to enact in the form of land use controls as. Council member Vice Mayor Lowenthal mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we will not be bringing back an ordinance for your consideration on the 22nd, although we certainly would consider or be able to take recommendations from the Council as to what we would bring back at a later date for an ordinance which would presumably incorporate some of the recommendations made by the Medical Marijuana Task Force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition to the recommendations or some of the recommendations made by the Planning Commission after their 18 months of studying the issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do you envision that the report that you would come back with on the 22nd would also include perhaps some legal conclusions in regards to what a state regulation or even a state ballot initiative, what impact that might have on a municipality in terms of its ability to regulate and and embrace an industry such as this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. In fact, there's as I understand it, they're still working on AB 266. And the bill that we've analyzed may not actually be the total bill that is actually passed if it is passed. So it will bring back their framework, let you know what they are leaving to us to do and also bring back, as the mayor'",
        "'speaker_2': 'said, a competitor. Vice mayor, Vice Mayor Lowenthal said a comparison between the recommendations made by the Planning Commission on the key issues as opposed to the recommendations made by the task force on the same key issues where they differ, where they're the same, so that the Council will have a better understanding of what we can do on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a local level and also a better understanding of the recommendations made by your two bodies that you've had. Look at this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the things that I have heard but, you know, we've we've heard by various members, whether of the public or of this body, that, you know, there's a sense of urgency to move this forward. And one of the questions that I've asked is, you know, what is that urgency?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And some have said, well, if we implement our own regulations here in the city of Long Beach, then we'll be ahead of of of the game when there are some statewide regulations and statewide ballot initiatives. From a legal standpoint, wouldn't statewide regulations dictate in large part what we as a city do, regardless of what we have in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'place at the time that statewide initiatives are initiated?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It really depends on the format of the statewide initiatives if they're subject to the November 2016 election. We don't know yet what those initiatives will be. Some of those initiatives may very well, like AB 266, reserved certain powers to the local government.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So HB 266, for example, clearly preempts the city from regulating certain areas if they do have a regulatory ordinance in its present form, for example, primarily in the area of public health testing of the product and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in its current format, it does allow cities to adopt zoning regulations, locations, buffer zones, those sorts of things. So we will bring back that information and what we can actually do if HB 266 passes and we can make comments on what we think may happen if a statewide ballot initiative makes it in November of 2016.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree with Councilman Richardson. And in regards to the the desire to have regulation and statewide oversight and guidance on this issue, I. Think that's important in terms of the land use options that they might leave available to a city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you envision those, including things such as buffer zones and restrictions on hours of sale and that kind of thing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'AB 266, as it's currently drafted, definitely does leave those types of decisions to the local public entity. Hours of operation, location and number of facilities. Advertising. Those types of issues buffers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And do you envision, based on your tracking of the legislation thus far, clearly you can't anticipate what is going to happen in the next couple of weeks. But based on your reading of the legislation thus far, do you anticipate that the final product, if, in fact, there's there's a decision reached in terms of the legislation, will still'",
        "'speaker_3': 'allow cities after careful analysis in terms of the potential impacts of this industry to the city, including public safety, regulatory, etc., determines that the the risks outweigh the benefits. Let's say that a ban would still be an option for cities in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me, as 80 to 66 is currently written, it clearly allows cities to maintain a ban if they currently have one, and it also allows cities to enact a ban if they choose to do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in terms of that proposed legislation, I know that you mentioned that statewide testing as being a component of that. I think that's a necessary and excellent regulatory element. Do you have any idea of who would bear the cost of such statewide regulatory elements in a statute?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not clear precisely from 266, at least it wasn't clear to me when I read it. But a lot of those duties will be assigned, for instance, to various state agencies that currently exist, like the State Department of Public Health, the state attorney general's office, and several other agencies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there were six or seven agencies involved. I assume that they will be issued under two 8266. They also will be issuing licenses or permits to operate. So I'm assuming that there will be a permit fee attached to that that maybe would fund the state agencies, or maybe they will devise a situation where when product is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sent to them for testing, there will be a fee for the test itself. It just isn't quite clear yet. It leaves it up to the state agencies that are involved to develop regulations to implement AB 266. So as that unfolds, we'll know more who would be paying for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I envision that your report when you come back on the 22nd will be comprehensive and will encompass a lot of these concerns. And I imagine that that discussion will take a long time in terms of our agenda for that night, because I think there's certainly a lot of legal implications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the question doesn't start and end with. Some of the limited framework that we've heard from either proponents or opponents. It's it's a much more expansive analysis, I think so. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Before I go to the next comment, I kind of have to add something, Mr. Mays, because I think I want to make sure that council understands one piece of this, which is it's kind of confusing the way the legislative process works in Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what's interesting about this, like other bills, you know, we're talking about 266, but the way this really works is there's a bill called to 66. It's passed by the Senate appropriations. But what they did is it gutted the bill before it passes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So even though to 66 and what we're all talking about is the framework that will likely be used. What there is essentially is a clean bill without any detail. And the reason why they do that is because the governor has indicated that he want would like to see something passed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now the governor's office will essentially craft a new version of to 66 that will come. So what Mike is referring to, while I think is generally accurate, I don't want anyone to, you know, kind of harp on him when we know exactly what comes back in is could be very different than what Mike is describing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so while we think we know what the general rules are going to be, what's going to come out in the next, you know, any and this could happen any time. But in the next ten days, we will have this new bill, which could be most of what of what the city attorney discussed, but could also be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'some new things that we that we don't know yet. So I just want to make sure that we we know that as we as we move forward in the next you know, next next two weeks here, Councilwoman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. I want to start out by thanking the members of the task force who so diligently spent lots and lots of time in meetings working through many details. I also have some questions for the city attorney and or Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the things that I think is really helpful in explaining the options to the community is the zone maps. And so I know that one of the challenges that I've had in recent discussions in the community is that we don't have any updated zone maps that reflect any of the either unanimous recommendations or majority recommendations or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'general recommendations from the task force. And so I recognize that the zoning maps would hopefully be updated with the information from 80 to 66. I know that we have business corridor partners here, business owners. We have childcare operators and some of our neighborhood leaders, along with some of our local realtors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's really important to them to know what areas we're talking about. Do you think that we would be able to have those comprehensive maps in advance of the September 22nd meeting so that we can reach out to our community and ensure that they're aware of the locations that are being considered?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think that that is a big component of whether or not the community wants to maintain a ban or not maintain a ban.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Mungo, as the task force moved through this process, we had extensive presentations by the Department of Development Services and their staff, and many of those presentations did include zoning maps that did show accurate representations of what would happen, for instance, if we included libraries within the mix of buffers or licensed childcare facilities or high schools, those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sorts of things. So those maps are available. They were part of the task force, and I'm I don't know that we could I mean, they're available. We could bring them. It takes a while to go through each of those maps because there's one for each council district and they're citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But those maps do exist currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think what we're looking for, though, is one that they're overlaid. So there are a lot of websites now and with the gas technology where you can look at a map and then you can click citywide or fifth District or for the fourth district or third, and then it zooms in and then you can click on a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'layer and say, if we adopt all of the things that the Planning Commission thinks click and then those overlays show up, then you click another button. Then it can be the ones from the task force. I know that those are comprehensive, but could we at least get one map that has everything on it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think that. Each of those decisions is a serious consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the director of Development Services, Amy Bowditch, has indicated to me that we can handle those maps that the task force considered. But 82, 66, as it's currently framed, doesn't address those types of issues at all. The only buffer that's mentioned in HB 266 is a minimum buffer of 600 feet from a high school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what the council has been looking at, the planning commission and the medical marijuana task force are more extensive buffers that include a thousand feet from, for instance, high school schools in general and 1000 feet from licensed daycare facilities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What else can you. Like libraries. And we do have those maps. And buffers between medical marijuana facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in in kind of linking back to what the mayor said, that's what the bill says today. And so neighbors that have concerns can reach out to their Assemblymember whether it's Patrick O'Donnell or whichever district that they live in and they can voice their concerns and or opinions on the the the zoning as it is or that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they want to maintain local control and that we would be able to look at those. And maybe Christine can meet with my chief of staff, can meet with Amy's office and see what we can do to consolidate because providing 20 maps and while we appreciate the diligence of the task force for going through each and every one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of those, we really got to get it down to a sound bite because we're asking the constituents of of Long Beach to weigh in on budget decisions, take the budget challenge e comment all the different things they're involved in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we want to make sure that we're providing them a good, quick view of what the options are so that they can make up an opinion yes, no, or make an adjustment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, everybody. I want to thank the task force for their service. I want to specifically call out the chair, Charlene Bender, and for for for serving at my request and to continue it into who are a district appointees.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to just say that I'm encouraged. You know, we've had this conversation. It's been going on for for quite some time, even before I joined the council. Regarding medical marijuana here in the city. And consistently, I think I've been consistent that I'd like to see direction from the state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it is encouraging that the governor has taken it up and the legislature seems to be serious about getting a bill done within the next couple of weeks or within the next week. And it makes it ensures that Long Beach isn't on the island by itself and dealing with this very fluid issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's encouraging to know that there is some semblance of local control in this that is being discussed in 266 as well, which I, I appreciate. And I and I want to I want to just point out that we're reviewing the task force recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I applaud many of them. They they they address many of the tough questions that we're facing. The council one thing is consistent is that. There. There was there was not necessarily great consensus on on a lot of these tough issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that's that's a challenge that our legislature is going to probably face, but it's a challenge that we as a city council will face as well. So consensus on this issue is very difficult to generate because of deep feelings on both sides of the issue all around as a matter of process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Madam Vice Mayor, I think it is important to note that the last date for a bill in this legislative session to be chapter two is actually October the 11th. Right. And so I'm curious to know how we got to that September 22nd date as as the the date to come back before the council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's September 22nd. Yeah. I mean, because when I say the last date for Bill to be in the legislature, if there is a bill signed, for example, next week, the last day for that to happen or not signed but agreed upon by the legislature.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would be September 11th, I believe. Right. And so typically, as most of you know, who work the legislative process. That doesn't necessarily mean that the governor is going to sign it right away, even though his office may have had some a lot to do with crafting it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He could wait the entire time up until October 14th or 11th, October 11th, or he could not sign it and just allow it to be Chapter ten to the law that way as well. So my question is why the September 22nd date and what's the importance of that, that date?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And why not. October 15th where some insurance as it stood for knowing when this bill knowing exactly when if there is going to be a bill signed or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can partly answer that, but I can give some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If I can. Of course. But my understanding also, having worked many years in that process, is that the governor has 12 days to sign the bill and 30 days to chapter. So that notwithstanding, bringing this back at the earliest date possible, I think is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not problematic given when the signing would be or the chapter would be. We have had a process going on for quite some time and to have the city attorney bring back to us what the differences might be so that we can start considering it, I think is actually a good next step.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Just to add, Councilman, I mean, you actually bring up some you both know the legislative process very well. Just to bring up some additional points, it's our understanding, actually, that this is likely going to be done before the 11th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as as for our outlook, the 11th is the last final date, September. So September 11th is the final date. The legislature usually never meets on September the 11th because it's obviously a day of remembrance of the last days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really, the September is September 10th. And then it's just knowing what they're with, they're dealing with this. This might get wrapped up likely in five or six days. And it's our understanding that we're going to get an indication in immediately after of of of the governor's blessing on this or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, listen, he could change his mind and veto it. But I'm just you know, that's that's I think the timeline we feel is going to be pretty expedited.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My point was just in terms of process and form, if we if for some reason on September 22nd, we don't have clarity, what are we going to do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the item still comes back and the city attorney lets us know that and we can receive and file. But at least it is an active item on our docket.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think if for some weird reason. On the 22nd, we don't know. It becomes a receiving file. And clearly we want to wait. We would we would wait. I would assume, if we still need an additional week or what have you come to an interest group?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Real quickly. Thank you, Mayor. I'd just like to thank the task force and the individuals who be at least a compassion to the situation with our, you know, our youth, our churches in our hospitals. And I don't know what the outcome is going to be, but I think it's really I will support advise me as that, you'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know, motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember super. Now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My questions have been answered, so I'll just thank the task force for all your work over the last few months. And thank you for being here tonight over for over 4 hours as I see it. And also, thank you to our city attorney, assistant city attorney Mike Mace.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think you attended all the meetings, too. And our Clark staff, too. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Arango.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. Just for clarification, the process the the task force has made its recommendations. We have received following those recommendations. We are directing the city attorney to look at those recommendations in addition to the ordinance that was drafted or was put forward to the planning commission.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that right? Okay. Well, there's also a draft ordinance in as part of the task force recommendations. Can I also have that included as part of that review? In reviewing it? That's pretty.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can see where the interest is coming from, but I think. If we take their recommendations and look at the planning commission, their final red line version, look at the measure that is presented by the legislature, that that would provide a sufficient guideline.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ultimately, if the legislature does pass something that may that would end up superseding a lot of what's already been drafted at our level. And so I think just having the city attorney look at the task force recommendations, which there seems to be agreement over the Planning Commission item that they ended up with, and then the legislative measure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would be a good start for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, that's what I meant by process, is that there is an ordinance as part of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, but that ordinance was not voted on. And so I don't think it would be correct for us to take a look at that. The list of recommendations was.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I thought it was Rhode Island and it was a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, it was not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me let me let's get that question answered by staff. So, Mr. Mays, do you have an answer to that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The staff are sorry the task force did not delve into that ordnance at all, at least on a formal level. It was presented to them and it was agreed that it would be attached. But there was never a discussion or never a vote on any of the content of that ordnance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And honestly, if we had to take that ordnance and add it to the other material, there's no way that we could prepare an adequate report for you by the 22nd. It will take a tremendous amount of effort in a very short period of time to pull together a report that analyzes A.B. to 66.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it passes and draws comparisons between the Planning Commission and the Medical Marijuana Task Force recommendations. So for us to do that by the 22nd, it would be virtually impossible and do a good job. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Your anger. Like I said, I wanted some clarification on the process and I see that this was added in there. I missed the fact that it was not voted upon, but I will be supported.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Back to Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm in alignment with Councilmember Austin. If I could see a show of hands of who's here to speak on or weigh in on the marijuana item tonight. So my bigger concern is that I know that I had dozens and dozens of calls even as late as today where people wanted to know where we were in terms of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there were rumors that this was going to be a received file because of AB 22, 66. And so only starting at 1:00 when we knew the details of A.B. 266 and what options we had, did we start letting neighbors know there'll be a future date that they could come back?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we sent out a notice to neighbors. And so what I want to do is I want to value the time that people have in coming down to council. It's really important that neighbors have that opportunity and that they have the information they need in advance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if the item is not ready. By the 18th if we could notify the community by pulling the item so it wouldn't remain on the agenda where people would come on the 22nd and then bump it to the next active council meeting, which is October 6th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That would at least give us an alternative if under the circumstance that Council Member Austin mentioned, that there is not clarity at the state yet. If it hasn't been signed and or if the city attorney's office does not have posted online to the agenda the information for the community to review.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because while it's great to show up and have a verbal report from the city attorney giving the community the opportunity to review it 72 hours in advance of the meeting, I feel is critical in getting good community input.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I would hope that the friendly would be accepted that if the city attorney's office has not prepared and posted by noon on Friday of the week of. The 18th, which would be posted for the council meeting on the 22nd, that we would be able to put out a notification to the community and move it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One council meeting so that they have that kind of opportunity because I want throw an educated feedback.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Generally speaking, Mr. City Attorney, wouldn't the material be ready by the 72 hour deadline?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will make every effort to have it back in a timely manner so that it could be heard on the 22nd. If that's the way the motion is going to go, we will definitely do that. The more time we have, obviously, the more thorough we can be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we will bring something back by the 22nd, even if it's to let you know that the you know, the status of HB 266, if for some reason isn't signed by that date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's sufficient. Now I appreciate where you're coming from, Councilmember Mongo, but there are many items that this council takes that are of equal or even greater priority that we have not given that kind of consideration. I know and I trust that the staff does its best to make those documents available within the 72 hour framework'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I trust that they will, or at least a majority of it, and I'm comfortable with them coming back that evening and not postponing it any further.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Than I'd like to make a substitute motion that if it is not prepared and attached by the Friday before that it would be bumped to the following meeting. And while I appreciate that there are many other items that are as important as this, I think that only recently have the neighbors and I started having the discussions about'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the single sheet that's attached within the city clerk's office when staff have not provided a report in advance or when they're planning to provide a verbal report.

        "'speaker_1': 'And we let them know that we do our best to get it in advance. And sometimes it's a verbal report, but a decision or weighing in from neighbors of this magnitude, I feel, is very, very critical.

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So was that a substitution? To be clear?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just so I understand, the substitute motion is to. Aim for the 22nd. But if the information is not posted by noon of the 18th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That the city clerk's deadline is noon of the Friday, before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then, it would automatically be kicked off to one meeting, which would be October the sixth. I think that's the motion, right? Yes. Okay. There is a second on the motion by Councilman Price. So that's a substitute motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me go to Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that is a very reasonable request and I share. Councilman Austin and Councilwoman Mango's concerns. You know, in February, when we voted to have a task force, we also voted on a timeline that, in my opinion, was very unrealistic, which was to come back for a vote in April.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't even know that the task force began meeting that quickly. It just that just things don't happen in that timely of a fashion. And the last time this issue came to us, we had a debate internally whether or not we were willing to extend it two weeks so that a council, all council members could be present'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And and so while I understand the urgency and I know several members of the task force are very interested in the outcome of this, and some may even have a financial interest. I think that it's important to understand that we're talking about a week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two weeks or three weeks and. Assuming that we even voted on this tonight, let's just assume for a moment that we voted on this tonight. Our city staff has asked us in the form of a memorandum and basically told us as council members that they would not be ready to implement anything and that they would need some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'time in order to prepare to bring on this industry. So it's not as though if we get to this two weeks later or even a month later, that people are going to lose out on on some big opportunity because it's going to take some time to put this into motion anyway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we're going to follow the advice of. City staff, which clearly we can ignore that and just mandate them to begin immediate implementation. But I would assume that we're going to be somewhat prudent in how we go about this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think that's a very reasonable request. And I would just ask folks to just step back for a moment and and ask, you know, what all Councilmember Mongeau is saying is she'd like the public to have adequate notice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's reasonable. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I'm going to go to Vice Mayor Lowenthal and then hopefully we can go to the public and then we'll we can come back for a vote. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just briefly, I I do appreciate the opportunity for members to come and speak. I think what we will find is oftentimes and maybe there will be a few new members who have never spoken on this issue that will come forward when this item comes back for but in large part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we can assure ourselves that folks have been engaged longer than any one of us, probably, and and they have had opportunities and they can have that opportunity to come back. And so I ask my colleagues to vote no on the substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. So just as we have the as we have the commenters, please come forward for the public comment. And just as a reminder, kind of where we are and stand up of the motion so that we're all on the same page.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a substitute by Councilman Mongo, which is. Is it additional to the original motion which basically asks if the information is not posted by the 18th?

        "'speaker_4': 'This is a health issue. So I think that's something that does need to be included. I would I would appreciate that, too, if some there was some mention of the health department and assign it to them. Also, the which should be considered is the MPAA and the CAA, which is the are the two governing state legislations now'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that govern patients already. So we don't need to put a whole lot of regulations in regarding the patients at this time. So what I'm asking is, is that that be removed. It's one thing to govern the dispensaries and regulate them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a good thing. But the patients are already governed by it. And there's many things in the draft ordinance it's overreaching. So that should be corrected. The same.

        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm saying I support this motion, but I'm very concerned that it'll just keep being postponed and postponed. People are being harmed. They need this medicine. They shouldn't have to go to Los Angeles or Santa Ana if we can handle it.'",

When we we were operating before, there were all these dispensaries that weren't regulated. Now we're starting from square one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a different situation. I do believe the Long Beach Police Department is mature enough. They can handle 27 or 30 dispensaries. So I do support the motion, but there are a number of considerations we we need to address.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Specifically stations 12, station three, and Station 22. Response time citywide to get a paramedic on scene of a critical call would improve with the new system. And we realized a dramatic reduction in a reliance on automatic aid from Los Angeles County Fire Department and Orange County Fire.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In a year prior to RMD, we relied on L.A. County. Over 200 times to run calls for service in the city of Long Beach. And during the past year of armed implementation, we have only relied on them ten times for assistance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Additionally, we saw a number of enhancements in patient care outcomes and finally, implementation of our M.D. stabilized our budget. The disadvantages of the program centered around the impact of change. The change of deployment would alter a system that had been in place since the early 1970s.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We did not minimize this concern and knew going into initial discussions this would be a hotly contested issue by our union, by neighboring unions in Los Angeles County and other stakeholder groups. For the past three years, the EMS agency has received numerous communications from groups that opposed this change.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Another disadvantage of the program is a reduction in daily sworn staffing. This reduction, which enabled us to meet our budgeted goals, did reduce the number of sworn firefighters on duty each day and caused us to change our standard operating procedures and revise how we respond to certain non-emergency medical service related calls prior to the implementation of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'RMD. Prior to implementation of the program, we engaged in a very robust training effort to ensure our people were well versed on the new program components. We assembled a team of department members to help create the Armed Manual that covered specific operating procedures on various call types not related to EMS that our people face.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We conducted department wide training on the RMD program. We established a lengthened academy for our ambulance operators and increased driver training they received prior to moving to field operations. We continued to solicit feedback from the rank and file to identify potential areas of concern that needed to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we provided continuing education and ongoing review process of the program and the various components. We convened an armed working group to address staff concerns and discuss potential improvements. R&D after all of this was implemented on July 10th, 2014, after over two years of discussion, meetings and preparation with the implementation, we began a two year pilot program'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on the new deployment model. We immediately began the process of collecting data that was required of the pilot program that we agreed to send to the SMB and the agency monthly, talking about how we collect our data. One big component of the R&D program is data collection.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In order to effectively monitor the system, data was required to be sent to the by an emergency medical services agency on a monthly basis. Initially, we had planned on utilizing electronic patient care records, but a decision was made by the EMS Commission prior to the start of the RMD program that we should continue to submit our data'",
        "'speaker_11': 'in the same method in which it had been submitted for the two years of retrospective retrospective excuse me, study material. Our data originates a few different ways. First is a CAD or computer aided dispatch data. Second, the majority of the data that we see that comes from comes from individual emergency medical service or EMS report forms that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'are generated by our field personnel. These forms are manually filled in either by a company officer or captain or the paramedic while on a call for service. This has historically proven to be the most accurate form of data we collect as the information is compiled by the rank and file members in the field and includes a number'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of data sets not found with the CAD data. Lastly, many pieces of equipment used in the field timestamp the data being produced by those machines and for example, Cardiac Monitor has the ability to electronically transmit data directly to a hospital telemetry machine and show real time what paramedics are seeing in the field.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This year, we sent nearly 15,000 emergency medical reports to the DSM-V, an agency to review. These reports were sent over in their raw form, not manipulated or altered in any way. And the Data Safety Monitoring Board evaluated those reports to evaluate our program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This slide shows some key data points that the Data Safety Monitoring Board was reviewing and a comparison between pre RMD and post RMD outcomes. Those areas that are highlighted in green on this slide indicate enhancements in our system over the past year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Next slide. This. Here is a summary of more specific data points that clearly show some enhancements in our system. The response time section at the top. Chest pain, cardiac arrest and trauma are all data sets that were generated by the Data Safety Monitoring Board and show pre RMD and post RMD response times for the first paramedic arrival'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on scene. The second area down below call volumes per rescue shows this is an average of all of our rescue ambulances pre RMD we averaged 13.1 calls per day per ambulance and post RMD 11.7 calls per day and at the bottom are reliance on automatic aid with Los Angeles County pre rmd 292 calls for service and post'",
        "'speaker_11': 'ten calls for service and Orange County 450 calls and post 218 calls for service. Since the inception of the pilot program, we've been in constant contact with the Emergency Medical Services Agency regarding the overall performance of the system and the specific data points being monitored in conjunction with our medical director, Dr. Steve Shea, who is here this'",
        "'speaker_11': 'evening. We have been responsive to any and all questions or concerns that the agency may have. In addition, we have brought forward a number of issues that we felt needed to be adjusted to make our system more effective.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'During the pilot project, we have only received formal communication from the agency on three occasions. Issues raised by the EMS Commission and EMS agency have been shared with the city manager and the City Council and the previous City Council and meetings throughout the pilot project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The first was the first communication we received from the agency was related to an issue we brought to the attention of the agency when we informed them that due to the large number of basic life support or BLS level non-emergent patients in certain areas along beach.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We wanted to put basic life support ambulances into service to address those calls. On the heels of that move, we received a letter from the and the EMS agency stating that that we were not meeting the three minute time differential for arrival of the second paramedic, which was specified in the 407 policy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This specific section of policy states that we need to have a second paramedic arrive within 3 minutes of the first paramedic. 95% of the time, after receiving a letter from the agency stating they were putting our program on a plan for improvement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We met with the director regarding this requirement. We then went before the full EMS commission to discuss this section of policy, and their response was a decision to defer any penalties imposed on the noncompliance of Long Beach Fire Department in meeting this requirement that a one plus one staffed ALS or advanced life support units arriving at the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'scene of an incident within 3 minutes of 95% of each other of the time. And that that we would report back with calculated, budget driven data as to why we couldn't provide more units. One of their questions there was, why can't we just add more ambulances into the system?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The second communication we received came in May. This was a letter that came from the Data Safety Monitoring Board, and it was related to the review of our data. Excerpts from this letter will be shown on the next slide.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And finally, the last piece of formal communication came to us last Wednesday stating that the program would be terminated. And I will discuss this letter in a few slides. A new medical director, Dr. Gachet Hill, was appointed to the position of medical director for the local EMS agency on July 1st, after the retirement of medical medical director'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Dr. Cavanagh, who had been with us since the start of the program. The DSM v letter. This slide shows excerpts from the letter that we received in May of this year from the Data Safety Monitoring Board. This same information was presented to the full EMS commission in June of this year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This, of course, is a very positive letter from the Data Safety Monitoring Board about the RMD program. On August 5th, the newly appointed medical director asked to conduct a ride along to see the R&D program firsthand. This was the third such ride along conducted by a member of the EMS agency over the past year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Medical director Dr. Gachet Hill Road, along at Station one for 4 hours. Following this ride along, the medical director asked for a meeting regarding her observations. On August 13th, we met with the EMS agency and brought up and they brought up numerous concerns with the RMD program, which are now referenced in their letter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We we responded to all issues that they raised at that at this meeting. We're also very clear that our own medical director, Dr. Steve Shea, who is the architect of our paramedic program in Long Beach and who has been our medical director for over 30 years, would be the first person to pull the plug on a program'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that was a risk to public safety or a degradation of patient care. At this point, I'd like to welcome Dr. Steve Shea to come up to the microphone, and he's going to specifically address one component of the letter that was related to the fallouts that specifically deal with medical conditions and medical complaints.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These were items that were put in by the medical doctor, and our medical director wanted to respond to those issues just as way of introduction. Dr. Steve Shea is our medical director. He's the medical director at St Mary Medical Center.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He has been the primary and chief architect of the paramedic program in Long Beach since the early 1970s and has been with us every step of the way through this pilot project up until this point. So with that, Dr. Shea.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've been here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A long time. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've been here a long time, and I've seen this program grow and develop and become. I think the premiere program in all of Los Angeles County, and there's lots of reasons for that. But when we got the termination letter, I was very surprised, too, to actually have gotten the letter and was surprised by some of the language'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the letter. They talked about fallouts and, you know, fallout to me. Sounds like we did something wrong. And when you look at what a fallout really is, we looked at the four or seven requirements that actually we helped develop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the requirements of that was that we guaranteed we'd be having two paramedics in the ambulance transporting Tier one patients. Now, a Tier one patient is somebody that has more likelihood to become unstable and require more treatment than our average patient.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we put that in the 407. We would accomplish that 100% of the time. And we do not accomplish that 100% of the time. And so those all came back as fallouts. Now, we reviewed all the fallout. We sent all the fallouts to the DSM-V.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in my way of thinking, fallout is something where there's an adverse patient outcome. In the fallouts, all the fallouts that we reviewed, we saw no adverse patient outcomes. So even though the numbers that and and we dispute the numbers we got from the county, we actually gave them the reports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I reviewed the reports that they reviewed. I they're their numbers aren't entirely accurate, but there are some fallouts in that. There were cases where two paramedics were not in the back of the ambulance transporting a Tier one patient to the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In most of those cases, the patient improved at the scene, was stable, and there was no need for two paramedics in the back of the ambulance. In our old system. We had two paramedics in the ambulance, but one was driving the ambulance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what we were doing certainly was above and beyond what we had done in the old system. So to call those fallouts, I think, is a little bit of a misnomer. Now. Do I think this system is better than the old system?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I do. And I'll tell you why. We know that we get paramedics to the scene quicker in the new system than we did in the old system. There are a few time sensitive emergency conditions where that makes a difference.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Patients with chest pain. Patients in cardiac arrest, trauma patients. The data from the DSM-V confirmed that in each of those emergencies, we were getting paramedics to the patient quicker than the old system. So I think it's a better system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our numbers for resuscitated cardiac arrest went up significantly. Some people can say that maybe that's not statistically significant because the numbers aren't that big. But if you look at the data, there's a definite trend to more patients being successfully resuscitated under the new system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So do I think it's a better system? Yes, I do. Do I think we should close the system down? No, I don't. I think that. I think the county. Is jumping the gun with their fallout and how they've been analyzed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would like to get a meeting with Dr. Gachet to go over every single one of the fallouts individually. And determine whether or not we really have an issue. I don't believe there is I don't believe we we we have not uncovered one case where a patient was put in jeopardy because we didn't have two paramedics'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the back of the ambulance and the county to this at this time has not given us any as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's kind of my read on the fallouts in and the system, and I still believe it's a better system.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Dr. Shay. So next steps. We do plan to meet with the EMC Commission at their next scheduled meeting to review the letter and discuss transitioning back to the previous model. We will develop solutions to meet fire department budget goals and we will work closely with the city manager and financial management to identify viable solutions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We will comply with the direction provided by the EMS agency and we will revert our system as per their requirements in this letter back to the pre RMD staffing model. With that, I would like to turn it over for to the last slide for Budget Manager Leah Erickson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In regards to the budget impact because we received this notice at this late date in the budget process. We are not recommending reopening the budget process. This termination of our M2, you will have an estimated $1.4 million budget impact to fire and rather than having fire come up with structural service reductions to cover those costs, we have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a three pronged approach. First, we will house fire to make adjustments to minimize the FY16 budget impact within their budget. But then we'll also be tracking the first responder fee revenue that is being received in FY 16 and we'll be using that to help cover the additional costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if those two are not enough, we also recommend reserving 1.4 million of any 515 year end savings. Typically year end, we do have savings that do occur and that money will be a backstop in case there is not enough first responder fee revenue or other reductions in the fire budget to cover these additional costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is the solution for a proposed solution for 16, and any permanent fix will need to be addressed in the FY17 budget process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So mayor, vice mayor, councilmembers would be happy to respond to any questions now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to turn this over to the makers of the motion first. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Mr. Manager, the fire chief and financial services for the report. I will just tell you that I was extremely taken aback last week when we received this information and this news.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that is why I took a lead. And I want to thank Council Member Supernova and you Ranga for for signing on to this supplemental agenda item because it's obviously has a major impact on our governance, our budgeting, and particularly for FY16.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The information that we read from the the County Emergency Services Emergency Medical Services Agency is a 180 degrees different from what was represented to us on August 18th at our budget meeting from the fire department. And so I'm I'm really perplexed here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I appreciate the the detailed report chronicling how we have arrived to this this point. I have been a I think I've been critical of this this model from from day one, because I was concerned about patient care. I and to Dr. Shea's point, I mean, I do appreciate your opinion, sir, and your service to our city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's clear that the the the agency for the county clearly disagrees with your assessment of our program. I do have a couple of questions, and I know there are probably many others behind the rail. But but during the hearing on the 18th, Chief, do you consistently cited reports of the Debris Data Safety Monitoring Board and stated'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that the data indicated that R&D posed no risk to patient safety. However, the EMS agency later indicated the DMA. The SMB monitoring is only one aspect of the evaluation and not reflective of the entire program evaluation. Did any other parts of the evaluation process raise any other red flags along the way for you, as apparently it did'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for the agency staff? Were there any other red flags?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember. As we went through the process, the only other formal red flag that came up was when we were sent a letter from the EMS agency stating that we were not complying with a section of the four or seven policy that stated we would have the first paramedic and the second paramedic arrive within 3 minutes of each'",
        "'speaker_11': 'other. That came to us in the form of a of a letter and a formal kind of plan for improvement. We then went back to the EMS agency and discussed what we would do to to work toward that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We had multiple discussions on that issue. Ultimately, we ended up going before the full EMS commission to discuss that specific issue, to discuss that specific section of the policy and its applicability to any other EMS provider in Los Angeles County, which it was not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And ultimately, the EMS commission, the EMS commission, by by motion and a unanimous vote stated that they didn't want to take that section out of the policy, but they were not going to hold us accountable or punish us for not meeting it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But other than that, the vast majority of the communication we had from the EMS agency over the past year of the program has been positive.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so when was that that when did you get that communication from the MSA?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That was you know, I don't have I we'll look up the exact date of the letter, so I give you the exact date. I don't have it off the topic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Was it within the last month?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, it was it was it was a while back. It would have been. I don't want to give you a I don't want to speculate on the date, but I'll get it for you right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So so in your comments in your report, you also mentioned that there was a four hour ride along. And then after the ride along, there was there was some comments and some concerns raised. Is that true?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Is there any reason why you chose to withhold that information from the council when you were asked about the validity or any any risk with in terms of the armed process moving forward?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'COUNCILMEMBER Well, we've had, as I mentioned over the past year, on three occasions, we've had members of the EMS agency come right along with us just to evaluate or just to watch the program, monitor it, evaluate it. Doctor, the new medical director asked for asked for the ability to go ride along.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She went and rode along. That's a fairly normal practice, not something I would normally bring up to the council. I didn't see any reason to inform the council that the agency was riding along with us on that date.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And back to your previous question, that letter on the on the three minute time differential was sent to us on October 22nd, 2014.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And then I'm also in reviewing the letter, it cites a review of 269 records provided by the fire department in which this patient was transported prior to the arrival on scene of a second paramedic. Okay. And if I understand that letter correctly, the EMS indicated that the the fire department deemed all of those cases to be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'appropriate departure from Tier one transport criteria. Or, in other words, that the patient would be transported by two paramedics. The however, the EMS stated that 48% of the cases, nearly half of them had significant concerns about patient stability in the field.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These cases included acute stroke patients, patients in respiratory distress, trauma patients, children with apparent life threatening events, among others. And the letter stated that these issues are too great to ignore and pose immediate threat to patient safety. First of all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would you agree with that characterization that these cases represent an immediate threat to patient safety? And if not, why not?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, sir, I do not agree with that. I believe that I. I do not agree with that. So of the 268, 269 patients that they're referring to, they cut that number down to 128 that they say were still in question, which amounts to out of the 15,000 reports we sent them over the past year, it amounts to'",
        "'speaker_11': '0.08% of our calls for service. And as Dr. Shea mentioned, each and every one of those calls for service that are questioned as to whether or not they are in in compliance with the policy or out get manually reviewed and manually evaluated by both our education team, by Dr. Shea and by the EMS director.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've had a number of these calls that we've looked at as recently as earlier today. And I'll give you an example of one, a patient, 40 year old male that was presenting with cool and clammy skin with a blood pressure of 80 over 40 at the beach after being stung by a stingray.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the patient had just been stung by a stingray. He was cool and clammy because he was wet because he had just been taken out of the ocean. And 5 minutes later, 10 minutes later, when they reevaluated his vital signs, his blood pressure came back up to a normal limit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The EMS agency said that was a fall out, that it had fallen out of our Tier one transport criteria when in fact, the patient had no medical reason to be transported to the hospital at all. So we evaluate each and every one of those things that are considered fallouts, as does Dr. Shea and the EMS agency.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so, no, I would not say that they just automatically constitute an emergent situation for the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So is the EMS agency considered a credible authority in terms of governance over over help services in the county, other fire departments?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir. The EMS the EMS agency provides all the pre-hospital guidelines that we follow to deliver emergency medical service. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it sounds to me like we have some serious dispute with with this this credible body, and that that raises some some serious concerns with me. I mean, I don't know that we're in a in a position to necessarily take them on as a as a as a city, particularly citing the fact that they they do have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'some regulatory authority. I do have some some some practical questions for you. What is our current staffing level? And are there no firefighters currently in our department to restore these positions, or will it have to be accomplished through overtime?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember the we have enough firefighters to staff the organization. What will happen when we revert back to the to the old system is a number of the people who are in a paramedic position now will not be they will revert back to they will revert back to a firefighter position and lose the they will not be functioning'",
        "'speaker_11': 'as a paramedic in our system anymore. So they are firefighters and they'll just go back into the system the way they were. If you recall an earlier slide, we go from 11 ambulances currently with one firefighter paramedic on it down to eight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we believe we have enough firefighters to manage. And as a system, there could be we'd have to have I'd have to look at that with my deputy chief of operations. But there could be a need for overtime in some places, but I believe we have nothing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in the budget presentation and I believe on August 18th, you know, the plan was to eliminate 24 positions from the budget. Is that that still going to be the plan?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're still going to eliminate 24 positions from our budget. And because I think I ask you to question whether or not the elimination of those positions were tied to the R&D program. And you answered affirmatively.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Actually, no, sir. The elimination of those 24 positions, those 24 positions were related to the daily engine reductions or the brownouts that we were carrying in our budget from a number of years back that had never that had remained in our budget, but had never been filled.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So those positions had nothing to do specifically with R&D.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. So now I'm really confused. And lastly, and I'll let my my colleagues answer their ask their questions. Are we I heard that we're not planning to appeal it, but I saw a communication earlier that we were planning to appeal it or plan to go to the Imus agency to to to challenge this race and ask'",
        "'speaker_7': 'questions about this on September 16th. Is that correct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilman? But we have no plan. We've been informed that there is no appeal process. However, the department and our medical director, Dr. Shea, will be there at the EMS commission because they're going to be giving an update on the fact that we're they're closing down the pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're going to revert back to our old system, at which point we will speak to the EMS commission about our findings throughout the program. But we're not we're not calling it an appeal. We're just going to go meet with them and discuss how we're going to revert back to our old system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Q Mr. GROSS and Lisa, thank you. I think the solutions put forward to mitigate this issue, I think they're they're they're credible options for us to consider as a council. And I just got to say, I'm really disappointed that we are at this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know there were high hopes for this R&D model to be successful and forward for it to be a model for for fire agencies across the state. I still think that our model was unique to Long Beach and and and, you know, even though it was implemented and similar models are under are being practiced in other areas'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the state, none are as large as our department. And the the the the ideal of putting a sworn firefighter on a rig with a non sworn EMT is. It was I think it was it was fatally flawed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And yes, there were challenges to that. But, you know, at the same time, you know, you have to to step out there and be bold sometimes. But at the same time, I'm going to just be very straightforward. When I read this, I felt like I was was misled.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I felt like I was misinformed by by our staff. And that was disappointing to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Don't go there. Thank you, Mayor. I'm seconding this motion. I agree with. With the Councilmember Austin. Either make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the motion is to receive and filed this report and to direct city management, not to appeal the the decision of the Emergency Medical Service Agency.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. This procedure. I too was very disappointed in the letter. Obviously, when this first came up to me last year, I did question the. Pilot program aspect of this of this whole whole thing and wanted to go ahead and and approved it at the time, considering that it was a pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, the last budget hearing that we had with the fire department was that it was moving forward, that it was budgeted fully as a pilot project. And yet this letter says they want to go back into contingency to your contingency plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's clearly stated here, I didn't see a contingency plan in here. So I'm guessing that the contingency plan is a reversion to pre rmd service levels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Council member. Yes, that's true. We sent email communication, a memo type communication to the EMC Agency as part of the creation of the governing document of this program. That that basically said it would be the responsibility of the fire department, the city manager, and ultimately the city council determined to determine how we would revert back to a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'previous deployment model should we be required to do it. We we didn't get very specific in that in that communication with the county because we didn't want to relinquish the control of this city council or the city manager or the fire department administration to make decisions on how we deploy our resources.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's that's good. However, when it comes down to the budget, we're it's not there. I mean, we now have a hole of 1.4 million that we're looking at. Financial management is proposing a a fix, if you will, looking at the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's that? I misplaced it near the end here. The. First responder fee using those in addition to any savings that we have at the end of the year. And then some other I guess some other fees that will be addressed out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's my that's that's my problem. That's my concern, is that now that the pilot program basically has been terminated, from what I understand, there is no appeal process to this. So we're stuck with a pilot program that did not work and and without a budget to fix it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So now we're looking at trying to fix a hole in in the fire department's budget to get to revert back to a process that we should have. Basically, I think prudence would have told us to keep that budget in there somewhere in case or in the event of an emergency where this pilot program failed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we didn't do that. So I'm very concerned with with that aspect of what we're dealing with today. So I'm checking in this motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember, I do want to point out, though, we're no worse shape off than we were when this started because we had a $1.5 million hole. This program backed it up. So we're just back to where we started. So rather than eliminating an engine or a truck, we tried to do this program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So no one has that intent to make that recommendation. Now, you heard what Mr. GROSS and Ms.. Erickson are saying to to deal with the 1.5 million. But we had a $1.5 million hole, whether we did this program or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come tomorrow. You are wrapped up. Okay. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate the presentation tonight by city staff on this issue. I know that you have been working diligently since you received. The letter on last Wednesday. So I appreciate your efforts in trying to update us. And I get the sense from the the presentation tonight that all parties, in terms of city staff, are in agreement'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that there was a good faith basis in regards to the implementation and the operation of the project. And I respect that and I appreciate that. And while I appreciate the opinions regarding the effectiveness of the model and some viewpoints, I will say that that conclusion is very much in dispute at this juncture, and the authors of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'report are not here to defend their findings. And so while I appreciate the position that our staff has taken in, our leadership has taken in regards to the effectiveness of the model and the foundations that led to the findings of the EMS report maybe being different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are now in a situation where we as a city are in receipt of a letter from a regulatory agency that raises some very serious concerns about patient care standards. And that is that's the reality. That's the reality that we find ourselves in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's very important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At this juncture that when I wanted to offer a friendly, although it was implied in the presentation, that we immediately cease the R&D model in light of the findings that have been given to us in writing and appear to in no uncertain terms, indicate a concern from a regulatory agency regarding the safety of this model for potential'",
        "'speaker_3': 'patients. So I'd like to offer that friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Except hey, there's a motion and a friendly that was accepted. Councilman Price, did you have anything additional? I have. Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In regards to the funding. You know, I think we as council members do our very best, each and every one of us, to understand areas where we don't have expertize in regards to staffing. And, you know, some of the data that you presented tonight, it's very natural for you to present this data.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's this is the language that you speak. But to us, many of us don't have that expertize. And so the big picture issue, I would say, and I don't mean to speak for my colleagues, but I think we look to our city leaders to come up with the innovative ways to resolve this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is now an issue that we've all found ourselves in a predicament. And how we respond to this predicament is, you know, as a member of the city council in this body, I would be looking to our city leadership, specifically our city manager and his team, to help come up with innovative ways to resolve this issue that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we now are faced with. And so. I think while I will be open, I'll be open to hearing what some of the ideas and and thoughts of where the funding will come from. And while I appreciate our financial management team coming up with some temporary fixes, I think this presents more of a long term issue that we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'going to have to think about, because moving forward, we had all hoped and expected. And I. I do believe that. The fire chief and city management staff believed that the pilot program was something that was going to be well-received and something that was going to be a long term methodology to be used by the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we've based a lot of budget projections on that. And now that has changed. That reality has changed. So, you know, I'd be interested in finding out how we deal with this tomorrow, how we deal with it in FY 16 and what the plan is long term moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I look really I look to you for guidance. I look to our city management team for guidance in that regard. This is your area of expertize we're looking for from direction for we're looking for direction from you as a team and specifically our city manager who who helps guide us in all things impacting the city through'",
        "'speaker_3': 'his various department heads. So I want to thank you for the presentation. And again, you know, regardless of of what happens in resolving some of the findings and whether or not there is some agreement on those disputes in regards to the foundations of the either parties opinions, I think all of that is is to be discussed at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'some future time because at this juncture, we have a report that we need to deal with and act upon. And and I believe we're doing that by tonight's action. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. A Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayor, can we have the friendly repeated?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. Mr. City Turner. We actually repeat the whole motion as it stands.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mayor members of the Council, the motion, as I understand it, by council member Austin and seconded by Councilmember Iraq, is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To receive and file the report and not to appeal the decision and that the friendly amendment was to terminate the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'R&D program immediately. I would like some clarification on immediately, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The letter indicated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By October 1st and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That if more time was needed, the city needed to notify the department by I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think it was September 15th.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, I certainly am not the person to answer that question of whether what is immediate and what is immediately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I will try to clarify that the intent of my motion was immediately as and as of tomorrow. And the reason for that is because although we may want to be in compliance with the letter, which allows us some time, the letter also has a finding that says we're practicing a methodology that is potentially causing patient care'",
        "'speaker_3': 'risks. And I just don't know how we continue. Now, we're on notice in writing of a potential issue in the manner that we're delivering medical care. So I guess I would maybe. Ask the city attorney, do you believe that it would be prudent for us in light of these findings to continue the methodology, even though the regulatory'",
        "'speaker_3': 'agency is giving us time to comply?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I guess the question I would have is, is what could be done? Practically speaking, how can they convert back to the other program? And I would leave that, obviously, to the experts in the in the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the direction that I'm taking from this, as I understand the motion, is to do it as expeditiously as possible, protecting the safety of the individuals. I, I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Also think that there is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Credible evidence and an argument to be made that, you know, there's a disagreement with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Some of the decisions and the letter itself.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the letter itself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Isn't evidence of specific conduct or instances. It's where they had concerns. And I don't have enough of the specifics and each one would be factually based. But if we had to go through each one of those, we would have to do that and we would have obviously someone looking at those two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I and I understand that and I appreciate. But wouldn't we cease the practice and then discuss the disputes and then. I mean, to me, it seems like we would the prudent approach would be to cease a practice that is potentially detrimental.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, that's that's my my thoughts on it. But again, I think your wording is probably better as expeditiously as practical, perhaps under the circumstances, because I do understand there are some staffing, major staffing issues that need to be worked out, and I respect that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the intent behind the friendly is to. Respond to the findings. If we want to take them on or challenge them, that's another thing. I don't think this is the time and place to do it because I think the prudent thing to do is to err on the side of caution.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If I can interrupt. We have no intention of. Of appealing. We have no intention of going up against the commission on anything. So we're accepting this totally 100%, and we're going to begin immediately. I can promise you that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We definitely I've just talked to the chief. We will have it back to the previous situation by October 1st. If we can do it before October 1st, we certainly will. But again, I just want to point out that we have no intention whatsoever about revisiting anything with the commission.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We simply want to talk to them about putting going back to the. They wanted us to talk to you about going back to the the old system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Had something because I just want to weigh in, Mr.. Mr.. West. And I just want to just add to that that I am 100% in agreement with that. Just for the record, there is no appeals process. I personally talked to the medical director today, both the medical director as well as her boss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there is no appeals process. We're not going to appeal. I think that they're aware that the chief and his team are planning to attend the meeting, in particular to share how they would kind of discontinue and go back to the old system by October one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the plan has always been to go and go back to the system for the letters request, but there is absolutely not going to be an appeal and there is no even if the city want it to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's not a process. And so that's not happening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And thank you, Mayor. And I do want to point out, too, though, the EMS agency, certainly they've invested a lot in this program, too, and they want to talk to us as we unwind it, because they certainly want to review.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They want to come back and interview our paramedics, interview our employees and talk to everybody in the department over the next three, four or five months on what was strong about the program, what was weak about the program.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So because they're all about change as well and they see change coming to this is just a program they couldn't get behind. And we are accepting that and recognizing that. And we'll work with them after the program's concluded, because they do want to do a an analysis of the program and publish it and what went right, what'",
        "'speaker_10': 'went wrong. So other fire agencies can look at this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think and Mr. West, thank you for sharing that, because I think that's an important point. Again, we're not involved in the the details to the level that the city manager is and certainly the fire chief. And so, you know, maybe there's an aspect of this that they feel most strongly about that might have been modified'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or changed or tweaked. I don't know. I just want to make sure that we are respectful of the process and their intent and that we are not doing anything that could potentially appear to be ignoring.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can assure you that that will not be the case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. And again, like I said at the outset, I really do believe there was a good faith basis. And I do believe that the fire chief received information along the way that was encouraging. I know that for a fact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, the parts of the letters that he's shared. Prove that. However, the decision, as unexpected as it may have been, has caused us to be in a bit of a predicament, and we need to respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think in the most prudent, cautious and conservative manner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you for the presentation and the proposed budget solution. I clearly see that some work has been been been done in the last few days since we've gotten this notice. My top concern is the safety of our residents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And and I want to get down to some facts. I'd like to get more clarity on this particular budget solution. So to begin, I personally I know that we strive in almost everything we do budgetary to be we tossed around words like prudence and fiscally conservative.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we've learned a good lesson. Well, I think the entire city of Long Beach has learned a good lesson that we can't if we don't control our own fate, we can't gamble by putting the lives of our residents into the hands of some other regulatory agency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so to get to the specific questions I have number one in the presentation today, I there were a few questions I had. So first it references that we were not the first we were not the first agency to implement this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it says that Los Angeles I think it says Los Angeles implemented the program. Is that correct? Or Los Angeles approved the program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A councilmember in 1999, then fire chief Mama Autry actually brought this brought a similar version of our M.D. before the city council and the mayor there. It was approved. It was taken over to the EMS commission, where it was also approved.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they had approval to move forward on it. It was going to be a localized deployment only in the San Fernando Valley area. And ultimately the Los Angeles City Fire Department never went into that deployment model.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the presentation, so it was approved, but it was never implemented or tested?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct. Now, not in Los Angeles County, no.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the presentation is misleading and makes it just at first view. I'm thinking that it just says it says where did it come from? R&D not invented. In Long Beach, 1999, City of Los Angeles Fire Department received approval.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just at a glance. I would want clarity to see, to say it was a received approval, but it was never implemented or tested. So this just appears just a bit misleading. I think secondly and I see in here there's some reference to some communication with the Data Safety Monitoring Board or or or is it, I think, August'",
        "'speaker_9': '13th, some conversation with the medical director. I know that two weeks ago I asked the question on whether we had a sense on whether or not the county would reject this program and what would be our contingency plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then I believe the response that we got was, Councilmember, I don't have any indication that the county would step in given the data that was submitted to them over the past year and given the data safety monitoring boards letter that they submit to the full EMS commission, I don't have any indication that the agency wouldn't look'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at the data and see clearly that the program is effective based on the data. So I think there's I'm unclear on to today's presentation says that that there was some conversation but last week it it says that there wasn't some conversation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the letter the letter that came in says that the agency conducted multiple ride alongs with different agency staff from July 2014 to August 2015 and identified major concerns regarding training, mentoring, oversight and system performance. And while some of these are expected at the beginning of the pilot, the persistence after a year is most concerning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These issues have been brought to your attention on multiple occasions, most recently during our August 13, 2015 meeting. And then and then it goes on to say that because my original question was about the contingency plan, and what I heard was that it's really not necessary to have a contingency contingency plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it says here that per March 14, 2014, the contingency plan for City of Long Beach paramedic pilot staffing model was referenced. So what I would have preferred to what the more clear, direct answer would have been, there is a plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not very it you know, it hasn't been fully developed, but there was a plan submitted until 2014 because that was the question. So I guess I'd like for you just to respond to these three areas where I left the last council meeting with some certainty that there was no indication from EMS.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But then the letter references, not only an indication, but also that we submitted a contingency plan. If you could just respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'COUNCILMEMBER The August 13th meeting that we had came on the heels of of a phone call, the new medical director, she did her ride along. She ended up making a phone call to Dr. Steve Shea, basically stating that she had some concerns, wanted to have a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We set up the meeting on August 13th and a number of my staff went and met with the EMS agency. I need to point out clearly that this was a fairly common practice, even with the previous medical director.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We. Since July 10th of 2014 to that August 15th, August 13th, excuse me, it was fairly common for them to have a question or concern come up at the EMS agency and we would mobilize our staff. Sometimes I would go some most of the time it was our staff would respond out to the agency.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They would sit down and they would engage each other on whatever the issue was, whether it be a specific data set issue or response time issue or whatever. Those meetings were very, very common. And so this meeting that we had scheduled for August 13th was we viewed it as a very common practice.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This was consistent with what we had dealt with all the way along when we left that meeting on that day. Everybody in the room, including Dr. I'm speaking for Dr. Shay is including Dr. Shay. And my entire staff felt that, yes, we still have some unresolved issues as we have had in the past.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we're going to continue to engage in discussions with the EMS agency, agency to ensure that they are in a comfortable place. We're in a comfortable place and we will continue to move forward. When I told you at the City Council meeting at my budget presentation that I had no expectation that based on the data we had'",
        "'speaker_11': 'submit to the county, that we would be in a situation where they would terminate our program. I didn't I didn't use those words there, but that was honest. We were in the midst of discussions that were consistent with probably 15 other meetings we had had over the previous year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I had no reason to believe when we walked out of that room that the that I would we would receive a letter a week later or a week and a half later that would terminate our program. Going back to the contingency plan, the contingency plan was merely, we felt, a simple kind of budgeting exercise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If we had a $1.5 million hole in our budget that we used at that time, or $1.4 million budget, and we created armed so as to avoid a future engine closure or closing another ambulance if if that system were to be unwound.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We viewed that as a simple kind of budgeting exercise for us. And we would then be faced with a $1.4 million hole in our budget, at which point I would bring my staff together. We would work with the city manager, we'd work with financial management to determine feasible solutions to the budget hole that existed if they were'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to unwind the program. So the contingency letter that we sent back to the agency, while not overly detailed and specific we felt was sufficient enough to give us the ability to determine what we wanted to do, should that should that situation ever arise.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, Chief, I think I understand the intent, and I think it was all well-intended, and I do understand the miscommunication on. I asked for certain things, but I think you were asking for you interpret it as did you receive anything outside of the norm?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I get that as well. As a leader, you have to make those calls. But I think I think we all understand that there are ramifications for the decisions City Council makes. I think we're elected to make those decisions with full information, not necessarily filtered information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We'd like to just know that whether there was communication or not so we can make, you know, an informed decision on our own. And that's just my opinion, I would say, next, I think the way that's been framed tonight is that this this has been a program that the city of Long Beach has openly welcomed and that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this you know, this comes as a surprise. But the truth is, I've been in every city council meeting the last five years for the most part, and this has been controversial since day one. And so in that said, I know that there have been very vocal opponents and the rank and file I know that certain council members'",
        "'speaker_9': 'have expressed concerns with this program. And I understand your role as a leader and I totally understand the budget ramifications. My question is, what have we done over the last two years? Have we had any specific outreach in terms of joint labor management meetings to meet and consult on an informal basis, on an ongoing basis about this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'program so that you can bring the rank and file on on board so that maybe we wouldn't have had this this this sort of outcome. So has there been some ongoing joint labor management discussions about this program?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember We, as I mentioned in my presentation, we we had seven specific meetings where we discussed the RMD implementation and the specific effects of that of this program. As we went into the program during the period of the program's implementation, we've had a number of labor management meetings scheduled, which the labor group has canceled or not showed'",
        "'speaker_11': 'up on about three months ago. We actually it was almost three months ago, right about three months ago under Chief Rose Leadership, he established a working group within the Department of Members of all ranks to come in and offer their opinions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What we wanted to know through that. We knew what the data says. We know what the the call the response times are. We know what the outcome data says as as I showed you in the presentation. But we wanted was more of kind of an experiential.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Employee satisfaction how they feel about the program and we were going to put to see if we could identify some themes that we could put together and address with the input of, of the work, the actual people who are doing the work in the stations we have at this point, those those groups are still functioning at at'",
        "'speaker_11': 'this point, we may be best suited to have them turn their direction on to what the department looks like going forward into fiscal 17 or something else will continue to utilize that. But yes, we've done we've made numerous attempts to reach out and in a collaborative manner ask for and solicit input from all stakeholders in the organization'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So I think and so I think it's in just as much in your interest and our department's interests that we that we build and cultivate that relationship with the rank and file and not necessarily leave it up to the union to attend certain meetings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This isn't necessarily about the the union. I think this is we bet on this. And we left it our relationships up to a non-binding board when there was essentially a number of individuals who could have canceled this program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think considering how fluid and how volatile this program was, we should have we should moving forward, work on that rank and file relationship because it matters. Employee morale certainly matters. And it actually was represented here in this in the letter employee morale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would that's my suggestion moving forward now regarding the budget. I see that there are budget solutions that restore the a million and a half hole that R&D filled. Now. If we were to return to pre armed levels, how many rescues are in place at the two 2013 pre Ahmadi levels as opposed to today?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember there currently we have eight advanced life support rescue ambulances in excuse me we have 11 advanced life support rescue ambulances and service. When when we revert back to the old system, we will we will have eight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So again, the the budget for the presentation today, if the question wasn't specifically asked, I think that the public might have saw it as we have a solution to where there's no service impacts. And that's not true. There will be at least three there will be three taken out of service which it which have major budget, major'",
        "'speaker_9': 'impacts to the quality of life of our residents. And I think that's something we need to just be upfront about and address. So that said, in terms of now that we're going back to this baseline of eight. What will be our process for deploying those eight and making sure that we that we have as as in as'",
        "'speaker_9': 'efficient a program as possible or a process as possible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember over as we move forward over the next few weeks, what we will do is we will utilize our run modeling software systems that we've used traditionally over the past ten years to make data driven decisions. We typically use them, unfortunately, for when we're going to select something to take out of service.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In this case, we will apply all of our historical call volumes into the run modeling systems, and we will make decisions on where it's not only about rescue ambulances, because we're going from 11 rescue ambulances down back down to eight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But right now, we currently have a firefighter paramedic on every fire engine in the city. And we're going to take that back down to only nine engines in the city. So we will use our run modeling software to determine where those paramedic assessment engines should be and also where those rescue ambulances should be in order to meet'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the needs of the community to the best of our ability when we move forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So as I understand it, what you just said, we're not going to use some methodology from the past and 2013 methodology, but we're going to use data from today current data to justify how we implement this model.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember That's correct. I mean, the data from a year and a half ago in the fire service tends to change constantly, which is why we constantly evaluate it. And because this is a big change to go go back to a system with fewer resources in it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're going to need to reevaluate the existing data, the best up to date data that we have to determine. We're placing our resources where they need to be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So it's fair to say that whatever happens now may not be the exact same deployment strategy as it was in 2013.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's quite possible. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I will I will agree with that. I think there's no magic wand to solving this. I think that we we need to look at this as we're going back to rebuild our system. We're going down eight and going to rebuild our system the right way based on today's data.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're going to be upfront and honest about how we build that. And we're going to, you know, and acknowledge that we do need to make investments again in our fire department. So those are my statements. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I have a few questions myself. Of course. First, why did we believe that there was an appeal process? I understand yesterday there was mention of an appeal and now there's no option for that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Counselor. That was probably my problem. So this all just hit us pretty fresh last Thursday. So we thought there was an appeal process. I assume there was one. And as I delved into a deeper, I discovered there was not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And then next question, which it says budget adjustments will be made, of course. Will they be in addition to the 24 eliminating the 24 vacant positions? I mean, what else are we looking at in terms of budget implications for the fire department at this time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez, the fire department is tasked with trying to find ways to reduce their cost to minimize the impact of the 1.4 million. But we are not asking them to make like a fire truck eliminations or other other types of service impacts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we really believe that the the mass vast majority of this will be covered by the first responder fee revenue and if not that, the backstop of the year and savings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And if for any reason that doesn't isn't sufficient, is there another idea?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The so the we're recommending 1.4 million be set aside at year end 15 as the backstop to cover the additional costs. And so that that would assume like $0 came in with first responder fee. And we do know that there will be some revenue coming in with first responder fees since that has been approved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then last point here. So I see in the letter it says no effective mechanism to aid high risk. And also mentions data collection is not robust enough. But then in ours, of course, it says it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So where is the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In that sense? Where is the confusion or where is the difference? Because we see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That that's a huge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Difference. And I don't know how we work through that and still believe that that's a good model for us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember with this with the first question specific to an inability to identify high risk patients, nobody in my command staff, nobody in my in my education team, in EMS and even my medical director have the slightest idea what that is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What it refers to, we have no idea. We are baffled by that statement completely. The the robust data collection we believe that that is referring to. If you recall, prior to implementation of RMD, we had talked about going to an electronic patient care reporting system.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In fact, we were all kind of ramped up to do that. We were ready to go. But just prior to implementation of our M.D., the EMS Commission came back to us and said, We want you to continue to provide your data to us the same way prospectively as you have retrospectively.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we for an apples to apples comparison, we want you to collect your data the same way going forward. So we stopped the electronic patient care reporting in our last meeting with the the director of the agency, Kathy Chidester.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She pretty much she pretty much came right out and said that the way that we're collecting our data, the pen and paper reports did not provide them she felt did not provide them, and an ability to kind of query information out of the data fast enough.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we believe that that line in that letter is basically saying that they would like to see us move to electronic patient care reporting or whoever else is going to do this program, use an electronic means of communicating that data to the agency.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's what we believe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. And then. Okay. All my other questions were answered. I will just touch on the point that Councilwoman Price and Councilmember Richardson mentioned, and it is the relations between the rank and file and management.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I can't stress that enough. I know we know that there's issues there. And I just would hope that I think some of this could have been resolved on maybe the the back end if we would have had better relations between the two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think I would ask that our city management staff really step up to be able to be that liaison in between, because I think it's very important. Now we're put in a situation where on paper and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whatever the case is, it just doesn't look.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good. And now we have the perception that we've been we have a model in place that just hasn't worked out. And whatever side we're on, it's this is now the reality that we're faced with. And so I would just really stress that somewhere along the line that we're working on that relationship somehow, some way, I think it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'very important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. You know, I think everyone kind of realized that the public safety is our most important, you know, priority to the local government, the city of Long Beach. You know, I'm always supporting our firefighters and our police because I think they do a great job and the safety, you know, to protect our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I've seen how hard that these Long Beach firefighters and the police department work. You know, so the first firefighters and the paramedic California then I am proud to support at any and all times. But. When the chief first proposed the Earth M.D. program to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the city council. I have some concerns. In my opinion, our previous EMR system with the two professional firefighters and paramedics response to each serious medical call was working very well. But along with the rest of the city council was assured that the new AMD program would save our city money that would not be diminished and the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'quality of care would provide to our residents. In fact, we were all told that the AMD program would actually improve our emergency medical response system. And because of the cheap shots I supported and proposed our M.D. plan, as did a majority of the City Council in the Art AMD program, has been in effect for, I think, more'",
        "'speaker_5': 'than two years now. And throughout this time all I've heard from the fire chief is that the program was working well. And now we found out that this is not true. I am disappointed. And sadly, by this transfer, I have lost trust and confidence because the fact that all we asked for, each one of you, you know'",
        "'speaker_5': ', top assistance is the true. And that says an opportunity like that, especially we're dealing with safety and protection. I think the truth is the most important thing. You know, the L.A. County Emergency Medical Services Agency canceled the R&D because it had failed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And let me read just a few of the lines from the letter sent to Chief DAVIES, director of As Agency. You know, the RDM has created an environment that is not conducive and good patient care. Rescue ambulance are being shipped with a newly trained paramedics and EMT who has very limited experience.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I could go on, but why should I? Because we've heard most of this tonight. Colleagues. I am disappointed that I am even in this position tonight made of the proposed project never measured up to the promise made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not interested in hearing any more of the same things tonight and trying to say that program. So I think it's time for us to terminate R&D once and for all and get back to the system that provides first class care for the people of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Marie Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I know there has been a lot that's said today, and I wanted to thank my colleagues for articulating their thoughts on the position that we're in right now. I especially want to thank staff having been on the council almost as long as council, actually a little couple of weeks longer than Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I recognize my role in in this, and I will reiterate what Councilwoman Pryce stated, which is we look to our staff, our department heads and our city manager to come up with strategies, especially during the horrible budget times that we experience, to come up with strategies and ways to close our deficit, our budget deficit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we provided parameters for each department. And the chief came forward with a model that, while it may have been unique to Long Beach for a Long Beach's history is not necessarily unique in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe we did this in earnest and that the staff did it in earnest and also did it in good faith, as Councilwoman Pryce mentioned. And so what I hope I know that we have shared a lot of frustration this evening, and it's rightfully placed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, I don't dispute that. I think our challenge today and what I hope that we can focus on going forward, we have a week and a half, two weeks before the charter requires us to pass the budget. While Ms..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ERICKSEN indicated that this does not impact our current budget process structurally, we do have to look forward. Councilwoman Pryce articulated that very, very well. Looking forward, our obligation is to work with our department head, work with our city manager, and ensure that we have a structural solution to this and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'While it doesn't necessarily have to be visited tonight, we did earlier in the Budget Oversight Committee have a short discussion on this. And as it is the case with any other department, the department will have to manage any deficit that comes up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So and I say that just to acknowledge my role in all of this, my personal role in all of this, there is no city staff versus council leadership. This is this is all of us. And we find ourselves in this position.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would like us to be focused on doing, again, exactly as Councilwoman Price indicated. Let's move forward. Let's terminate the pilot. I believe it was a good effort. I believe in our data. I don't want to dispute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our own staff information at this time, I don't think that's that's healthy to do that. And I also don't want to go line for line into what the letter indicated. I that's not what we are called to do today or call to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're called to move forward in a very judicious way. And so I support Councilwoman Price's friendly. We will move forward. And I look forward to the next couple of weeks hearing about the three prong plan that Ms..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Erickson laid out for how we will manage this deficit if there is a deficit after we look at the first responder fee within the department, because we don't need a reminder that we do not have resources in the remaining 20% of the departments to extract any deficit that comes from this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This will have to be managed by the department. And so. To the fire. Chief, I want to thank you for coming forward with. What I believe is still a good effort and coming forward tonight in sharing your thoughts on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I look to you to get us through this and figure out how we're going to manage our deficit. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But thank you. Jason, your comment?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, I was going to say thank you, vice mayor. The the reality is and I just I feel I need to say this. This is this is a profound disappointment for me and my staff as well. And the men and women in the fire department that worked so very hard on this, my entire command staff, the deputy'",
        "'speaker_11': 'chiefs, the assistant chiefs, our nurse educator, our director of education, the all the educators there worked very, very hard to make this program successful. Unfortunately, as a result of the letter from the EMS agency, we will revert back to the previous program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that's that's okay. But I don't want to diminish the work, the good work that our folks did. We took a very bold step at a very uncertain time, given our budget, given a series of reductions that impacted our operational capability.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I just don't want to minimize the impact and the chance that our folks took to do the right thing for the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank you for saying that. I do want to state that I believe every day the good men and women of fire show up every single day to do right by our residents. And they do it not in consideration of any budget model or any particular model, but they do it because they're doing right'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by our residents. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'll be very brief, but I do think it's very important, given the the time that. Staff and the chief and his command staff have put into this project just to say one thing, and that is we consistently ask our department heads to look for innovative ways to deal with our budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you did that. And I know there's a lot of department heads who are sitting in this council chamber tonight, and I don't it would be a shame if even one of them walked away from this and thought, I'm not going to try anything new.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because of a risk of what might happen. That would be a shame. And I say that. And when things like this happen, I mean, you can really only analogize them to your own life experience. And I can't tell you how many times I personally have gone to court and a judge has given a ruling or a jury'",
        "'speaker_3': 'has done something. And I've come back to my colleagues and said, I have no idea where that came from. That was totally unexpected. And there's a disappointment there. And I and I completely get that. But that doesn't mean I don't keep trying innovative things and ways to do things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, that may be a very lame analogy, but I say it because we have a lot of department heads who are sitting in the council chambers. And I want you to know that personally when we say please think of innovative ways to help us with this problem, I speak only for myself when I say I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mean that meaningfully and authentically. It's not just lip service. It's not like try something new and if it doesn't work out, shame on you for trying something new. I'm not going to say that. The bottom line is, and I agree with the vice mayor that, you know, we don't want to be in a position where we're going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'line by line because it's a disputed issue. You know, there are very few facts that are undisputed in this right now at this time. Maybe that will change in the future upon further discussions with the entities, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The one thing I will say, and I respectfully I don't even know that I disagree, but I will say that if in fact, there is going to be a necessity for a budget. Cut. Let's say that are you know, the only thing that I would change is, you know, we try innovative programs and we have a definitive'",
        "'speaker_3': 'contingency plan. If it doesn't work out, here's what we're going to do. I know that we now have a plan that Ms.. Erickson has articulated that seems great, and I'm very hopeful that that works out for us. But if in fact, it doesn't and cuts are necessary, I will say, speaking very personally, I cannot imagine that I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would support any further cuts to public safety. I'm just going to and I may be alone, a lone council member on that voting on my own, but I cannot imagine that I would support any cuts to our police department, our fire department, including our lifeguard services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just can't imagine a scenario where I just think that everyone is operating on a bare bones level right now. And so I would be interested if there is going to be cuts to look at where else cuts might come from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because, you know what, maybe we put off our fleet program. Maybe we I mean, I'm not I'm not saying suggesting that. I'm just saying we need to look at please, nobody nobody from Fleet get upset. I'm definitely not suggesting that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we as a city have to work together to get through these next few years of tough times. And we have tried the proportional share model. It's it's working. There's data that supports it. But maybe as a result of this predicament, we need to do something different for a few years to make sure that we're keeping up'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the public safety standards that we need to keep up. Maybe we need to cut more in administrative resources. I don't know. But I'm just speaking personally on my own behalf that I would put up a very strong opposition to any further cuts for the next few years of our fire department and our police department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just think that those are two areas where we need you more now than ever. So that's just, again, total personal opinion on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Just a couple more questions that that I forgot to ask. So. One of them. What is our what, chief? What would you say would be your timeline to evaluate and get back to the council and to form for your approach to deployment moving forward?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, Councilmember, we have already started having these discussions. We will run our system, ah, run modeling system here over the next the remainder of this week and get into it next week. There's a system that we have, a process that we're going to have to go through in addition to determining where the resources go.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we're talking about rebidding. We're going to have to rebid the entire department, move people all around to different places. We're going to have to engage in a meet and confer with the union. We're going to have to talk about station moves where you move the apparatus, all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So at this point, I mean, the process, the earliest we can even consider being ready to go or being able to articulate to you what's going to happen is probably, I would say, October 1st.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that was problematic about that date. And thank you for for clarifying all the work that needs to be done to actually explain that to the Council. The challenges, the budget, the next budget will be adopted by then, and I'm not entirely sure that I want to move forward with the next budget until I actually have certainty'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and clarity on what our staffing models are going to be once the new fiscal year. And just another question we have. How much does one rescue cost now? And I remember the figures back in back a couple of years ago, but what do they cost today?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's about $1.1 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': '1.1 million. And then and then are we still moving forward with our academy and how much does that cost?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We were budgeted just a little over $1,000,000 for Academy. We're in the process of of interviewing candidates for that academy. But we'll make a determination based on attrition months down the road as to whether or not that's going to be needed at this point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So so the the the evaluation, is there any way you can speed that up so we can get that done, say, in a week?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Councilmember I don't think that's going to be possible. We want it to be accurate, which means we're going to have to load the system with a lot of data and rely on our contract partners from Deccan to put that together.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I don't think we'd be able to put that together in a week and have it be accurate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, so so what? You'll get back to us October one and then so we won't know when we approve this budget, what our staffing model is going to going to look like. Okay. That's enough for me to digest at this point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Thank you, Chief, for the presentation. I'd also like to thank Council Member Price for articulating that brilliant legal analysis of where we are right now without any legal. And she had four days to do that without any legal background.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Last Friday, we're under a deadline. We had to have this item in by noon, and I had to make that same decision in 5 minutes. And I guess I was just lucky. Our guest. Right. But that was a point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I thought this letter was incredibly serious. And to me, this item here simply states, what is plan B and how much will it cost? That's what we're here for tonight. I don't want to look back at how we got here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd also like to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing up the issue of morale. My dad was a Long Beach firefighter, so I do have a little bit of an understanding of how important that is. Very few jobs in this world other than the military may be do the employees live together?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And morale is a critical piece. So I agree with Councilmember Richardson that we need to get that fixed very quickly. I guess other than that, I do have a couple of questions. I guess, to Dr. Shea's point about that he would like to talk to the medical director.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My big question is if we can get a system in place where that happens instantaneously, because I know it seemed like a quick timeframe, but that was ten days that we lost where, you know, then it just all came crashing down.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It seems like if there were questions there and maybe you didn't have a heads up, that it was that this serious. But I see some room for improvement in the medical director of Long Beach speaking to the EMS agency, maybe directly and and more often.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And other than that, I think that just just moving forward here, my other concern last Friday was the budget, because it's not completed. That was my other thought is how do we fix this? Councilmember Price says she can't imagine any more cuts and she still has three fire engines in her district.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As I pointed out weeks ago, my district council district four is the only district in Long Beach without a single fire engine. Guess what? I can't make any more cuts there. It's just not going to work. Okay? Yep.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. 414 and 22. Okay. So, anyway, that's. That's all I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. At this time, we go to public comment on the item and I'll come back to the council. Any public comment on the item? Seeing no public comment on the item. Then I'll come back to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think any more public no more council comment at this time. There is a motion on the floor which is to receive and file and also to. You essentially eliminate the program? There's no appeal. I mean, there isn't an appeal anyways, but I think that's the the nature of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was an also a friendly by Councilman Price and Mr. Parker. You want to just repeat it one last time so we all know what we're voting for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Certainly, Mayor, members of city council, the motion to receive and file the report and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As you mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Not to appeal the decision of the EMS agency and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To terminate the program as and I believe, as the chief has indicated, as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Before we vote, I'd like to ask for a friendly amendment. Councilman Austin I think waiting a month is a long time, but I get it. It takes that much time. So I'd like a weekly update on where we are in this process, because I'd like to know I'd like to track this as we approve this budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Would you accept that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm actually I will accept that because I think in light of the fact that we are moving forward with our budget situation here and we're trying to approve a budget in the next few weeks, it's it's important that we have as much information regarding this situation as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just wanted to clarify the not appealing means. I was really trying to to to emphasize the point that, you know what? Let's let's let this go. Let's let's not go back and contest this with the emergency in any way and let's move forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do agree with Vice Mayor Lowenthal. There's no future in the past.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Members, who's going to cast your votes?'",
