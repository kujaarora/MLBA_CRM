    "Recommendation to receive and discuss an Overview of the Proposed Fiscal Year 2017 Budgets for the following Departments: Harbor, Water, and Civil Service; and": [
        "'speaker_0': 'So that is the the order. It's going to be a longer night, but it's budget season and that's kind of how it goes sometimes. So let me start with the harbor presentation, which will take up immediately. So if there's no objection, I'm going to begin with that and let's turn our attention to our chief executive, Mr. John'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Slinger. Actually, let me say one thing, John, before you speak, Mr. Senator, it has to be at the study session as well. And so it may be that some of the questions or during the Q&A part, some of the staff might chime in if he's got to leave a little bit early.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we understand that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and city council members. Very good to be with you again. It's my third budget with you. And and it's as, as usual, an exhaustive effort just as the city budget process is this year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before we get started, I want to introduce a couple of the folks that may be answering questions later. Steve Rubin is our managing director of finance and administration. Steve led this entire process. It's an excellent job this year as usual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sad news is that Steve is retiring this year. So we're going to be missing Steve very, very much. Marina Lee is his number two. She's the director of finance. Will is here as well, along with Jason Brode. Jason is the manager of financial planning and analysis that put all all of the detail together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let me start by saying that our proposed budget is really a very conservative budget. It reflects the financial challenges and the uncertainty that our entire industry is facing at the moment. The budget calls for modest increases in revenue while keeping our operating expenses and our headcount at bay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A few of the highlights and I'm going to go into greater detail later in the presentation. But the budget totals $774 million, which includes about $500 million in planned capital investments, representing about two thirds of our total budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is not unusual. We also plan, as I said, for modest revenue growth. But that growth is subject to change given the conditions in the marketplace and the aggressive effort that our commercial teams are undertaking to bring business to the Port of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also have a $200 million in planned borrowing through bond issuance this coming fiscal year. And of course, we have our annual planned tidelands transfer, which we're estimating to be $17.8 million next year in fiscal 17. Now I mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Investing in our capital programs. It is really about being big ship ready as you as you remember earlier this year. We we christened the ship that's on this screen here called the Benjamin Franklin, an 18,000 TEU vessel, the largest that serves in the maritime industry today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To give you a sense of this, we expect more than 20 of this size of vessel to be to be deployed over the next 15 to 20 months into the Trans-Pacific Trade Line. Most of these will be coming to San Pedro Bay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we must be ready for these massive ships. And our investment strategy goes a long way towards achieving that end. We also are looking at often optimizing our terminal operations along with the entire supply chain. So we we have invested enormous amounts of time and effort to create the kinds of improvements in velocity and speed through our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'system that would be expected of a port of our caliber. And we'll continue to make those kinds of investments. One of the big capital projects is one you see going up every day. The Gerald Desmond Bridge replacement project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is going on schedule very, very well. It includes about $266 million in expenditures this coming fiscal year, which is more than half of our total budget. So it's a very big component and we're working very hard to complete that in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The westbound traffic will be flowing across the bridge and then by 2018 both lanes will be open and the old bridge will start to come down. So we're really moving smartly forward on this project. And it's a is a critical, critical and and really urgent project for the for the city and for the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another key project, as you are well aware, is our Middle Harbor project going along very, very well. We released phase one of a multi-phase project in April of this year, and the results of this operation have been really breathtaking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are they are progressing very rapidly against their goals. It is clearly the most advanced port technically in the world and the greenest. It's the world's first all electric cargo container handling facility. And it is one of a kind in the world.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And everybody is looking to this terminal as the as really the the model for the future of terminal development. We expect this entire project, all four phases of it, to be completed by 2020. So it's moving along smartly for completion, by and large this decade.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About 91, almost $100 million will be spent on this project in fiscal 17. We also have very, very critical plans to expand our on rail capabilities. And we're calling it America's Green Gateway, because it is we we are investing over the next few years more than $1,000,000,000 in expanding our rail operations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And why is this important? Well, first and foremost, it's the fastest pathway we have to going green or to reducing emissions. Just to give you a sense of it. One of these trains completed trains holds anywhere from the equivalent of 750 to 1000 truckloads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we eliminate 750 to 1000 trucks every time we build a full train and move it off of property. So it's very, very critical for us to expand that capability. We're currently at less than 30%. We expect to be over 50% with this America's Green Gateway Project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're and we're not stopping there. We expect to go beyond that if if at all possible, and moving as much truck traffic off the roads locally as possible. As you know, we're known as the Green Fort, and it's well-deserved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are totally focused on environmental sustainability. Everything we do starts with the view that what can we do to improve our environment? And we've been very, very aggressively pushing this for some time for over 11 years now. And we've achieved remarkable things relative to emissions reductions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, the tough part is we've we've done the 80%. The real tough part is the next 20%. And that's what we're focused on with our cleaner action plan, version 3.0 that's going to be released in the next few months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we are absolutely developing a pathway to getting as close to zero emission as possible technically. And this is and we won't rest until we achieve this. We also announced earlier, and most of you are aware of this, a $46 million community mitigation grant program, which goes above and beyond the mitigation programs we have with our big'",
        "'speaker_3': 'projects like Middle Harbor, like the Bridge. All of those come with a mitigation budget, but we're going beyond that with about a $4 million a year plan over the next ten years to reach out to the community at large and fund important mitigation programs around the environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're very excited about the first such program in the world that we're aware of, and it's very consistent with our green strategy. Also to to focus on business continuity and and being a good neighbor. We continue to be the leader in C seaport, security and safety.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, this is a picture of our latest addition called The Protector. It's the world's most advanced firefighting vessel. It's remarkable. It's the biggest, fastest, most technically advanced. And it's one of two that we have built and one, one, one now delivered and the second soon to be delivered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are focused in 2017 on additional security projects and safety projects totaling almost $20 million in expenditures. Now when it gets down to the community level, we have really reached out and upped the ante here. You know, we partner with full hearts and tremendous, tremendous effort on the community in the city making Long Beach what it is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the best place to work and live. One way we do this is through our community sponsorship program, and that's where we work with local groups to help reach residents and provide information that's critical for their knowledge of what we do at the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This fiscal year, we received 273 sponsorship applications, the highest number in our history, and we awarded 161 of those sponsorships for a total of $745,000. In fiscal 2017, we increased that budget to $1,000,000 and our Board of Harbor Commissioners were adamant that this become a an ever strengthening program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the first round of calls for this fiscal year is starting September one. So it is now actively engaged. Now what I want to do is talk for a moment, a little bit more about the details of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a breakdown of our sources of fund. And as you can see, the first two lines are operating revenue and our non-operating revenue, which if you add those numbers out, they're basically slightly increasing revenue over what we actually achieved in fiscal 16 to what we're proposing in fiscal 17.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're also, as you can see, significantly increasing the amount of debt that we intend to bring online as as available for capital projects, as well as our fund project, our harbor fund balance. So we're that's which is reducing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So our total sources of funds for doing all that we do is going to increase by nearly $100 million that's represented in this chart, which shows you how this kind of breaks down. Operating revenue and non-operating revenue represents about two thirds of what we fund, and the rest comes from debt service, which is about 31% and some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'small amounts coming out of our treasury. Now on the expenditure side, our personal expenses are just slightly increasing to $62 million and our non-personal expenses are declining. So there's a net reduction by a small amount of our overall expenses related to operations at the port.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Tidelands transfer is is flat. The proposed amount will be 17.7 million. And the debt service, because of a tremendous paydown in our debt in the last year, reduces from $185 million down to $113 million. So a substantial improvement there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But where you see the big increase is in capital expenditures, you know, about $150 million in increased capital spend, which means jobs. And with our port wide play that we implemented earlier this year, that represents about 5500 new jobs through the life of that program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're very excited about it. And we're certainly primarily focused on the capital side, which is exactly what our core mission is. When you look at it from a from a graphic standpoint, you can see clearly that capital expenditures is our business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We build infrastructure. That's what we do. We serve the maritime industry by building the critical things, the critical infrastructure they need to do their jobs. So that's our primary mission and investing our revenue to increase the port's competitiveness and continually enhance our our commercial value proposition is what we're all about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. We have I have a few minutes. I can get over to the other meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And you, Mr. Schlanger, you know that I think that you're doing an excellent job, and we're very thankful for the work that you do, your leadership team and of course, the work that the commission does every single day, just to ensure that Long Beach continues to lead not just the nation but the country when it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'comes to a green port, being responsible, being good neighbors with the community and moving America's cargo. So thank you for all your work on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I, too, want to thank you and your team for the excellent work and the presentation, and especially Steve Rubin and his team for putting together the budget briefings for the council members. I always find those to be very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a couple of things that I just wanted to highlight in the budget that that really stood out for me. And I think they're of very broad interest to the residents of Long Beach, given that we are in fact a port town.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that obviously the partnership of the port with various community organizations and various community projects is huge. I think it's it's something that I agree with the harbor commissioner, something that that should continue because it shows our partnership in making the city better, making our community stronger and having reached the threshold of $1,000,000 in community sponsorships is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'something to really be proud of. And I want to thank you for investing in so many community programs that would not otherwise be able to get off the ground without the port support. So thank you for that. I also think, you know, you made a comment about getting big ship ready.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think it's important to note that $500 million has been allocated in the budget to capital infrastructure projects, and that's more than any port in the U.S. And I think that's definitely worth noting. We're not just talking the talk about getting ready for the changes in the industry, but we're actually investing in that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And sometimes that investment process can be very painful because 65% of the budget is allocated to capital in infrastructure projects. So that can be a painful process, but I think it's worthwhile for the future. I also want to highlight the the port's consistent support in making sure the mitigation projects that the port participates in are those that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'benefit the community and the precious resources that we have in the community. The Colorado Lagoon, for example, is one of those resources. It's in my district. It's a it's a major asset to to the city of Long Beach as one of the few remaining areas of wetland habitation in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the ports partnership in regards to the lagoon has made it possible for us to be able to restore it, and we continue to look forward to that partnership with the port. A couple of questions that I had regarding kind of where the industry is heading.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I know that in 2015 we had a relatively strong year and then 2016 it was kind of flat. What is what is the future look like? Can you can you tell I guess I should ask you what the price of oil is going to be in a few years, too, but to the best of your ability'",
        "'speaker_5': ', what can you tell us about the future?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it's really a you know, a multifaceted answer. But the core issue is that the global economy. Particularly the consumer demand for goods has softened dramatically over the last 18 months. Now, we had we have had good years in spite of that, because the US is the only bright spot in the global economy in terms of consumer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'demand. So in reality, we continue to grow. We're seeing quite healthy growth through the port complex, keeping pace with the entire industry for imports and exports into and out of the United States. But the the struggle has been that when the industry came out of the Great Recession, the ocean carriers went on a spending spree, planning for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tremendous growth going forward. All the forecasts were very robust. And so they started buying these massive ships and building, you know, spending billions and billions of dollars on on new new infrastructure in particularly these ships. And then suddenly, without real warning, the global economy led by Europe started melting down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then, of course, followed by that would be Asia, led by China. And so in the throes of all that. The prices for the containers or the goods that are shipped by by across the ocean drop through the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We literally two years ago during the height we were seeing and it wasn't the highest prices ever, but we saw very high prices around 2000 to 20 $500 per container to move it from Asia to the west coast of the United States.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That dropped to as low as $700 in just a few months. And at $700, you're losing tremendous amounts of money in the transport of those goods. And it stayed low and even got lower than that over the course of the last six months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's all about the problem of matching capacity to demand, which is an age old challenge for businesses. But this is on a mega scale, right? So you have these massive ships all coming online. They're all being delivered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, 54% of all the ships that are being delivered for the rest of the decade are so big that they won't fit through the Panama Canal. They're massive ships. They're all coming this way. And so what do you do with that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, you have to figure out how to match your capacity to the softened demand, and that's what's happening. So we're seeing an advantage to us. We're seeing a tremendous disadvantage in the industry because the markets aren't demanding the goods.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I guess, long story short, I think it's pretty bright for us. I think it's tough for the industry. But the last couple of days as things started to stabilize and even with the changing situation that's been in the news, that's beginning to show some positive signs of resolution, even though, you know, Hanjin has a long ways'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to go. The good news is prices have been climbing like mad and with increased prices for the goods being shipped, they that will transform the industry in a matter of months. And that's where I see the great opportunity for the industry is in the pricing side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope that gives you a sense of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It does. It's it's fascinating. And I'm sure you can educate us a lot more about it because it's it's an area that we don't really talk about as much as we should, because it really is a fascinating dynamic for us to have right here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hard to answer it in less than an hour.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand. Thank you very much. I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Seeing no other questions from the council. Let me just say, you know, John, to you and the whole team that's here. Thanks again for all the work that you do. And as a reminder to the community, one out of every eight jobs in the city of Long Beach, that's one out of every eight jobs, is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'somehow tied directly back to goods, movement, ports and trade that we do. So it's a huge it is the largest part of our local economy, the largest part of the local economy. And so we're very appreciative to the good stewardship over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you again. Thank you and appreciate it. Thank you. Let me also a couple of things I forgot to say also that the first item up right before a municipal band is going to be the commission appointments, then municipal band.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as we're going to get the commission appointments ready, let me also just do a quick announcement. We have just Romeo in the audience. I know for sure. Just stand up for a second. I want the council and the community theater to see you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You probably have heard that we have hired a new director of the Long Beach Airport. That's Mr. Jess Romo, who's standing there over here to my left. Mr. Romo is an accomplished aviation professional with 19 years of aviation experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He went through a very long search, national search through our entire team here at the city for this election. He was the interim deputy executive director for the L.A. World Airports, overseeing the operations and emergency management sector at the L.A. International Airport since July.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He was also director of airports and operations over at Ontario International and Van Nuys Airports. Mr. Romo holds a B.A. in psychology from U. C, UCI and M.A. in Industrial Psychology from Cal State, L.A. And he has all the appropriate airport accreditations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a lot here, so I won't read all of them, but becomes well qualified. We've heard nothing but great things about you from a variety of different folks in the in the aviation community. And so let's give Mr. Romo a big round of applause and welcome him to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as you've been probably been told, the airport is never a controversial issue in Long Beach. And so you have just great things to look forward to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we start.'"

        "'speaker_5': 'municipal band and getting the group the neighborhoods very excited about what the municipal band does and all the great positive benefit that they bring to our community. I'm incredibly proud to support this organization and are very, very proud of their fundraising efforts this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, they were able to raise a great deal of money in light of the fact that there was a different fundraising structure that started this year in terms of the support we had placed on them, the burden of raising $30,000 towards a sixth week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they met that fundraising goal. And although fundraising effort overall wasn't as good as we would have liked it to be, I think the fact that we had two different fundraising operations going on and definitely not always coordinated may have contributed to some of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm hoping that moving forward, we take advantage of the momentum that this group has started and work very closely with our Parks Rec and Marine Department to continue to grow this really this piece of Long Beach history that's so vital to so many, so many of our communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm not sure if Parks Rec and Marine has a report. Okay. So I think they do. But as they make their way up and the friends group makes their way up, I also want to thank them for including a new district as the six week this year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that was an incredible addition.

The funding from the concerts comes from three sources. Sponsorships, such as our Long Beach Gas and Oil Department, Environmental Services, Division of the Public Works Department and the Port of Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, friends of you of the municipal band. Also thanks the Long Beach Community Foundation for their support. By investing our funds with the Community Foundation, this partnership allowed us to promise our donors an efficient means to donate online and to receive prompt acknowledgment of their tax deductible donations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With the Community Foundation charging only one and one quarter percent in fees and paying interest annually on invested funds in their trust. This means that almost 100% of the funds donated support nothing but our municipal band.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm Bill Thomas. I'd also like to add my thanks to all the donors and note that we got a slow start because of some confusion at the beginning. But from February, middle February to just before the band began, we managed to raise our $30,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The majority of that was from new business donors that we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were able to bring in. And we were also successful in bringing in quite a few new family and individual donors that, according to the records that were available to us, had not made any donation for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Appreciate or thank the mayor for recommending support of additional 70,000 to include the sixth week and want to say that we appreciate everything that everybody has done from the city council to all the participants in.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Continuing this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Process so that we can continue to support the band. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Bill, I think that was a little sneaky there at 60,000, not 70.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would have sworn I heard seven.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we'd love to take a picture and invite Marcel.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'From the Community Foundation and our conductor, Larry Curtis, to come on down for a photo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also. Oh, good. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me let me just say to to to Larry and of course, to the friends and to everyone involved. We have a we have a few folks are going to say a few things here from the council, and there's a lot of interest in support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just wanted to let you all know that. And I think it's more for the community to know that Long Beach has a lot of arts groups. There's a lot of museums, a lot of organizations. But there are only two municipally funded organizations separate of the Arts Council that are actually performing groups that are actually performing or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have some kind of art. It's the Beach Museum of Art, which is our municipal museum, and then it's the municipal band, which is our city band. Those are the two city arts organizations that are that are performing or doing shows within the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so a lot of you don't know that that the city has to. And of course, we also have the Arts Council, which is a little bit different of a role, but it's a big deal. The museum has been around for over 100 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys provide incredible music and fun for a lot of people, and we're really proud to support all the work you guys do every year. So thank you to Larry and the team and the friends. Fantastic work. And so and I want to thank Councilman Price and the coauthors for bringing this forward as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price, did you have anything else, sir?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me turn to the second of the motion, which was Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Many of you saw me out at Municipal Band this summer. It's a great asset in our community. I think that the structure of the program and their ability to bring costs down over the years has been significant in the city's ability to maintain the funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's definitely hard. When the city went through the downturn, the economy and to still have been able to fund arts is a remarkable thing for our city. And I think that their component of the 100 days of summer really are a city wide asset that we're able to advertise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that in our side of town for the first time, the council office worked hard to ensure that community members knew about 100 days of summer, and specifically the municipal band concerts. We used over $3,000 of district funds to send out a mailer to our residents to let them know about the municipal band and their playing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in the community. Because when I knocked on doors throughout the district, many people didn't know about the amazing asset of concerts every Friday in Eldorado Park. And so this year I felt as though the community had grown, and I think that more were engaged in knowing of the opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's a big part of the ability for the friends of the municipal band to continue to be successful. I want to thank the police department who stepped up the presence this summer at our concerts in the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The larger our crowds go grow, the more important it is that we really protect public safety. I want to thank Marie for your diligent work with relation to growing a partnership directly with the Friends of the Municipal Band.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know that there's been changes through the years in that fundraising structure and whether it was through partners of Parks or the other organizations, I think that donors, knowing that 99.7 or 94, 98.75% of every donation goes directly to fund the municipal band is a big step in the right direction with all the accountability that we look'",
        "'speaker_1': 'at in our nonprofits these days and making sure admit as well. That being said, I appreciate that the friends are already working with Parks and Rec and looking at how to fill that $27,000 shortfall. I think it's important that we continue to work towards figuring out a long term strategy of filling that every year, because it's important'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that as we grow other types of concerts to fill in the gap, whether it's the community band or symphonic winds or other groups that come to us as a council and ask for funding, that we also realize that a lot of their ability to play in the parks is based on the generation of activity and support that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'starts with the launch of the municipal band there where where the crowds start. And then they continue that tradition throughout the summer, no matter who picks up those additional weeks. So thank you for what you do and thank you for the other arts programs that really get to take advantage of the work in publicity and marketing and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'partnership that you do. I know that my neighbor is 94 years old and she used to be a bucket collector for the municipal band and she still talks about that. And it's a good sense of pride for her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And she did it every single concert for years. And so I hope that we can get that structure back in place. She knew the people. She knew who to go to. She made sure that at the end of the summer they had a little receipt that said that they donated for their their tax I.D. purposes, even though'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they gave cash. And so I appreciate the work that's been done to really further that effort. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to thank the municipal band for being at Drake Park. I think that was such a although we were here at council, I remember a lot of our residents had just really been very thrilled to have the municipal band there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it was just a different mood and it was just a. Beautiful night from what all the pictures showed me and from all of their emails and just contact with us. So thank you very much for all your work and we look forward to many wonderful events coming up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Everingham.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. I do want to express my congratulations to them, this woman, for another wonderful season. I share Lost Eurydice Park with District eight, my colleague. And it was always a wonderful time to to see you on Wednesday nights playing at the concerts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But most importantly, it was a great night out for me and my wife to enjoy your music. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Superman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I just have a question for staff, and it's kind of a follow up to what my colleague from the first District said. We have two concerts a year in Whaley Park. We're not getting any additional. And they are on Tuesday night.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one is a council meeting night and the other is our dark night. But that's when I hold my community meeting. It wasn't a problem this past year because my residents preferred going to the concert than my community meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I would just like to ask staff if we can have an adjusted adjustment to that moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I want to thank the friends. I want to thank Marcel and the the foundation for your your assistance in making this tradition ongoing. Obviously, in the Los Cerritos Park, we enjoy the municipal band. It signifies the fact that we are the summer season has has is upon us when when whenever two minute municipal band'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is playing on Wednesday nights, it draws several hundred or even probably a couple thousand people every every Wednesday night. And the community has in kind of supported that with additional concerts with the live bands. There's nothing that can replace our municipal band and the great professionalism and the sweet sounds that come from that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But also, I think more importantly, as my my colleague Ms.. Mongeau mentioned, when you knock on doors, people are connected to you that if they live in a in a community that actually is fortunate enough to have the municipal band in, and I know there are other areas of the city that don't have that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I would like to see that happen so that everybody actually feels that that essence of Long Beach. And so, you know, there's a there's a song This is Summertime in the LBC, the middle. Also, the municipal band signifies summertime in LBC in a big way.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so thank you for all you doing. We'll continue to support you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Mongo to follow up to Councilmember Supernovas question. Marie, would you know what the collections are like from night to night? What our strongest nights are for the bucket collection and what hour are more weeknights are end? And does that correlate with crowd size?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, is it that so many people are watching council meetings on Tuesdays that they just can't make it to the municipal event?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, as you said earlier, I'm all about the data. And the data would suggest that more people are watching your meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On Tuesday nights. I'm just kidding. Actually, traditionally, our Tuesday night attendance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As well as our obviously then bucket collections are the lowest evening. Tuesday nights are about or the Wednesday Thursday concerts are running about three times the attendance as our Tuesday nights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would there be a possibility if we are able to fund the six week through the Budget Oversight Committee as a recommendation to this full body? Instead of six weeks that four nights a week, which would be 24 concerts, we would be able to do three nights a week at eight, eight weeks that we would be able to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go to a full eight weeks of a summer again. Is that a possibility that could be explored?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's certainly something we can explore. We can talk with the band to see how logistically that would work and we would have to work out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Somewhat of a schedule to bring back then to the council. Because when you take the Tuesday nights away, do we, Adam, at the end.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of the first six weeks at those locations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we would come back with some options. So coming from the regiment of a high school where music is expensive and those kinds of things, one of the things we'd have to consider are of course working in so that the Drake Park, the Whaley Park, the Bluff Park would actually get a Friday night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there wouldn't be any additional music costs. It would just be really a shift so that the whole city would have the access and opportunity and then hopefully that would be able to fill the gap of that $27,000 shortfall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If there was significantly higher attendance, maybe that would be an option. But of course, again, this body can only think of things. And again, our two council members weren't able to attend those. But I hope that we can find a way where structurally the donations and the attendance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that the number one priority is that more people get to experience the municipal band. And so in no way would I ever expect all eight weeks of Friday nights to be in Eldorado Park. I don't I think that'll be very selfish, but that we would hope that the other side of town I know David mentioned'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to me sixth district still doesn't have a concert. What does that look like? And I think that that would be helpful. I know a week is a short turnaround, but we are going to talk about Parks and Rec at Budget Oversight next week and would love some input because I think that at least from the colleagues, the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'comments I've heard from my colleagues were very supportive of the mayor's recommendation to ensure that an additional 60,000 is put in that direction. Or, as Bill said, maybe we'll make a mistake and do 70,000. We'll see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We will come back with something for next week.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. And I would just say I agree wholeheartedly with those points. Looking forward to seeing ways that we can, you know, make sure that everyone can experience our official city municipal band. Councilman Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mrs. Mongo, for speaking up on me. But maybe that 10,000 that we made a mistake on, we could probably use that, and we could get one in 63. So we're going to get it. It's coming. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I need 19. You got nine to put up. We'll discuss next week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm pretty sure we do. Okay. Take all my one time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Spending money for a concert in the park. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take public comment on this item. Do we already have that? Let's take public comment on this item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi Karen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Reside. I'm speaking tonight as a resident of this city and someone who went to my first municipal band concert when they played on Sundays and Bixby Park, Bandshell when I was a child, my grandmother lived on first and Gaby Ohta.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My family was a musical family. My dad, my uncles and my grandfather were in a municipal band in Chicago. I have great love for the municipal band. I've also volunteered at most of the concerts and a couple of things that haven't been mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is the oldest operating continuously band in the United States, and I know it's been under threat a number of times, and it warms my heart to see the support tonight for this institution within our city. That really is the cultural piece and the 107 years that they've been in operation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've always service the community as a child. There was music everywhere and I just love going. It helped develop my love of music. The other thing that's really a benefit from the concerts that I've seen by attending so many is the community feeling that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It creates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all the people that end up talking to each other and the connections that have been made. You just can't know how much that impacts our community. So thank you all for supporting the municipal band.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. John Dietz. Good evening. Vice Mayor and council members want to thank you for the additional concerts that we got this year, the welcome addition. But above me on that, I want to thank the friendly municipal band Bill Thomas, whose acquaintance I only made a couple of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But most importantly, Laura Espino, who has been at the concerts at Los Rios Park for just about as long as I can remember. She has really done yeoman's work in doing a lot of coordination there and fundraising, and I took direction for her this year with where I directed my personal donations because she did not want to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'see the partners of Parks collections diminished. In favor of the friends of the missile band, so I want the writing to check. The bigger one went to Partners of Parks, which made sense to me, but Laura said it was the right thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I don't think anybody in this room can thank Laura enough for what she's done for all those years. Thank you, Laura. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Carolyn Burns. I'd like to thank my fellow citizens, Kay Caufield and Bill Thomas and his wife Shirley, for being such adamant supporters of the municipal ban. I think music is really important, and I echo the words of a woman who just spoke with regards to the sense of community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are so many bad things happening around us and around the entire United States with neighbors and violence. But I think this is an incredibly positive thing that we need to strongly foster and grow. The mention earlier of when going door to door knocking that people aren't aware of the municipal band and its activities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that this is an opportunity to grow that awareness and I know that one of the most potent tools in my neighborhood and I know the city utilizes it is next door. And this is a wonderful organ from which to project information about activities in the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would strongly encourage the city to allow access for the people from the municipal band to announce their performances in advance and to make a written statement in their announcement that there is a contribution that is optional such that this contribution level can increase to continue to support the band.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for all of your support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Final speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good. One of the ideas I've always toyed around with and that what might help the financial situation but also bring the band to more people. And these next two or three years are going to be an excellent opportunity to try.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is put the band on a barge in the Marine Stadium, which we could pack on both sides with spectators. Now, because of the work that's being done around our waterfronts in various parts, we will have a number of those barges that I think we can negotiate with the owners to for the day of the park, day'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the band, put that puppy, put the band on that puppy. And it can slowly move up and down the northern half of the stadium with people on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So let's go ahead and say no more no further public comment. Let's go ahead and ballot. And I mean. Yes. It's the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Let's go ahead and take our public comment for the night. I have eight speakers here speak. Steve Updike. Diana Liggins. John Dietz. Larry Goodhue.

I'm here tonight to speak in favor of a comprehensive minimum wage increase and strong wage enforcement. I'm going to focus my comments on one aspect of the minimum wage discussion tonight outreach and education around wage enforcement'",

Funds allocated for wage enforcement education need to be dedicated to culturally appropriate outreach for workers building healthy communities.'",

There are many such organizations in the Building Healthy Communities Network, such as the Filipino Migrant Center and the Long Beach Immigrant Rights Coalition.'",

It's not enough to add more jobs. We must ensure that we are promoting living wages.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that is should be looked after as a city. But to represent the businesses. Being a small owner, small business owner, it is not easy. It is difficult being a small owner business. But I think it is better to be with the state.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Coming from parents that came from Central America, from El Salvador, going through school is something that entry level jobs, it it's just an entry level job. If you want to look for careers, look for careers. But if we put ourselves in a position as a Long Beach to make businesses or allow businesses not to be attractive, we're'",
        "'speaker_11': 'not going to be in a good situation. Short words. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. You can turn this over to Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank everyone for coming out today. I know that over the last several months we have held not most recently, but before that held many public comment meetings where the community came out. And I think that it's important to have our voices heard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that the voices of Long Beach were heard not just in Long Beach, but more importantly in Sacramento. And I really feel passionately that Long Beach ended up being a leader at the state level. And many businesses who came to our meetings felt strongly that making sure that we were on an even even playing field'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with our neighboring cities was important. So with that, I'd like to make the motion to follow SB three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just for clarification. Also, SB three for those that are in the audience essentially is the state mandated weight schedule. Okay. That's just for. Just just to clarify for that, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I, too, want to thank everybody for being here and speaking today. I had the last course of many months researching all of the ideas, listening to everybody's feedback, having meetings with labor and business and everybody in between to ensure that we got this right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I have a few things that I'd like to add. I, too, would like to also follow SB three and make sure that we align with the state. I think that's the most appropriate thing to do at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition, I'd like to offer a friendly amendment that would include a strong to ensure that we're developing a strong, weak wage enforcement program. So there's a few things that we've done already when we were looking at the economic impacts of a minimum wage, minimum wage ordinance, when we were looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so it did include $475,000, so $475,000. First, I'd like to ensure that we dedicate to supporting to the support and outreach, working with local community groups to ensure that the public is truly informed about wage theft. Two I'd like to, in addition to the $475,000, I'd like to add to wage enforcement investigators to ensure that we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'are have something on the city side to complement that outreach and support. And three, we do have a local Department of Industrial Relations office that Jack had mentioned to me about last last week. And so I think that it's important that we have a Department of industrial relations here locally, because we may be able to leverage funds'",
        "'speaker_5': ', the funds that we're putting together, the $475,000 funds that they might have to be able to work with them. But that's just in addition to what we're going to do here as a city. So, again, $475,000 dedicated to wage enforcement investigators on top of that funding, and then also finding additional avenues, additional ways to enforce wage theft'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So that is my friendly amendment. I hope you'll accept I will also support your your motion to ensure that we're aligning with the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Will you accept? I will take those under consideration. And I'd like to hear from my colleagues. Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Orson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. This has been a long road. And I want to, first of all, thank the many advocates who have spent many, many nights with us. Many public comments and many public hearings on this issue over the past year and a half.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to just say that I've been inspired by many of the young people, the advocates who have really worked hard to change the landscape for workers in L.A. County, the city of L.A., and here in Long Beach, and ultimately statewide.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You have really made a difference in our state, and millions of workers in the state are going to benefit from your actions and your activism. And so you should be saluted for that. It hasn't been an easy conversation because people feel strongly on both sides of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But this city did take an affirmative stand several months ago to help force legislation in Sacramento, and I think we were all successful in doing so. We now have a statewide minimum wage and I will be in support of that part of the motion also.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just want to just say that I think it's very, very important that that we find balance in policy. And I got to tell you, making policy is not easy. It's not an easy effort, particularly when you have people on both sides of an issue that make them feel so strongly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Many of our small business owners are not wealthy people. They are their middle class folks who live in our neighborhoods who are struggling to make ends meet. Just like everybody else today, we have an opportunity to, I think, do something significant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm going to support I thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez, for for bringing forward the wage enforcement component, because I think that's important. You know, I think it's important because it's been very it's been articulated very, very clearly that we have some challenges in our city that we need to address and perhaps we can assist the state.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was on the state of California's website the other day, and I noticed they're actually hiring people with the Department of Labor Standards in enforcement right here in Long Beach, which is, I think, good news in a positive direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so perhaps we will see some assistance along the way. I like the idea of doing community outreach and education and you know, and in going into community contracts, obviously, there are people on the ground who have been working for several months who have identified the need and know where the say the bones are buried, so to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'speak. And so with that, we will be able to, I think, assist with with education, which I think is most important in wage enforcement. Oftentimes, workers don't know what their rights are, even though every employer is supposed to post with the minimum wages, every employer is supposed to have OSHA standards and things of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oftentimes, people are just going to work to make, make, make ends meet, and they don't pay attention to that piece. And so to have some enforcement and some some oversight, I think is is very, very important. I've also heard over the past several weeks about concerns over this training wage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I've heard you loud and clear. I was the person that originally brought that forward. And so I'd like to make it a friendly amendment because, you know, at the end of the day, the minimum wage is the minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And you've heard me say that over and over again. My position has been consistent. Six months ago, a year ago, I told you I support a statewide minimum wage. And we were we achieved that. And so with that, I'd like to add a friendly amendment to remove the training wage component of this this ordinance, if that would'",
        "'speaker_10': 'be acceptable. Because I think the speakers have made it very clear. I mean, when I was 16 years old, I made the minimum wage and it wasn't any different then than the wage for for four for anyone else.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so that's a component that I'd like to remove from this this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will be assured that there are no variances and no training wage, and my motion. Is that clear? Mr. Bass.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I understand it, we would be following the state S.B. three all the way, which does have a a provision that allows for 160 hours of pay at 85%, as opposed to what was proposed earlier in the city's ordinance, which was 480 hours at 85%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the state the state would if we follow the state, as was suggested, someone would be able to employ a new entrant into the job market for that 120 hour period at 85%.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you for that clarification and I'd be fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I just think, you know, the role of local government is in particularly in this on this particular issue is is is is being challenged, is changing. And I appreciate the fact that that so many people have feel so strongly about this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Generally, the wage enforcement component is something that would be done by the state and has traditionally been done by the state. But I think the workers here have made their point, and I think that there is a will from the council to to move in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'll support that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I also want to thank you. I know that the wage dialog throughout the weeks has been complicated, and I feel that you've been very thoughtful and really looking to examples across the state, and I appreciate you being a leader on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And of course, I would take that recommendation. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Pearce. I'm sorry. It's Pierce. Councilwoman Pierce is next after Councilman Price and Mary Richardson. So I'm looking at the wrong thing here. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No problem. So I have a few questions for. So, first of all, I support the motion to. Adopt the state's minimum wage policy. I definitely think one of the biggest issues that was raised through the discussion with our business community in advance of the vote last time was making sure that our business community is on a level'",
        "'speaker_5': 'playing field with nearby cities. And I think that's hugely important. And as some of the people in this room know, I'm grateful that I'm able to be part of this discussion, because the last time this issue came to a vote, I actually received a phone call in the middle of public comment from Chief Terry because my kids'",
        "'speaker_5': 'had called 911. My husband had been taken to the hospital. So I had a very legitimate reason for not being here. And I was texting my colleagues from the E.R. and I'm grateful for the council colleagues who voted last week to allow me to be part of this conversation, because it's very important to my district and to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the city as a whole. So thank you for allowing me to do that. The few questions that I have really have to do with the ways wage enforcement piece, and there's a few things I want to talk about and then I want to hear what my my colleagues have to say regarding some of the concerns that I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have. So I'm going to go through a little bit of data on some research that I, I did along with my staff in preparation for tonight's meeting. But just preliminarily, before we get into the slides. Mr. Mayes, can the city actually enforce a state ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the state ordinance specifically gives this city to have the authority to do that, it can. And we will go back and review SB three thoroughly to see if there is that authority to do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So sitting here today, we don't even know if the city has the authority to enforce a state ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This particular state ordinance? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we would be voting on something that we don't even know that we have the authority to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, basically, as I understand what you would be voting on if the motion stays as it currently is with the two friendly amendments that were accepted, we would see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Only the second friendly line as it's still pending.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry, sir. With the second friendly amendment that was made, there wouldn't necessarily be a need to bring back a city ordinance. We would simply follow the state regulations, but add the component, which would basically be budget adjustments to hire additional city staff who would assist in community outreach and waive wage theft investigation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And I shared with a few of my colleagues that I have some data that I wanted to share with this group tonight. And so I put it into a PowerPoint just a little bit ago just to make it so that we all kind of follow along on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But my question is this the friendly that's proposed asked for $475,000 in addition to two investigators. How much would those investigators cost?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman Price. We are estimating that with salary benefits and some materials and supplies and in some vehicles that it would be about $220,000 for for two positions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're talking about about $700,000 total.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct, for the first year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then how much would and this I'm assuming if we're going to set up a wage enforcement department in the city, it's some if if the amendment was approved. What's the problem?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there's a misunderstanding. There was no department set up in the friendly. Unless I misheard the price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, okay. Let me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me. Let me rephrase. If we set aside $475,000 for wage enforcement and added to investigators, I'm assuming that the employees who want to see wage enforcement in the city of Long Beach would want that to be an ongoing thing, not a one time thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that an assumption that we're making?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we know? I have. We. Have we? Is this going to be a one time fund or is this something that we hope to do on an ongoing basis?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Councilwoman Pryce, my understanding for the original city manager's proposal, we did use one time funds for the for 75. And we will work to to look at how much it actually cost to run a program on an ongoing basis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That could be less than that amount, or it could be more depending on the actual case loads.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what I'm saying is we wouldn't be able to use one time funds for an ongoing program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We would at some point when we have an ongoing program, would want to build it into the budget structurally per our financial policies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So in regards to this 700,000 or so, more than 700,000, what enforcement mechanisms do we expect the investigators to be able to do? Have we thought about what they would be able to do that doesn't already exist through the state?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilwoman Price, we we were planning to enforce the local minimum wage now that we have an ordinance now that we're following the state's ordinance. We would be looking at following all types of minimum wage and wage theft items.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that would include we would like more direction, you know, exactly on that. But that would include overtime issues and wage lost wage items issues. Okay. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can the city adjudicate a wage theft claim that's made in the city? But that's against a state ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman Pryce, as I indicated, will be reviewing SB three thoroughly to see if they did delegate any authority to local municipalities to do that. If if they didn't specifically do that, the answer would be no. So it would be more if the motion passed, as it's currently phrased, it would be more gathering information, taking complaints, perhaps working'",
        "'speaker_7': 'together with the local state agencies to provide them information about our investigations, those those sorts of things. And we'd outreach, obviously, to the local DA to see what assistance we could be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So the friendly that I would like to make and I'd like Councilmember Mongo to consider it is setting aside the money, but allowing our city to work with the Department of Labor to I'm sorry, the Department of Industrial Relations to determine how exactly the city could work with the state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First of all, we need to review the state ordinance to make sure that the city has the power to get involved in its own enforcement, to assuming that we do. I'd like us to work with them to find out how exactly we could augment their services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because based on my conversation with them and I spoke with the Labor Commissioner's office, they are under the umbrella of the State Department of Finance. They're currently funding numerous new positions for this coming fiscal year in order to deal with wage enforcement and wage theft specifically.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one of the areas where there's been a lot of progress statewide is the mere idea of calling it wage theft like that. Calling it what it is alone has resulted in the claims being treated differently. And that's really only happened with Governor Brown's administration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one of the things that we had a very long conversation that we've been talking for a while with my staff and today I personally spoke with them. I'm calling it what it is has resulted in a very different focus from the statewide level to the issue of wage enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they are funding a whole new crop of positions for this fiscal year, including positions in the Long Beach office. The majority of the new positions are going to go into the retaliation team because that's an area where they found people are hesitant to file wage theft claims because of retaliation issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Their field office in Long Beach is very active and will be receiving both field investigators and folks to work in retaliation statewide. They actually received in this past year 32,000 claims that they forwarded to their adjudication office. It's my understanding that even with our own wage enforcement arm, the city of Long Beach could not assist in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'adjudication of claims. We could not we would need to work with the state in order to be able to adjudicate claims. So we would be we would not be able to advance or move along or are fast track any of these claims because we would still be on a state timeline for adjudication.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The field office last year in Long Beach received 2500 claims. That's how many claims were filed in that office. The claims were handled. The L.A. Office received 3100 claims. The claims are handled anywhere from a few days to up to a year if the process is actually going to go to an adjudication hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But every claim that was filed was resolved in some capacity. Only a third of the claims actually went to adjudication. So two thirds of the claims were actually processed by the state's wage theft enforcement team. To me, that sounds very effective.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What they said is they work routinely with community groups in order to enhance their outreach efforts. They have a budget already for outreach and marketing. They have a field investigator team for field enforcement team. They have retaliation services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a very robust team that, again, they're adding to. They have an adjudication legal team. What the labor commissioner told me today is that if the city were going to adopt something like this, we would absolutely need because we'd want to do it right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We wouldn't just want to say we did it so that we can, you know, get a headline or to get a win. We would want to do it right, because that's what the workers deserve. The workers deserve a team that is actually committed and has the subject matter expertize we would need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In-house labor attorneys like the State Department of Industrial Relations has they have a whole team of attorneys there. We would not be able to afford that with the $700,000 that we're planning to put into outreach. They also do outreach and marketing that's pretty robust.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have news radio ads. They advertise on Spanish radio as well as Spanish TV. They have bus ads. I shared this with one of my colleagues today, and we both agreed that this was a really great thing that we didn't know about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I told her I was going to mention it tonight. They have fliers that they pass out. They have TV ads that they do on Spanish TV as well as regular TV. And they also have a video on the process that they show.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have a video that they show people on what the process is, how you can apply for a wage theft claim. When you go in to make a wage theft claim, they talk about what the process is to make sure that your wage theft claim is adjudicated, who you can contact through the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are all things that they offer and they do offer at the Long Beach office. They also have a public works team that specially enforces prevailing wage claims. So they work directly with prevailing wage claims. They were very, very open to coming to the city of Long Beach, coming to council for a study session.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we were interested and talking to us about if we wanted to augment our enforcement somehow, how we could do that so that it best aligns with the state. They also talked about and some of the other states that we researched have done consequences for wage theft violators.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So wage theft claims can serve as a basis for rescinding or refusing to enter into a contract with violators. Wage theft claims can be the basis for denial of a permit or a license, and the requirement that a business post a notice when they are the subject of a wage theft investigation are all different methodologies that other'",
        "'speaker_5': 'states have used and other states have utilized very effectively to address wage theft issues. So these are all options that I would like us to consider and so that we can formulate if we want to do wage enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we feel like there's something that we can do to augment what the state is already doing, then I think we should move forward with a plan. So right now we're allocating, we're proposing and I know the friendly hasn't been accepted, but over $700,000 to something that one we don't know if we can enforce yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And two, we don't know how we would go about enforcing it. My recommendation would be I'm not opposed to having some sort of an enforcement arm in the in the city of Long Beach. I actually think it's a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just don't want to duplicate what the state is already doing. And I also don't want to take money that we could be using for other things if we're talking about a structural budget. We could be talking about additional police officers, which is what we need more than anything right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would rather say let's take a look at what the state is already doing and how they think we might be able to augment their services to really neat meet the needs of our city. And if we're able to do that, then I think we might be able to come in with a number that's less than'",
        "'speaker_5': '$700,000, which really would be a service to our constituents. So that's just a friendly that I want to propose and, you know, put out there. And I would love to hear from the rest of my colleagues. I'm open on this, but that's just given the data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't want us to be paying to duplicate something that's already being done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman, are you going to keep going on the speaker's list or are we back to you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to take that under advisement along with Lena's motion at the same time, I'll keep those in the list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And thank you. Maker of the motion councilmember mongo and Seconder Gonzalez. And I love the tenor from the entire council about compromise and having, you know, been a part of this debate for more than a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hearing hours of testimony from the community, from business, from workers. I am proud that Long Beach did lead and encouraged the state to go ahead and take action. And we did it what we considered the Long Beach way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We said when we passed this, it was the Long Beach way. But when we passed the Long Beach way, we didn't necessarily know that the state was going to go ahead and pass as well. And that sort of, in my opinion, before the idea was you get to 2019 and you hear, you know, you do a study'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and see what those impacts are and then you make decisions based on that. And the floor at that point was nine or $10. But that's changed. The floor has changed. We know that the fight for 15 is one on the state level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People are going to get the $15. The question now is when do they get to $15? And the question now is, what do we consider the Long Beach way? Well, the process that we've gone through over the course of the last few last year has highlighted a number of issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Workers have come forward and said very clearly that Long Beach need someone said it's night. Long Beach needs to stand out and not stand aside and protect workers and make sure that workers can can have their forces, their wages enforced.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've heard from businesses that they want a stable environment to run their business. We've heard that tonight. I think I'm here to speak in the spirit of compromise here. Gandhi said all compromise is based on give and take, but there can be no give and take on fundamentals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Any compromise on mere fundamentals is a surrender, for it is all give and no take. So what are the fundamentals for me? I believe that in order to find a middle ground, we have to make sure that everybody who came here understand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have to value, you know, the opinions of everybody here. And if anybody leaves without necessarily getting their way, I understand. But you need to value their their point of view and the perspective. And I've heard a bunch of testimony tonight specifically about wage theft and balancing out the interests of business with aligning so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, that said, if we're going to lead, I need my support. Tonight, I want to be able to support and be in consensus. But it is contingent it is entirely contingent on the acceptance of the very first friendly made by Councilmember Gonzalez, because there's no path for me to support this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would encourage the whole council to say no if there isn't a balanced a balanced approach here that talks about not just meeting the needs of business, we support that, but we need to acknowledge the fact that people have come here time after time and highlighted that the state is not cutting it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So without that, I can't move forward. So I'm going to ask, what is the motion on the floor right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Let me repeat that. The motion on the floor. There's a motion on the floor in two friendlies that neither of which have been accepted yet by the maker of the motion, which is Councilman Bongo. Currently, the motion on the floor is to, one, align the wage schedule to follow the Senate bill, a state program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the motion on the floor then. Then there's two friendlies, one which was made by Councilwoman Gonzalez, which included a a strong wage enforcement and kind of wage theft investigation policy with the addition of investigators to the already budgeted amount.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there was also a friendly by Councilman Price, which was to add, if I get it wrong, Councilman Price it just to do more research and to how we could work close closer with the state and other agencies to find ways of doing wage theft in that direction and not necessarily allocating the amount of money that was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'put forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, actually, what's that? We come we do we meet with the Department of Industrial Relations and come up with a better estimate of how much we think it's going to cost the state to not duplicate their efforts and have an effective enforcement team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because right now there's nothing our investigators could do to adjudicate the process faster than it's already being adjudicated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So so back to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you. So. Well, first point of order, can we even have a debate on friendlies that haven't been accepted?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would be better if the friendlies were accepted and debated. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So I would love to support. I know how much work Councilmember Mongeau has done on this. I know how much work Councilmember Gonzalez has done on this. But. If I don't hear an acceptance, then while I have the floor, I have no choice but to offer a substitute.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would like to hear which of those are you going to. I don't want to debate or speak to something that's not on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I respect that. And I would appreciate if before you make a substitute, I have the opportunity to hear from Pierce and your anger. It's only fair that I know that the order of which people queue up has some advantages, but I think that they've also been major players in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just want to hear their perspective before knowing where I stand.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so and I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll be ready for your substitute in case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So here's what I'll say. And I. And this is out of order. I prefer not to do it this way, but this is the option that the Council is putting in front of me. The on the first substitute, I agree on the set.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, on the first friendly. I agree on the second friendly. I agree there are certain certain questions that need to be answered. But this debate has linger for too long and frankly, we can move forward with the city staff has already put forth a plan and really it's a question on whether we legally can enforce it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or and then what can we integrate from the state level. And that's not something I feel like needs to be debate. That level of detail needs to be debated at council. I think we can move forward tonight with staff's plan and if anything needs to be adjusted based on anything we learn, then there are ways to do'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that. And we do that all the time. We learn something that happens, you know, through the state and but, you know, through the state. And we need to make adjustments. But tonight, we need to set aside if we're going to if we're going align with the state, we need to set aside the funding tonight to make sure'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we are we are one of the best in Fort. We've done it the Long Beach Way, which is now going to be defined as, you know, a city that takes its workers seriously. And we don't wait on the state to make sure everyone's paid a fair wage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that that would be what I have to say. And I look forward to seeing what the final motion is. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo. And then we're going to go into Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's chair of Budget Oversight. I will state that over the last several weeks I've had more meetings than I can possibly count, both by phone and in person with the budget officer of our city. Erickson I think she has done a phenomenal job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that within the 475. There's a lot of components that are not. Restricted. I think that what Vice Mayor Richardson is saying is really a testament to how the city staff had worked with putting together their budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then additionally, the mayor's recommendation. So I definitely see your perspective and I appreciate that you're going to wait to hear from our other colleagues before making a substitute, because I appreciate that you're allowing me to maintain the floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And. Thank you, everybody, that's done so much work leading up to this point, to the small businesses that got activated and got engaged. I think you guys took a lesson out of the organizing handbook. Job well done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I really applaud you guys for that work. It would be a surprise to anybody if I said I wasn't in support of increasing the minimum wage. I have sat in too many living rooms talking to workers. Many of them, yes, they deserve a wage increase.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And yes, the state has done that. But many of them have said shown me paychecks where they're not making what they're worth and what they have been committed to make. And so the conversation around wage theft is a real win for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Long Beach and one that I know from watching procedures. I know from having workers go through the process that, yes, there is things that the state and the county can do, but nobody can ensure that workers in our city are making sure that they're getting the wages they deserve, that they're getting their meal breaks that they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'deserve, their 15 minute breaks and all those things that wage self includes like those in Long Beach. And so my my very first question is to be clear that this would say that we are following the state level, we're following the state level on wage timeline, but that there would be a wage enforcement ordinance around wage theft'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Is that what you're proposing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council Member So I think that in my discussions with Mr. Mays and with Councilmember Gonzalez that we are not clear yet. There are instances in the state of California like a sworn law enforcement officer such as myself, that we can't enforce state laws and ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Today I met with someone from the federal level of the federal executive board, and there are things that a city is able to do. And so before we bring anything like that back, I would say that that would maybe perhaps be something that Councilwoman Gonzalez, this committee could look into and discuss before we get ahead of ourselves'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I think that leading and making the Long Beach way a part of the discussion and figuring out what the right fit is, I think also needs some process and some voice. And so I would like to empower Councilmember Gonzalez when we know what that looks like to meet with city staff, to meet with the community and figure'",
        "'speaker_1': 'out. And that committee would potentially long term, if we felt it necessary, which it might not be, bring something to the council if we find it necessary. Is that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I just wanted to be very clear that it's not just about staffing, not one person, but that we're saying we support going on the state timeline, but recognizing and empowering us as a city to enforce locally because we have local small businesses, we've got big business here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But while the state, they just don't have the resources, they're understaffed even with looking at new staffing that that's very clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll say again and I can't say the year for certain because it's been so long, but. When I worked at a factory, I took a claim to the Labor Board and so in discussions with my colleagues, including you, we kind of talked about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I went through the process, but one of the reasons that I was able to help several other workers at my office is because of outreach efforts and those other components that are built into the 475. And so again, it takes it takes dialog to get there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And oftentimes those those crucial moments in your life, you don't remember all the components that that really weighed in. So I appreciate your in my dialog on those matters. And I think that those are the components that are really going to make a difference for the Long Beach Way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. And so thank you for that very much. Councilmember Mongeau going on that. I think the other important part that's that's really important is the cultural competency and making sure that we have people that live in neighborhoods going meeting with workers that they have community with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that, again, is another reason why I would support Councilmember Gonzalez's motion to have two compliance officers. I'll go so far to say, and I don't want to complicate things too much, but even those two compliance officers, while they will be helpful, I still in my heart feel like that's not enough.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I say that today by saying that supporting this motion with the friendly amendment is still so much less than I think that our workers deserve and want to make sure that we are just moving forward with the proposal on the table.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But recognizing that. As much as we can advocate to have more funds, go to those community groups that are able to outreach to workers. The more worker outreach we have, the more turnaround we'll have and the more funds will come back to the city based on how many bad actors there are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I. I'm not going to make a friendly I'm not going to make a emotion for the sake of making sure that we move on today, but that I would fully expect for us to make a a full office of enforcement down the road that we continue to support not only the funds that are here, but'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the two compliance officers that are here as well on the table. And so. I'll leave it there for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Calcium for your ring. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. This has been a long discussion tonight. Also, it's been actually a long discussion for the last two years. I recall when we first when I was first running for council, this was an important issue to the public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wage theft was huge. Also, minimum wage. We're there now. We're here at that point where we're actually ready to take a vote on this issue. I'm somewhat disappointed and I want to be clear on that, that, you know, we didn't really or we are not moving away from the ordinance that we had that we adopted a few'",
        "'speaker_2': 'weeks back, a few months ago in terms of doing it the Long Beach way. It was a very aggressive methodology that we were going to use. And I think because we were that aggressive, I think we actually led the field and let the state to also get aggressive and get ahead ahead of us by adopting a minimum'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wage that led to a path to $15. So, you know, I think that the city council needs to take a lot of that credit because of its aggressiveness in pushing $15 a year before the state. So I'm really pleased with that, the fact that we're now moving towards in another direction in adopting the state's plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So, I mean, we're going to be moving towards the end and it's not it's not bad. However, the other part of it, in terms of the enforcement aspects of of wage theft is and always has been a very important, important component in this path to $15 an hour.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I'm very pleased with with the motion that that is being that is setting the table now in my I would think are beginning to set a pattern here that, you know, enough of studies, enough of investigating this or investigating that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's be aggressive, which we are. Let's adopt this proposal of a path to 15. Let's get two enforcement officers there, which would be awesome and let's fund it. I mean, there's nothing that says more about who we are as a city council and as a city than to put money where our mouth is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's fund it. Let's stop it. Let's get it together so that when we are encountering these issues of wage theft. An iPad 215 that we're going to be aggressively investigating it now if we're not allowed to do that, because our city attorney has decided that maybe we're in conflict with the state, so be it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we are we save some money with the state, takes it over, not a problem. But the fact that we have aggressively invested with that, we are going to aggressively investigate it ourselves. I think speaks volumes for us in terms of the city and what we want to do and how we really, really want to support our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'employees and our our workers and anybody who works within the boundaries of the city of Long Beach, I think that speaks volumes about what we are and how we feel about our community. So I'm really I'm going to be very supportive of the the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have one question. However, Councilmember Mongo, you mentioned a committee that Mr. Gonzalez is in charge of. What committee is it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our Burntisland harbor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Entitlements that were the that this would relate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it was just an idea that should the city attorney find the need to look at wage theft, that is a particular committee that has some expertize on it that might be helpful in that the wage theft community that it's come forward most strongly has been specifically in the trucking industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we're we're not sure we need anything additional. We think we are fine. I think we're fine where we are. And I think that we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. But I agree with Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need to make a decision tonight what that decision is. I have one more councilmember to listen to and then I'd like to figure out where I am.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I appreciate that. And again, I will re-emphasize my support for the motion by Gonzales. I mean, excuse me to the amendment that includes Gonzalez is perfect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Supernanny.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I do not have a friendly. I just have a couple of questions, and I just want to. Clarify what Councilmember Turanga just said, that we need to send a strong message, but we also have to be efficient with our funds and that's our fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had a question also about the line that we need to set aside funding tonight. I guess this is for Mr. Mays. Could city council come back at a later date after we study the issue and and come up with some funding at that time?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Okay. I'd also like to just. This is an emotional issue, so I'd like to just provide an analogy. My council district, part of our northern border, is the four or five freeway, which is the state agency Caltrans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right through the heart of my district is PCH and the traffic circle. And both of those are controlled by Caltrans. The local agencies here working with the state agency in those cases is not a model of efficiency. So I think I'd like to recommend that we we look at in detail what is required for enforcement and study'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the issues a little longer before we move forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I just. I appreciate the discussion. I, too, am I'm just very I'm going to just reiterate that I think that the the funds need to be set aside today. You know, this has gone on for way too long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think a lot of us thinking that we had originally gone with the Long Beach way. We've now moved to going with the state alignment and we believe in that. And I think that, you know, there's a seems like the council's headed in that direction, but I think that the wage theft component is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very, very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's extremely important. And we may think that it's not a big deal. And of course, we don't know exactly what this is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Going to look like. There's still a lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of ideas and details to flesh out. We hope that maybe down the road this could possibly be an ordinance we're looking into that what we do have the luxury of having next to us is the city of L.A. that is already enacted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so there's a lot to learn from that. There's a lot to learn in this next year as we are still in alignment with the state. But I think setting aside this money now specifically for wage theft, education and outreach, all of this money will go towards that to ensure that we were we are truly doing what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we can to inform the public of their rights and what they can do and how adding an extra layer of fear of local enforcement. So again, we're going to have to hopefully with this friendly amendment, if it is accepted that to wage the investigators, wage investigators, and then in addition, the $475,000.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then, of course, as Councilwoman Pryce mentioned, we'd love to work with the Department of Industrial Relations to see what other methods that we can do to leverage additional resources with this local office. So I just wanted to reiterate that point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think a lot of people have spoken. I appreciate everybody's ideas. We're certainly open to more ideas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Evolves and gets, you know, bigger and better and who knows what happens. So thanks again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So is it possible for us and maybe this is something for Councilwoman Mango to think about, to set aside the money, which is 770,000 or whatever the case may be, set aside that money and have staff come back with a report back to us on one whether we can even I mean, we're setting aside money'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for something we don't even know that we have the power to enforce. So can we set aside the money and then have staff come back and tell us, can the city even enforce this? And to if we can, what would be the plan of how we're going to use the money?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I don't even know what I'm what we're voting on right now. I mean, we're voting on two investigators and $475,000 to do outreach. I mean, I don't even what kind of outreach are we going to do for $475,000?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what I'd like to do is, is get us in a position where we know what our city dollars are going to. I mean, I, along with a lot of my colleagues, have to we all have to report back to our constituents on where we're spending our money and why.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, a wage theft, there's no doubt about it. And I know there's, you know, heckling and stuff going on. Wage theft is an important issue. Just because someone doesn't vote the way you want, just because they don't give the amount of money that you want doesn't mean it's not an important issue and it doesn't mean'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they don't care about it. And that's just the reality. So let's just stop being divisive and saying, just because you don't give me exactly what I want, you don't care about it. What I'm saying is, can't we educate ourselves a little bit more about I mean, when else have we voted blindly to allocate a certain amount of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'money to something that we don't even know how much it's going to cost? So my recommendation would be, I'm okay if we want to set the money aside, encumber it, don't use it, set it aside. I know that they had 475 listed in the proposed budget, so we're going to have to come up with another 222,000 from'",
        "'speaker_5': 'somewhere. So can we set that aside? Don't touch it. Don't encumber it. Leave it there. It's safe. But we don't actually allocated to enforcement until staff comes back and tells us one we can enforce. There's no prohibition against it in the statute, in the state statute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to this is how we would enforce because I'm not clear right now, we're voting on positions that I don't really know what they would do or how they would fit with the state. It's like it's like hiring some traffic and engineers to monitor the portion of PCH that Caltrans currently oversees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What exactly are they going to do? Because they can't change signal timing. They can't repave the road. There's nothing they can do. They have to work with the state. So I'm not really clear the that of what we're voting on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I understand. We want we want everybody to get a win. And I get that. Let's keep the money. Let's not spend it. Let's keep it encumbered. Let's keep it safe. We won't touch it. But let's find out exactly how we're going to use it before we vote on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would like to actually bifurcate the two issues because that that would to me be the simplest way to to go forward with the vote, because I do want to support us going with the state minimum wage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I. Want to first say that, you know, that this is about compromise, that we're making a lot of compromise today. Whenever everybody in this room, business, community Workers Council, the mayor, I've worked for a long time to do the Long Beach Way and have a Long Beach ordinance so that the wage enforcement part is so'",
        "'speaker_8': 'critical and so important, and that the money that was identified, this 475 was money that we already talked to our budget committee. We already talked to city manager. We already had briefings to figure out what that money would be spent on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the majority of that money was earmarked for outreach. Yes, because outreach and making sure that workers are making a fair wage is in getting the money that they deserve is more important to me than spending money on a fountain, which I know city staff is tired of hearing me complain about spending $700,000 on a fountain.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we can do that, we can spend money and make sure that enforcement locally is being done. And so I had a question for Councilmember. Could we make it? Are we looking to make it a specific ordinance for wage enforcement?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Would that be that might be a city attorney question. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So just to repeat where we are, the current motion on the floor is to follow SB three, which is the state regulations and escalation and all the avenues that have options related to the governors changes and things like that, so that we as a city are following the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One state with relation to the for 75, you are correct that was budgeted and just and we have as a council had I guess eight weeks of meetings related to the budget where those questions could be asked. It actually is a bit more I know that you definitely keyed in on the outreach component.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The 475 is more than just outreach. It's actually some staff in the city attorney's office that are necessary for a couple of things and then outreach as well for CBOs and a few other things. So it's a it's a comprehensive plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And to be fair to all of us, I know that I've had 40 budget meetings between staff and constituents and all the different matters. So I, I have notes in this big pile right here of what the specifics are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But when I discussed it and I believed in it, those were things that keyed up to you. And for me, the staffing in the city attorney's office is key, because one of the components of this is we do not know if we need an additional ordinance or not, but that stuff would be available in the city's attorney's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'office to do that research and that look. And we would not need to make those decisions tonight. We are completely capable to set aside and follow the recommended budget of the city manager and the mayor's proposal, along with the potential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Should I accept Councilmember Gonzalez's motion a friendly which I'm inclined to do at this point? It sounds like that would be the compromise that would really move us towards following SB three, which has been my priority, and I know it's also been Councilmember Austin's priority since the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to do that, we would have to and I know you said the word compliance officers, but I will hope you take the clarification. It's going to be investigators, which are actually a compliance is a reactive versus an investigator, which is a proactive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I knew that that was really important in discussions with the community. And so I hope that that clarifies and unites us as a council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And finally of Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I promise not to make any friendly amendments. Just want to get some clarification.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because I did not hear much about well, what I did here is Councilmember Elina Gonzalez is a friendly amendment, which I support. I just want to get some clarification because I am on the Budget Oversight Committee and we have been kind of massaging our budget for FY17 over the last several weeks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is the intent to make the for 75 one time or structural? It's currently one time okay. And I think that's good because entering into the community contracts. I would hope that there is a mechanism to to a support for accountability and real deliverables.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My hope is that, you know, this wage enforcement thing is not something that is necessary. You know, five, ten years out, maybe we can jump in, get into it immediately, address some issues and really, really work hard to educate and do the outreach and education of the community where it may not be necessary as part of, you'",
        "'speaker_10': 'know, just what is what is day to day operations for the city, particularly. And then these community organizations then become somewhat employees of the state of the city. Correct. So I want to make sure that that that there is some mechanism in place to make sure that there is accountability for the outreach and education and that we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we can have some report backs on deliverables, as we would any other city department that we tasked to do do a a function. So it takes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. See no other council comment. Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going to turn this back over to Councilman Mongo to take action on the friendlies in front of her. And then we're going to go to a vote. And I want to just also make a couple clarifications we think are important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The first is just as a as a reminder. I know it's in the budget. The 475 that is in the budget as presented is for a couple of different things. Part of that money is set aside for the attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we actually bring in an attorney to look at the labor issues, to look at wage issues. That's dedicated to enforcement. The attorney also has support staff as part of this budget for the Force 75. That, as we know, is one time this year, but certainly could could continue on in in years as we go forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's also probably $100,000 of that for 75 or maybe 150. Correct me if I'm wrong, Leah, that's dedicated to education and also work with community groups to ensure that there's actually education happening about wage enforcement and about wage laws.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think, at least in my opinion, that it's been presented that regardless of whether the council was going to go and align with the state or not, that those resources are still needed so that we can do education regardless of that decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At least that's been my impression of the of the conversation. And so that's where I think that 475 is, is going it's attorney enforcement, it's education, it's working with community groups. And and then the friendly motion that's being done by Councilwoman Gonzalez is to add two investigators to the already budgeted for 75, which, in my opinion, is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the beginning and really the creation of a pretty strong wage enforcement and a a this and somebody to address the conversation about wage theft which had been going on in this community for a very long time. And so to the community that's here and I know that there's a difference of opinion on on on a variety of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'things being discussed. But we are going from having essentially no dollars at the city dedicated to wage theft and enforcement to a pretty significant program if the motion and friendly is accepted tonight. So I, I strongly support Councilman Gonzalez's friendly motion to Councilman Mango Councilwoman Price, and then we'll, as anybody else, will go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's since we're voting on two different things. One is whether we have our own city ordinance and another is creating basically a new. Enforcement piece. Can we bifurcate this vote?'",
