But in terms of an overall dollar figure, I know Admiral Kidd playground in particular was probably going to be about half a million dollars in cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's, again, the loss of access for play, too. But we've had, I know, combined park, Craftsman Village Park and just quite a number of them that have had a lot of abuse and misuse that do cost considerable amount of dollars to bring back into a safe condition.'",

We know the damage has been done. And again, this individual with smoking and who knows what could have happened while he was there.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I think this is a really great item that provides an opportunity to establish safe spaces for our children, and that really tells the family that our children continued to come first. So I'm really excited for this and for the city to be able to explore possibilities for kids throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that being a recipient of a playground that combined a park like Director Dennis shared was not very good. I, you know, was negatively impacted, and therefore the children were not able to use that playground. And, you know, because of all the reconstruction that needed to be done.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Spent a lot of time. I can't think of the name of it A Butterfly Park, because butterflies are my daughter's favorite. But one of the other things that I do see and I get kids on them, they're really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that it's it's critical. I think that all park equipment that is put into our city, I've seen in other cities that they say the age appropriate there. So this park equipment is intended for children under the age of 12.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This park equipment is intended for participants under the weight of 225. And I think that that helps because you talk about adults and adults want to help their kids try playground equipment. And I've had a broken slide for a considerable amount of time and we have some amenities adjacent to one another that are intended for older kids'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and then amenities that are intended for younger kids. And occasionally when the older kids that weigh more and might be in high school or they're with their younger siblings, then they're climbing up a slide and they put their foot through it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's a dangerous situation all of a sudden with broken plastic. So I think that weight and age is a great tool and I see parks that have been doing that a lot in the region. I've been to Parks in Colorado and other states, and age and weight I think are really critical on all park equipment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. Thank you, Councilman Hooper, now. Thank you. I'd like to thank Councilmember Allen for bringing this item forward. Director Dennis did not mention it, but Rotary Centennial Park in the fourth District has had challenges for years, and this ordinance would certainly help that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But beyond protecting our existing assets, I see some potential here where with this in place we can look at properties that would not have been considered in the past, and we could build top lights in areas that might have been challenged without this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you again. Thank you. I'll add my comments here. As the dad of two kids under 12, I'm happy to support kids. I think it adds a level of comfort to parent, to know that, you know, there's there's kid activity and kids in the kids own and and it makes us feel good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, I would also say that, you know, I want to make sure that we have that if you establish kids own, let's make sure the equipment inside the kids own. We're proud to let our kids play on because we still have a lot of areas where our playgrounds are just not in great shape.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, in general, happy to support this item on any public comment on this. Okay. No matter.'",

And I think that there's a lot of data to support that. And the pandemic. Really showed how some roles in our families have have really reverted back in times of crisis and need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so having a group of women here to advocate for our health and our economics and all of the things that are necessary to still be an equal partner at the table in moving our city forward is a critical role.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very fortunate. I work for the County of Los Angeles, so very early on I've been enrolled in the updates from their Commission on Women and Girls. And while I recognize that commissions are very lean in the county, in the city, and then we don't have the staff support that are necessary, if you do get to a point'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where you do a report out whether it's short or long, I know that every single one of us females here at the Dyas and many of our male colleagues have newsletters and we'd love to include those updates as a tool for you to reach the many, many women that subscribe to our newsletters.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'be a huge success. And so I think the difference between 80 days and 90 days or 100 days, it's all it's all going to get you into the process of next year's commissions. And so I look forward to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for being here. Of course, we would have loved to have done it earlier, but with all things come, good timing. And with that timing comes great momentum. And I think the momentum is here for you to be the most impactful that you could have ever been, at least during my time in the city.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to thank Councilwoman Allen on her for her leadership on this item, as well as my councilwoman colleagues who have spoken out. Really just want to add on to other comments about how important it is to have this commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because, you know, we saw a public speaker earlier saying, you know, my body, my choice and pro-choice. For a minute I thought it was a pro abortion group. But you know, that that brings to mind just the fight that needs to continue around reproductive justice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that, you know, I started my work with my girls in action where it was a lot about doing such sex education on top of what was a hot pot or not taught at school to then fighting for their right as minors to be able to determine what they do with their body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that continues to be a fight that we need to stand in solidarity with what's happening in Texas, but also just how we need to continue to continue this fight here in Long Beach, as well as overall California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As much as we might think that we are progressive or safe, we can't kind of stand by and think that we are because we have the next generation to empower and educate and support. And I think that the state is this commission will help us do that is not just for women who are in the career field'",
        "'speaker_0': ', too, but also the next generation learning the juggle between whether or not they decide to become a mother, but also having a career and having the support through the childcare and any other issues that your face when you grow older, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I support this item and for my colleague and stand in solidarity with them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council member Urunga. Thank you. And I want to thank my majority caucus on the days. As a member of the minority caucus of Days, I want to add my voice in support of this item. I think it's more important that we work together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nothing that is ever done on the city council is not without the support of. The women and men that comprise the city council in moving our city forward. And that's important as well as in the community. I think it was stated that there were 5050 in the city of Long Beach and what a great way to celebrate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that. And by creating a women and girls commission to address all the necessary issues that need to be addressed. You know where that with the 21st century. And we're still dealing with. Disparity among men and women. We shouldn't be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We shouldn't be doing that right now. So I look forward to the development of this commission. And I have you have my 100%, 110%. Support on this committee that. Thank you. Councilman Cooper now. Thank you. I'm very proud to support this item tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you to the makers of the motion for bringing it forward. I want to hit this 90 day issue again and I'll approach it from a different perspective. I think Zoe Nicholson demonstrated extreme patience with her August 26th celebration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was postponed for a year. I think this body needs to do everything in our power to fast track this and whatever we can do. City Manager, please let us know. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I join in the chorus of support of this item. Again, thank you, Councilmember Allen, for bringing it forward. And I appreciate all of the the hard work, the advocacy that's gone into getting us to this point. As I mentioned in the last item, this is a this is a gut check.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a values vote that we'll take here this evening. We are city council that prides itself on diversity. We're city council that provides ourself pride ourselves on equity. And this is a step closer to being a more equitable city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I can just I know there's a laundry list of issues for this commission to really work on that will will vex the city council to to. To make changes in pay equity is one of them. You know, we want to make sure that pay equity and and and so many other areas that that have been traditionally'",
        "'speaker_1': '. That aside, get up with it to front. And so I'm happy to support this. Thank you. I'll offer my comments here first to thank you to my council colleagues for for bringing this forward. I think it is absolutely critical for the future of our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I personally feel that it is long overdue. You know, the role of cities is changing and has been changing. And when you see that, you know, like my colleague mentioned, the disparities exposed by COVID 19, the recent Supreme Court decision on reproductive rights in Texas, it's very it's a it's a very real issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we need to make sure that we change our organization and commit to systems thinking the steps you've seen in recent years, establishing enough equity, establishing an equity commission, establishing a women's commission. Those are system changes. You change the organization and build capacity for the organization, make better decisions, more reflective of the population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what this is today. So our city will become better. Our decision making will become better because we change our organization to be reflective of the interests and the needs of today and for the future. And so I certainly want to thank you all of the leadership, though.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I saw you just recently. We talked we talked about this. Yes. You will get a second. Yes, you will get a unanimous vote. We're excited to certainly support this. And again, thank you to my colleagues for for moving this forward.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have any sort of metric for the success of this program? Initially, the intent of the program was to take cars off the street and allow for different mobility options. Are we tracking that data? Do we have any way to measure it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and so I think for me, I'd like to get a sense of where we are with the E-SCOOTER program. Does it make sense for us to move forward with it? What enforcement options are available for contractual? Failure to follow the contractual terms and how can we basically improve the quality of life issues for our residents who'",
        "'speaker_0': 'who want the scooters but don't want the the scooters and the the results of the scooter companies that aren't following their contractual terms. And I know that this item also says other mobility share programs. So the other question that I had is what is the status of the item that we passed at council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Probably about a year ago, allocating funds to a ride a bus minibus program that would travel from downtown Long Beach to Second and PCH area and transport people. I haven't heard anything about that program and I'm wondering what the status of that is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure I can answer a couple of those questions, so I'll take the last 1/1. The mobility program, that was an item to do some research and looking to see what it would take to be able to fund some micro transport like we did a free pilot program that's going to be wrapped into the American Recovery Act money'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So now we actually have money to do that. We can go back and check on the status of the report, but we're planning to be able to use some of the Funding and Recovery Act to move that item forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what we were planning to also report on is we we have another mobility program. It's our bike share program. It's been actually around longer than the others. So we were going to that's our other major mobility program that we would report on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we first heard this item, we thought this was a pretty simple report on just the data that we currently collect. And so we have that available. We can get that within 30 days pretty easily. Some of the additional questions we can you know, those are good questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can certainly work on those. It's going to take us a little bit more time. So we took a lot of notes that those are part of the motion. We can put that together and work on a report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And just to be clear, the item regarding the working with the bus company, my understanding is and I could be wrong, but I thought we set aside a specific amount of money and directed staff to engage with a vendor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe it was eight months to a year ago, we specifically allocated specific amount of money from the 12 million extra that we had identified. So that I believe that the money that we had already received and identified and we voted on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, motion was made specifically about that program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct? That was March 16th. There was about $2 million at the time that was allocated. And then just until you adopted your budget, that's when that budget got finalized. So that actually got reduced down to about I'm trying to remember, probably $1.6 million because every allocation had to get a reduction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Before we can start doing the RFP, we had to figure out what that actual amount is and then that will move forward. So there is funding associated with that project that we can work on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I've had similar experiences. I really want to thank Public Works for their work on helping us when all of a sudden 15 scooters are dropped off next to a bus station in a place where they're blocking the walking path and or a wheelchair path of our residents, they shouldn't have to walk into the street to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get to public transportation. So I appreciate public works responding, but I think that the questions that Councilman Price really bring forward really discuss the cost of this program on our taxpayers and the residents and the convenience and the inconvenience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was in Councilman Allen's district the other day over at the park, and multiple scooters were blocking the parking opportunities. And luckily my husband got my daughter on to the grass and one at a time took every single scooter out of the paid parking spaces that were not paying for parking and would not then get a ticket'",
        "'speaker_0': 'taking up parking spaces that are critical and valuable in District two, especially on a weekend. And so I'm very interested. I opened my app at the time to go Long Beach app, and there's an opportunity to put a band in a shopping cart, but there's nowhere to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Abandoned scooter, inappropriate area. We should probably allow community members to track that for us and help us with this kind of challenge. Because I would have gone out and done all 15 of those scooters that were blocking the bus stop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I recognize we're already spending considerable resources. On the flip side, I do hear a lot of benefits. I hear community members that used to ride scooters to Long Beach City College and the such. I think during the pandemic that probably went down considerably and the utilization was very different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward to seeing this data and I support all the questions coming back to us. I think that they're really critical in our ability to evaluate if this is a good fit for us, and I would even be interested to see how it compares with our bicycle data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really think that we need to be in a position to have one of our nonprofit partners, maybe partners of Park, look for us to get a sponsorship. When you go to Chicago, all the bicycles are all sponsored by, I want to say like Kaiser Permanente or Blue Cross or whatever it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's I'd be interested in knowing how much money the city receives to contribute to health and wellness based on those sponsorship agreements. So lots of opportunities to improve the program. And that was a big risk when we took this on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I look forward to hearing the report back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilmember, I do want to add you had mentioned it and so did Councilmember Allen about the ability to report some of these. We have been working for the past probably two months, did add it to the Long Beach app so that we can actually have people be able to respond and get that directly to the vendors'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So that should launch, I believe, this week if it hasn't launched already. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman. And they her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much again, Councilwoman Allen, for bringing this item forward and for those who have signed on. As you know, I'm a big supporter of alternative forms of transportation that are both fun and convenient and also more environmentally friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we do need to be careful with the unintended consequences that they may have. And I do agree with a lot of the statements and requests that Councilmember Price has made tonight in regards to finding an exact data, making sure that we are that we have these mobility, you know, company in our city, but that it's actually'",
        "'speaker_2': 'doing what it's supposed to do and in making it more more friendly to be able to be on e-scooters. And I think that having that data will show if we're actually making an impact in the city as we as we begin to approach more and more citywide events like the Grand Prix and also the other Los Muertos'",
        "'speaker_2': 'celebration, I think it's very important that we are there, that our residents know where, that we as a council are addressing the transportation needs and concerns, both, you know, for parking and also for companies like for mobility scooters and e-bikes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we we need to really, really keep an eye out on making sure that the these these companies that we're contracting, that they have some kind of responsibility to make sure that they're running an efficient and safe business in our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Cubana. Thank you. This goes back quite a while, but there was a request made at one of the early meetings on E-Scooters. And I'd forgotten about this until Councilmember Mongo mentioned the the carts. There was kind of a fundamental flaw in reporting abandoned carts and abandoned scooters.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is still, if you call the phone number for an abandoned car, you'll be asked, what is the name on the cart or whose cart is it? And sometimes there is no identifier in it. So the cart remains abandoned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If they can't be processed and we've got them with the same gear and scooters that the average resident looking at their window or something may not be able to read the name of the scooter on there. So I don't know what's feasible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just know it's been asked before. So if we could look into actually the possibilities on both issues, that'd be great. Thank you. Interesting. I'll just add a couple comments of support. Thank you so much to my council colleagues bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think, you know, we have to continue to refine this system and keep a close eye on it. And I also want to want to say just, you know, broadly, this is one system managed by the city. Long Beach Transit has its own governing authority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Metro has its own governing authority for our transportation system in the city isn't really. I think we can do a lot in terms of coordinating the way that we think about transportation and transit in our city. And we have to think I think we need to think a little bit bigger as it relates to how we manage'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and coordinate with other agencies to have one seamless experience for micro changing and public transit in our city metros looking at fairly systems. You know, there's there are things we can do to think about the overall system. That's not what this item is tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I just want to keep in mind that as we focus on refining this program, we can't lose sight of there's no other agency responsible for convening all of these groups around the big picture of transit in our city, aside from the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so thanks a lot very public comment on this item. Okay. Seeing numbers members, please cast your vote.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. Okay. So so the procedural question I had is so I was one of the recipients of the email asking if I would sign on to the item, but I don't know who else was asked. And so is it is it the case?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is just a clarifying question. I answer don't know the answer to this question. If you ask three colleagues to sign on to an item and let's say one of them signs on and two and says, you know what, I'm not interested in signing on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't support that. Are you then precluded from asking someone else to sign on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then do you have to rewrite your I mean, then what do you do? The item can't come forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You could still bring the council member could bring an item forward by themselves. You may not be able to put it on the supplemental, but you could bring it forward as an individual council member. And that's why I would strongly encourage you to consider a policy where you limit it to three total council members, because that's where'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the BRANNICK violation occurs is by the now we've shared this and reached and maybe had a debate and as Council member often points out, this was maybe chiefs of staff, two chiefs of staff, but that's attributable to the council office.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that information has been shared and the courts have been really clear. Aye, aye. Like button shared on an email account could be a brannick violation if five council members just hit that. So you don't have to have substantial debate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It just has to be outside of the public forum with more than a majority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So yeah, I understand that. Nine Appreciate that clarification. I mean, there's been times where there's been four people on an item and then someone on that item has sent me a text or reached out and said, Hey, I want to talk about this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've said, I can't talk to you because there's already four people on the item and I've known that that was an okay, but I didn't know that if somebody refuses to sign on the item, which I think is what happened here, then you're precluded from bringing it forth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If four people had been asked.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. Because now you've you've discussed it with a majority of the members outside the presence of the council out of the public meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understood and I appreciate that clarification. So so I guess the only thing we can do tonight is receive and file on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That that's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. Okay. Thank you. Not on the mango. Thank you. I guess I have a couple of questions. One is that I choose not to sign on to items or to sign onto items without providing any feedback to my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ever. I mean, often. I don't mean ever. Often, because I'm not here to block them from getting another signer. I can think of a time where Councilman Price and I may have agreed on coyotes in the city, but at the time she had asked me to sign on to an item and I did not tell her whether'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I supported or did not support the item, just that I was not prepared to sign onto the item. What she did not know is that I was working with the university on my own item and I just chose not to participate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that was, in my opinion, not a discussion. And I think that gaining consensus is really the intent of the Brown Act. And in no way do I feel that a council member, especially in this case, choosing not to sign on to the item, is getting us towards consensus, especially when a lot of our chiefs of staff'",
        "'speaker_0': 'knowing us individually, know our positions generally and sign on or don't sign on or recommend because sometimes it's just not the time. And so I guess I would say that I've actually consulted two attorneys because I was very shocked that this was a potential Brown Act violation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this particular individual who has served as a city attorney to other cities has stated that their position is that it's on building a consensus around an item or about a discussion, which I don't think either of which happened at this case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while I respect your opinion, Mr. City Attorney, is it not a justification and opportunity as a board to still move forward with the item and deal with the potential remedies that are required? And if so, what do you believe those remedies would be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, first, I totally disagree with your comment. I think that this is a Brownback violation if you act on it and if you debate it this evening, because the letter in which is in your agenda package was shared with a majority of the council members outside of the meeting before the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so taking an action, your action would be considered null and void. And your direction to the city manager in this case would be come back. You would have to rescind the action and then reconsider it to try and cure it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you're you're not. Plus, it could be referred to the PPC and potential fines and penalties. But I think if I'm giving you what I believe is practical advice here too, is how do we fix this and cure it and move forward?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can certainly have a longer debate on what you believe is reaching a consensus or reaching an agreement, and that would be facts specific on each one of the times when you're looking at the Brownback violation. So you can't have a general statement that says, well, if I just didn't talk to him, I didn't violate Brownback.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's not how it works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I respect that. I also read every single agenda item every single week. And so every single agenda item is shared with the majority of the council in advance of the discussion of the item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that's true. When the agenda package goes out to the public. At the same time you're talking about before the item is submitted to the city clerk is what I'm talking about for consideration are placed on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if the media shared the agenda item publicly in the local news with that potentially and we read it, would that be a violation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you communicated with your members of the council about it or their staffs of your offices, communicate with each other. Yes. Look, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Didn't communicate that. That's I think right now you're assessing that there's a potential branch violation, but there hasn't been discussion with me or I don't know any of the other colleagues I know, not me, about if it was potential that I had a discussion with Councilmember Asad about this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we received the package and you signed on to the items. It's assumed that you read the item and agreed to sign on to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was asked if I wanted to sign on to an SB ten SB nine item by my chief of staff, and I said Yes. That agenda item, if you checked my email, has not been opened and has still not been open to this day just because I didn't have time to open it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I guess going into these details is important, and I feel that there's a little bit of procedural gaming going on because we already had a position stated by I. Just another point the committee is Councilmember Austin Councilmember Muranga and Councilmember Richardson all stated their opposition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If Council member Austin would have come to other members of the body. And not the members of his committee would be have also had the violation. I just don't know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure I'm following your logic here, but I think that the if the question is, could the council member, Austin, have approached someone other than on the pub on the state led agenda to bring this item forward?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The answer is yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Even though they also publicly already stated their position on the item in committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The question was whether the person on the state led committee could approach a different council member not on that committee, to ask them to sign on the answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On an item already heard by the committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I think we're always learning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just want to say I think we need to be cautious with the president with that and there's elected official and let me just say, I don't believe Councilman Alston was intentional or anything. I think it was a procedural mistake among chief of staff of a previous chief of staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand. But this is not where we should split hairs or cut corners or debate whether or not if you want to have a council discussion and a study session on the Brown Act, we certainly should do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But trust in public officials has waned. That's the truth. And we shouldn't cut corners. The city attorney had a recommendation. I think we should respect that recommendation. His recommendation is also to go from 4 to 3, because this isn't the only time this has happened.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we should, you know, rather than accuse gaming of the system, we should just follow the rules and do what's supposed to be done. And I don't think this was intentional. But the accusation of gaming the system is just knowing the rules and knowing the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we should follow that process and move forward together, protect our city, bring the item back, and we'll have the debate that you want to have. But that's what I think we should do. How come the Super Bowl?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Two things. This this question is procedural, number one. And number two. I was not asked to sign on to the item, so I think I'm in a safe zone here. So my question would be, moving forward, if this were to be heard one week from tonight, that would require a supplemental to be submitted by noon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'on Friday, which requires three signatures. Am I correct on that? That's correct. Okay. So is it the opinion of the city attorney that that could be accomplished? Based on the conversation we've had here tonight? That's a very good question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I believe the answer is yes. I mean, what the allegation is this evening and what I'm dealing with this evening is the item before you on the agenda tonight was delivered to and discussed by at least by the staff members, five members of the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I am encouraging not to consider that tonight to re agenda is it to cure it. So if if for example, the council violated the Brown Act, generally speaking, the one of the remedies could be to place the item on the agenda and rescind the action taken by the council to cure it and then reconsider that item'",
        "'speaker_1': '. The that so in essence, that's what you would be doing. You would be saying we could put this forward. And for example, the council member from the eighth District wouldn't couldn't maybe doesn't put it on the supplemental, but a different council member puts it on and gets two other people to sign it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no Brown Act violation there. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for that. And I'm going to guess your recommendation. We'd have only three people sign that supplemental. That would be my recommendation. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To follow up on the procedural questions of council member super or not, does the item need to be any different than the item that is before us tonight?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This particular item? I think the answer is no. I mean, you're asking and going to have a discussion or a debate, I assume, on the merits of whether you're going to ask the governor at this point in the legislation to veto the legislation that's carrying on is apparently on the desk of the governor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think the answer is no. It does not have to be any different. You just need to bring it back. And it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will have an.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Elevation outside of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every member of the dais before it was filed. I think that's my concern. Am I wrong? It has now been shared with every member of the staff before it was filed. So why is it not the same violation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Margo Let's be respectful of everyone's time, but we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Richardson, I think you have already accused us of trying to cut corners, in your opinion, as welcome and appreciated. But thank you. For your opinion of my time. This is an important item to my district and my council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like my completion on the agenda so we can debate it. We did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you broke the Brown Act, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did not make the accusation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin. Thank you, Mr. City Attorney, for winning and explaining your position. Again, I take full responsibility for the the procedural error, and I look forward to debating this matter next week and taking the position one way or another at the full city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think this this this item deserves our attention. And we are clear on how to how to move forward. I move to vote. Fantastic. Very public comment on this item. It's like there's one. Janet Foster.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, everyone. I'll be back next week. But I just wanted to ask your support of SB nine and SB ten. And primarily it's because these two bills will contribute to building housing that we so need, and Long Beach needs to be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know their views about what neighborhoods, but their neighborhoods that are bearing the brunt of a lot of the development. It's not shared equally. I think that we can talk about this a lot more reasonably than I think what fears that are out about what type of housing being built?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who gets controlled? What does a neighborhood look like if this is allowed? I think it can be reasonably done. But I just wanted to be here in support and to ask the city council to not not lobby the governor about this, but let it stand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've had great representation locally who stood who stood and supported this. And I'm here for Long Beach, Yimby, the Long Beach Yimby chapter. So I'll be back next week. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. No further public comment. Members, please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion is carried.'"

        "'speaker_1': 'You're on a roll with unanimous vote, and this is certainly worth that. Since July 6th, so much has happened. It's been extraordinarily active and exciting. The Department of Parks, Recreation, Marine interviewed candidates and selected an outstanding new conductor.'",
