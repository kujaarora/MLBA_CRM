        "'speaker_1': 'Item 14 is communication from Councilmember Pierce. Councilwoman Zendaya's recommendation to receive and file a presentation from the People's Budget Coalition on the proposed budget proposal, FY 2021. You're right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'll turn it over to Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much. I know that we've never done a presentation like this before in council. I think the budget has been organizing with different nonprofits and organizations for several years. I think officially presenting a people's budget for the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I could be wrong there, but we thought it was important just to hear a presentation. I know they've made lots of requests. I recognize that this budget year is a extremely tight budget year. But we thought since they've done so much work around this, given the historical context, that we give some space for them to present today'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I have not had a chance to see the presentation yet, so I look forward to seeing this today and hearing from my council colleagues. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Having me. We have them on the line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a question for the court.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember, what was your question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe the clerk has them lined up to speak, got for the presentation. So I was just putting her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ailsa Chang, are you on the line?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, we're here. And this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kids like Elsa and Dawn. I believe you guys have 10 minutes, so if you'd like to go ahead and get started. Great. Thank you. So good evening.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mary Finn Anthony Pearce for incentivizing our presentation tonight. Next slide, please. Mayor Garcia, you recently posted on social media your support for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'BLM and racial justice, as have other council members. And some of you have said absolutely nothing and your silence speaks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Volumes to the actions that you take today are far more significant than your platitudes on social media. You got to make the tough decisions tonight to ensure our whole city's values are actually reflected in this budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next slide, please. We are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also here tonight because of police violence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Corruption and your negligence as mayor and council members. We are not here because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We condemn what happened in Minneapolis or in Kansas City. But what is happening right here in Long Beach. Because you, mayor, city council and city manager, past and present, have enabled this violent police department. You support corruption without BP and their police officers association allowing you to operate with impunity and zero accountability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over five years, the Post spent more than $860,000 on the mission of benefiting our BPD. And so purchasing you and other political candidates like Sandy Allen in exchange for you to protect their killer cops and to buy your silence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the way you are, like the way when they snuck in Article.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nine of their email you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'September 17th last year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To hide their vinyl record. Next slide, please. We are here not just because of your connection with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The place, but the department's own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Corruption.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Killer cops using tiger techs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To delete.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Records.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Destroying hard records.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And aiming guns at innocent protesters like Dante Parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The loner threatened to have his.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Toddler taken away plotting to murder activists like Sun King smiling Talons coins praising their violence. Mangold neglects to address the white supremacist vigilante murder.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of Frederick Path. And you all historically allowed seed money to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Run the seed and retaliate against Tomas Gonzalez after he thought your health costing taxpayers another 700,000 plus dollars. This is why you have to defund the Arab, please. We are also here because of this department's murder. With impunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You turned a blind eye to Don Tasered and sat on his back three times, mistaking cell phone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For a gun.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Officer Hernandez murdered for Murad when he needed care which firemen were providing. Six officers murdered Lionel.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Wine cream salting and the largest jury verdict for cop killing in Long Beach hit $39.8 million. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This and more is a reflection of your collective magnanimity. You have enabled.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And supported these murders of our sons, our daughters, our brothers, sisters, neighbors and friends. Who will be next?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next slide, please, Gabby.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We all know that repeal consumes 44% of our general fund and 240 million taxpayer dollars, most of which goes to pay the salaries, benefits and overtime of more than 850 cops. But what is the true cause of racist, violent policing?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next slide. Since 2014, the city has spent more than 31 million to settle 61 excessive force in wrongful death lawsuit against LPD. That's more than Baltimore, Minneapolis, Denver and Oakland have paid for police lawsuits. This law shows only the top four highest payouts, but this settlements are just the tip of the iceberg.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next slide. They'll be PD almost never fires or disciplines, officers involved in killings or injuring people. Legal records dating back to 2007 showed that in 65, LPD officers have been involved in committing violence against community members, including 28 officers involved in killing people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is just the small subset of violent officers with official legal complaints against them. Most of these violent officers and killer cops were still on the city's payroll as of last year. Not only are these battling cops still out here policing the community, they're actually rewarded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'OLB PD has promoted at least 12 of the Bailin cops to ranks of Sergeant and lieutenant, including the cops involved in the killings of Lynette Gibson, John, the real Mike Gordon, Jenny and Jason consistently. The city has paid this 65 billion and killer cops more than 52 million in salaries and benefits in the years following their violent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'offenses. 52 million doesn't even include the cost of access, insurance and city attorneys who defend violent cops. Next slide. All of these numbers and all of this cause points to a toxic culture and system of white supremacy that you all bought to protect and expand every time you throw more money at police and less and less money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as systems of care. LAPD is not just a few bad apples, but a whole rotten orchard, one that protects and rewards repeat offenders like officers Salvadore Latorre and Jason Kirk, both of whom have killed multiple people and caused the city millions of dollars in payouts and salaries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And because of this negligence of successive mayors, councils and city matters, Long Beach taxpayers continue to foot the bill for violent and killer cops year after year, while police continue to terrorize black communities in communities of color. Next, life choice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All of this is why we're calling on you to defund OPD and reimagine community safety. Our communities need care, not cops. We're calling on you to divest from LAPD by at least 20%. That's $50 million for the budget shortfall and then reinvest the remaining 20 million into the people's budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any other essential services like community health, libraries and parks. Next slide, please. When we divest from BP, we must reinvest in black lives and communities of color. One We must reimagine community safety without police terror grounded in restorative justice and black empowerment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two We must establish dedicated funding to build affordable and supportive housing. Three, We must invest 4.4 million to provide a right to counsel for all renters to reduce evictions and prevent homelessness. Or we must invest 700,000 to establish a rental housing division to communicate with both tenants and landlords and enforce tenant protections.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next slide, please. We must create Community Health Councils for community led crisis response or mental health and safety. Six We must provide free job training for black residents and revise the city's project labor agreement so that black contractors and workers benefit from union jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seven We must invest 2.3 million fully funded language access and finally create a culture of language justice by moving service in-house. Eight We must boost senior and youth development programing and supportive services. And nine finally, we must invest 400,000 to renew and expand the Long Beach Justice Fund to provide free, universal legal representation to our immigrant neighbors'",
        "'speaker_1': 'facing deportation. Next slide, please, for Maniac. Unlike the city, unlike the city of Long Beach, true reconciliation, as applied by the people of Australia, Canada and South Africa is based on a few key principles. Led by the victims, those who were harmed, and to the perpetrators of the harm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city of Long Beach and the Elbe PD. They must be truthful in their testimony and conciliatory in their tone. This is key because Chief Luna, LAPD and the PSA have not been apologetic nor conciliatory, even after the facts of historical racism and discrimination have been proven and exposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Instead, we see political assassination plots, social media posts filled with lies and scare tactics and outright bragging of their violent history with their backs in boots challenge coins. When it comes to equity, black citizens in Long Beach have been at the top of all the negative statistics and at the bottom of all the positive ones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These facts are why the city itself declared racism a public health crisis. This is why EUR 1.5 million for racial reconciliation is simply a joke. Defunding the racist police by 5% is not enough to address the true needs of the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are calling for a true victim led process where at least 20% of the LAPD budget is divested and reinvested in the people's budget. And those who have been harmed the most, the black community. You were elected by the people to represent the people, not the police department.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have the power to begin to overturn the culture of systematic racism and white supremacy in City Hall and the Elbe PD. Do not wait for another viral video or another multimillion dollar payout. Do not wait for another innocent life to be taken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be bold and be brave and be a visionary. Leaders of the people that we elected you to be. History can be on your side if you make the right decision. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're happy to ask questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. Well, that was a unique presentation for the council. I think that you guys spoke from your heart and your experience, and I appreciate the moment. I know that this is probably not a comfortable presentation. It wasn't 100%, I think, what people were expecting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want us to focus on the fact that what the message here is that you guys have a platform of things that you've asked for. And whenever people ask, where does the money come from? You're looking at those departments in the city where you feel like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That should come from. And I know that there will probably be maybe some discussion on this item or maybe on the budget item. But I really wanted to focus on the requests that were made around the housing work, the language access work, and that that was the purpose of this presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate your guys time. I'm not sure if there's any other council comments, but that's those are my comments. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't I don't see any. I'm will go to the comment on the item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our first speaker is Daniel Arturo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. I'm calling in support of the adoption of the People's Budget in support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everything that was just presented. I strongly do not believe the police make communities safer. My name is Daniela Carroll. By the way, I don't know if I said that and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that even.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With the proposed budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cutting, the small amount.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's being cut from the police budget, they're still going to be better staffed than most of our other departments in our library or health or parks and economic development departments. And I don't find that acceptable. I believe that providing legal defense and rental assistance for Long Beach residents needs to be a priority, along with language access, of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'course. And I think we need to re-imagine a long beach in which we are hiring social workers and librarians and afterschool tutors and people who could make the city more equitable. And I just want to end in saying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And advocating for adopting the people's budget. And reallocating funds and additional resources on an ongoing basis to community led priorities that create health, opportunity, community and justice. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is John Miller.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you hear me? Yes. Hi. My name is Jemima and I am a community organizer with the Long Beach Immigrants Rights Coalition. I am here today because, again, I am disappointed by how little our voice matters to the city council mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Every time I leave the city council meeting, I think to myself, what could we have done better to be heard by city council? What can we do to make them realize that they are witnesses of literal murder task by police?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They honor and accept money from grandmothers. Mother's daughters are here. Tell you what, they need to keep their community safe. As you ignore them, the children are listening. I will say this again, and the generations after me will continue to say this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The police are murdering black and brown communities, and you're allowing this to happen by giving them the resources to do it. Taking a stand is defunding the police by 20%, not taking pictures and with protesters with fists in the air while continuing to get police funding.'",
        "'speaker_5': '40% of the city's general fund police violence has to stop. And you are now in a position of power to make that happen. Tonight, you had the choice to make the right decision to be brave and listen to the very people you swore to represent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Defund the police and fund programs that will give renters the opportunity for legal representation. Yes, this will prevent homelessness. Renew the justice fund. You'll be able to unite immigrant families and keep them safe from deadly conditions in detention centers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Renew it by 400,000 with 50,000 to go to lba.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is melissa garlick.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi there. Thank you, mayor and council members. My name is Melissa GARLICK. I'm testifying on behalf of the Vera Institute of Justice, specifically to investment in the Long Beach Justice Fund. We've been proud to partner with the City of Long Beach as part of our safe network, as a leader in creating a legal defense fund that advances'",
        "'speaker_5': 'universal representation for Long Beach residents facing detention and deportation. And as part of the People's Budget proposal, we urge you to support $400,000 for the Long Beach Justice Fund for FY 21 and as part of a permanent component of Long Beach City Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As the devastating impacts of a public health crisis meet the harms inflicted by systemic racism, the accumulation of injustices facing immigrant communities, communities of color, black immigrants has reached a tipping point, and its consequences will continue unless communities take action.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now is the time to examine the city's police budget, reimagine public safety and invest in communities. The stakes are high. Immigrants of color who are racially profiled and criminalized are funneled into the detention and deportation machinery. Communities need local investment and programs that protect communities of color and immigrant communities and language justice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Science is an investment in keeping together families and communities who are criminalized and targeted by overpolicing and increased immigration enforcement. It's a widely supported program that ensures lawyers on the front lines fighting every day for the health, freedom and due process of immigrants in detention.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Support for this program is needed now more than ever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Norberto Lopez. Gilberto Lopez. Roberto Lopez. Your time starts now. Jordan. Jordan, during your time starts now. Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Jordan. The people's budget has been demanding defunding LAPD for years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the councilmembers who say they don't understand what divestment is or they don't understand any of this, I have to ask, were you not paying attention during those meetings? Because I know recently council members have been leaving during certain parts of meetings, as we saw last week, when certain council members had to be texted and brought back'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in. So I just wanted to say that it is frankly insulting that the people's budget is getting a presentation after all these years, on the same day that you're passing a budget and you're not making any significant changes to the budget or delaying it or really taking into consideration all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Richardson, in a few meetings ago, you specifically asked the city manager about your reconciliation process. He told you that? There would be hearings in October, but it's not relevant to the budget. Blah, blah, blah, that type of thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I have to ask, what is the point of your reconciliation process if it has no impact on the budget and the police still get all this money and we can't fund any of the demands of the people's budget or close the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Funding shortfalls this year without cutting essential services. If the reconciliation process happens after the budget passes, if nothing changes at the budget, how will the police have been reconciled? How well anything have changed? Defund the police and take a bold stand against police violence, divest from BPD and then invest differently in our community health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Norberto Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tony. Hello?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Yes, I'm calling my name as the term project director with Libra, and I'm calling in support of people's budget and hoping that the city council can adopt it. We're calling on the city to really look at the needs of the community and not the needs of the police'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or the developers. We've been asking for the people's budget for a year. You know, we had a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Presentation today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's not enough. What we're asking for is for direct action and for you to actually adopt what we're asking for. We're asking for a housing division. We're asking for more affordable housing. We're also asking that there's a right to council program in the city to help tenants out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We really, really, really need you to defund the police and fund community initiatives that really help out the people that need it the most, not funding people who make twice as much or even three times as much as a community member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're really asking you to defund the police and adopt the people's budget. Thank you. Thank you. And now we're going.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To move to the Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interpretation, interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Portion of the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Comments or give us a moment. And. The first speaker is Elizabeth Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lisa Gonzalez Primero. What, autumn?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here may.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be number 25 as one palace.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Thomas. And you put this together. George Wallace may nominate Palin. My name is on, and I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To give.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A check. I'm going to tell you that I'm very disappointed in regards to this participation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But he made it. First of all, how about another?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I couldn't hear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Noninvolvement in that and interpret that as. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I couldn't understand what the interpreter was saying.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Norah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I feel that I'm being a general.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is back home in Colorado and there's the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to keep getting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Close to each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to really feel that I am being heard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Jennifer, see that one point there? We see open up all there and they're all communication willingly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need good service so that we are able to have good bilingual communication getting there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They look, they start Orlando.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to have the actual fluidity of what is actually being seen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As everyday symbols. Para la policia the man has gone and banged the policy into. But I make them say, re-issue the production.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I still think that we need to defund the police of at least 20% so that we are able to improve the language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sundance, L.A.. I see that excuse that a lack of money that. He dissembled for not being supportive. And so I feel that we are up on that clinical development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. We're having trouble with the translators line. Give us a moment. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They cannot hear me. Okay. Can you hear me now in English? Yes. On muted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we can hear you now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Did you hear the whole interpretation of what was said just now or. No?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. You cut off about halfway through the interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Where? What was the last thing that you heard? Because I have it here in my notes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She requested a 20% reduction in the police budget was her last comment that you translated to us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, so we put a request for 20% budget at 20% defunding of the police from the budget because that would really help the great needs that we have in the community, for example, that would really have the major language needs that we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I do feel that we're not being heard in for example, defund ment with 20% would also help opening our mental health clinics. That is also something that could be done with that. And that was the last thing that she said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Jose CU. When I started in the scooter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good afternoon. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My scooter when I started.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Clean yourself a scooter. My kitchen staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Feel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. We've periprocedural and dosing your lecture context today. I think young people think that, but that is all about meeting me. Interpret that in a moment. But I saw this thing, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I started mean cassava. He used to assemble not only a of this computer. I said, Do you mean that? Suppose you keep that in the present. Okay. But beneficial. The person that here in this house in Houston meant the eagerness of into policy to kill a policy are also all my loser paracetamol troublesome Mr. Comunidad attempted'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the galore gay then if he said he I thought to be my on this a local in Cousteau e or looked and took the several examples in the way law recourses into policy. You are a moot de la familia.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Good afternoon. First of all, I come here with great humility and with great respect to all of you to really make a call out to you for a 20% a defunding of the police. This really would help the communities that have been unfairly evicted in this case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not only would that help the communities that have been unfairly evicted, but these funds that have been misused could actually be used not only to have the communities that have been unfairly evicted, but it would really mean great support for communities such as myself that have gone through that situation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, for example, went through this situation. I was evicted. I'm fairly and justly with five kids, without any assistance whatsoever, without any other way of protecting them, processing it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get in there. Stop it this long. Get your stupid end or get your crooked appointee up. It was sort of a course of Jeopardy era and said, benefit yourself. But I'm a sort of la comunidad thinking that I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Title. I think that the police has a lot of resources and that could be very beneficial for everybody in the community in general. Seek out senior.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See Novello and specifically the Una comunidad is by now and they get out.

        "'speaker_3': 'That's great. Thanks. So this is an item that, you know, our city council and our staff have had many conversations around different mobile service units. And I know that we have stopped behind the scenes working on it. Myself and some of my council colleagues had a generalized presentation on the Hart team that we did not officially get'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the full presentation like we typically do. So we wanted to take just 5 minutes today. My goal is to be able to just look at some other safety models and to hear from council colleagues so that staff can kind of hear from all of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a receiving file presentation that I just thought would be really helpful to be able to keep us in context so we can go to the next slide. So right now, we're in a moment of of the framework of reconciliation, a global call for a new public safety model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our our very own Long Beach Police Department propose over 5% cuts to the Department for Justice, local and national call part of this change, this call for global change. The city had already taken several steps to invest in community before the police need to intervene.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Such things as suicide prevention plans, violence prevention plans. We've got quality life officers, our heart team. And so this presentation is really looking at mobile crisis intervention services to support service first response to people experiencing mental health, substance abuse and homeless related crises.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next slide. So these are a couple of slides taken from the last Hart Team presentation. So in November, November 30th, 2016, the homeless team was created and their mission statement was to reduce the number of fire department responses to individuals experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were going to do this by being able to respond to 911 calls, working with the continuum of care partners and educating fire service and community members about local resources and issues. So really, the Hart team is specific to those that are struggling with homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next slide, please. And the first two years of the Hart team, they had over 3000 contacts with persons experiencing homelessness. 1700 of those contacts originated as nine on one calls, which the fire department were initially dispatched, and more than 96% of the 9911 calls, they were the first ones to reserve on to arrive on the scene.'",
        "'speaker_3': '80% of those cases, Hart was able to cancel the responding fire engine paramedic rescue or both. This is really where we were looking at. The Hart seemed to be a cost savings apparatus for us, not just an additional group of people that could go out, but to ensure that we didn't have to have so many people come'",
        "'speaker_3': 'out to the scene. In 2018, they responded to over 8000 calls where the chief complaint was quoted as behavioral. Also in 2018, they had two certified members that were certified in mental health first aid. Next slide. So we have our police team as we go right now in the proposed budget, we have two quality of life officers'",

And we in this budget, what was proposed by our police department was to move 16 police officers and shift them from community service or shift them from being sworn officers to community service assistants for level three calls'",
        "'speaker_3': '. What's currently in the budget that says that these are on uniformed, unarmed civilians trained to investigate and document specific property based crimes? So at the end of this presentation, I'd love to hear a little bit more from PD just on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I wanted to give us a full picture of what we have right now with those that can respond to 911 calls on top of our health department. Next slide, please. So other models that we're talking about today, a lot of people have heard of the cahoots model, which is based out of Eugene.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The City of Orange has a cap model. L.A. County has our team, which Long Beach does get access to. But sometimes that team does not come out cannot come out on the same day that they're called. San Diego also has a team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of these models go beyond what Long Beach has. Some of these models work not only with homelessness, tenant landlord issues, wellness checks, addiction, suicide, violence prevention and wound care medicine management, which is something that I've learned a lot for our older adults, as well as isolation and loneliness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lyft assistance and chronic users are frequent fliers, as they're called. Do you see some of these other models really go beyond working just with homelessness, but they really touch on different areas. Every city and every county has different teams.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's paramedics, public health nurses, mental health crisis people, EMT firefighters, nurse, psychiatric teams, community organizers and dispatch team. Next slide, please. So the reason for this conversation, I think and I want to say how much I appreciate getting to check in with Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that the cahoots model, possibly a white bird, will be presenting at the bossy, but I wanted to make sure that we had a full picture of the different areas that a mobile crisis intervention service team could provide for the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It really helps fill that gap with first responder services that alleviate the burden placed on police and fire to respond to individuals experiencing emotional distress, intoxication or homelessness effectively provides police and fire more time to respond to crimes and life threatening emergencies respectively.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can go on to the next slide. You need to read all that. So a little glance at the Cahoots model. It was created in 1989. I want to thank White Bird Clinic. This information I received from them last year, the Cahoots Model handled over 24,000 calls, about 20% of the calls dispatched by 911.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their teams are comprised of medics, a nurse, EMT and a crisis worker. And so from my conversations with them, I think that they're able to utilize those that can respond to 911 calls, which is very different in California than Oregon, which could be our heart team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But possibly there's other team members out there like crisis workers, people that can respond to even the lower level calls. Next slide, please. For cahoots. They say that it alleviates the burden placed on public safety. They have proven de-escalation situations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They create data that's accessible for all public safety departments, medical evaluations, wellness checks. And on the Oregon program is an affordable program. Next slide, please. So really, as I mentioned, I wanted to present this just to make sure that we were able to hold a space to talk with staff a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that our health department is already working on this. I know that the body just put in their recommendation to extend the Hart team for another six months. So really, this is an opportunity for us to say, let's really work with the Council, all the stakeholders, and focus on outcomes, not necessarily focusing on the name of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the program. But I wanted to hear from our council colleagues what you would like to see from an outcome and outcome from a model like this. For me, I've thought a lot about 911 response having train dispatchers, making sure that services are available for housed and unhoused, and that there's an alignment with our strategic plans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Suicide and prevention. Suicide and violence prevention. Our youth strategic plan or older adults plan. And possibly opportunities to work with Cal State Long Beach in a social work program. So that is my very brief presentation, just to be able to hold this conversation and hear from my council colleagues if there's ideas on what staff could be working'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, man. You know. You know, I want to thank the Caravan for Justice, folks, for drawing attention that this kind of service model. You know, I agree that over the years we've had developed developed a need for an innovative, safe safety system that allows for, you know, assessments of mental health and status before assessing the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'person and taking corrective action. You know, we know that these model works because I say that because I want you to look at the team, the homeless outreach thing, our quality of life team. We put compassion and aid, aid before enforcement.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I know I have other counsel comment. I'm going to go to public comment and they'll come back to the council. So let's go ahead and do public comment, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have children during. Hello, Mayor and City Council. My name is Jordan. I support taking away all the obligations that BP has taken on over the years that they should not take on. They should not be responding to a lot of the calls they respond to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So having crisis intervention and service models and teams that actually take away things from BP and put it into other departments is great. For example, the health department responding to mental health calls would be a huge benefit to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then one premium who was killed in 2017 and there's actually a protest going on right now to honor her, would still be alive if the health department had responded to that call instead of two armed police officers who shot her within 5 seconds of getting out of their car.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the real elephant in the room is the fact that without defunding BPD and altering the budget as it is now, this is all talk. This is all theoretical without significant funding and taking away money from BPD to give it to other departments that will be handling its responsibilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will never actually happen. You can't just expect the Health Department to magically start responding to non-emergency calls with no money unless the budget is changed. None of this will actually matter. Defund the police and take a bold stand against police violence, divest from BPD and invest differently in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Health and safety. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We will go back to the council. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to Councilwoman Pearce for including me on this item. I did want to just make one brief correction, and that is the presentation on this model or models like this is going to be to the Public Safety Committee in our September meeting, not bossy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I look forward to having the discussions because I think there's a lot of good opportunities in exploring other models. And the police department has been very receptive to exploring those and talking about those concepts and public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So so far. Thanks, Councilmember, for for bringing this up. Personally, I think I'm pretty excited about this. I see it as as an important step in the city's taken tonight in the budget. By looking at a new mobile response model, we can look at a number of different models or see some of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ones listed. Cahoots definitely has a lot of public support. I see that, you know, as we led up to the adoption of the budget, as we lead up to it, I see that, you know, there's been more people talking about it and we started to look at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also know, and I'm glad to see in this presentation there were you know, there were other models we should look at as well. But it's not lost on me that this you know, the heart team started with an idea small.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It grew it over time. And now it's time for it to develop into something more independent. It's time to look at, you know, investing in it further. I want to explore partnerships with L.A. County mental health to see if we can expand its role and how they respond with respond to mental health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all of those things are interesting to me. But I also want to say, like, this stuff doesn't happen overnight. We don't just grab another model from another jurisdiction and drop it in and say, Hey, this is the new response model in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It takes time. You have to actually build a capacity for this. There's legal sort of legal conditions that we have that are very different between here in Oregon, here and other states. We have to improve. Here in California, we call this our medicine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's laws that guide this. Anybody, you know, dispatched through 911 or through a different or a different number is there, you know, who has the jurisdiction over mental health? Is it what is required, in my view, with L.A. County?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there additional funding? Can we create a partnership with L.A. County to bring in those resources? All these are good questions, and I'm glad to see that we're taking the first part of the next fiscal year to answer those questions and roll out this model.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so what I see here is an important step that the city is taking, and it's a step that we should take our time to be serious about. And and it's a real commitment that I see here in this budget to exploring this alternative model.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we're if we do it right and if we do it well, this could be a model for our region that allows us to, you know, do an emergency response to crises, mental health and homeless. That is more cost effective, doesn't it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Doesn't you know, it's more cost effective and allows us to be more responsive and build that community capacity based on public health nurses, mental health conditions and and sort of community staff and support. So there's a lot that we need to evaluate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This isn't a short term thing. This commitment that council was making to this will take time. But I'm glad to see that this will happen in this next fiscal year and that we're getting started with it immediately. Those are my general thoughts on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is something I'm going to continue to monitor. I think it's important and and I encourage the city, the public, to pay attention to what this you know, this is this is more than lip service. It's an actual new alternative model, which doesn't happen very often, local government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we need to pay attention to it. We need to support it, make sure that it actually achieve the outcomes that we're hoping to achieve, which is expanding capacity, more cost effective, expanded capacity, more comprehensive health service for our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's what I'm supportive of. Thanks a lot.'",

I've been really interested in seeing an expanded role for service workers in responding to calls, especially around mental health and homelessness. And I think that this is just so, so promising as a way to more directly get those people that the services that they so need and more immediately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that, you know, I when I first heard about the Hart team and the quality of life team that we had within our departments, I was really, really excited. And I've been, you know, super excited to learn from them and see what they've been doing throughout the years and have they have really, really helped us'",
        "'speaker_3': 'out in a lot of ways. So right now, we have a unique opportunity to look further into what things that can be done and what programs can be brought forward. So I'm I'm really excited to be supporting something like this.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They can. Hello. I'm Ellen Jorgensen. I'm a former junior lifeguard and an ocean lifeguard. And I'm here with my younger sister, Paige, who is currently a Long Beach Junior lifeguard. We are here to address the proposed budget cuts of the junior lifeguard coordinator and 10% of the ocean lifeguards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through my five years with the J.G. program, I developed skills in ocean safety, leadership, responsibility, professionalism, and improved as an athlete. I later joined the Cadet program, which prepared me for a career as a lifeguard. I also worked as a cadet intern, a position made possible through the partnership with ILB USD.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This internship gave me exposure to what a marine safety officer does and has inspired me to pursue it as a career. Everything that I've learned from the J.G. program helped me to be successful, and I am now an Ocean Lifeguard with the goal of becoming a marine safety officer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the J.G. program was run by administrative staff, I would not have gained so many skills or exposure to careers in marine safety. Also, if I were to be cut along with 10% of the ocean lifeguards, not only would the beaches be a dangerous environment for the public, but I may lose a chance at pursuing a career'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in marine safety. I respectfully ask that you reconsider these proposed budget cuts, as I hope that the youth of our community can have the same opportunities that I had with my program. With this program, for example, my sister.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I love the city. While I appreciate the difficult decisions facing you with regard to the 2021 budget. I do not support the city's plan to reduce the Long Beach Police Department's budget by $10.3 million, especially at a time when not only has the number of officers serving our city declined in recent years, but our city has grown'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and crime in our neighborhoods is on the rise. I believe these proposed cuts are too severe and that they will have a serious impact on the safety of our communities. Have there even been any detailed studies to determine just how these drastic cuts might negatively affect police response times?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not to mention the many successful outreach programs mentioned earlier. The city must assess and fully understand the potential impact these cuts will have on all aspects of public safety. I strongly urge the city to reconsider and find alternative ways to balance the budget as preserving public safety must remain our highest priority.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. This is Mary Lee Chamberlain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I would like to voice my support for the Long Beach Police Department and discourage you from approving the proposed budget cuts to the department. Our department has been understaffed since a 20% cut in 2009, with the population of over 463,000 people.'",
        "'speaker_5': '792 officers is not enough to ensure the safety and law and order for our city. The riots earlier this year speak to my point. We watched helplessly on television as private citizens businesses were looted and destroyed while the Long Beach PD stood down due to lack of officers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The crowds were so large and out of control that our officers wouldn't have stood a chance if they tried to intervene. While the rate of crime is up in the city, the use of force cases and officer involved shootings are down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe this speaks to the training that our officers have been receiving recently in those areas. I would ask that the City Council not pander to the special interest groups that are demanding the defunding of police departments all over our country.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Instead, do what is right for the citizens, visitors and businesses that our city relies on for its growth, economics and way of life. Encourage you all to strongly consider the impact a cut to our department will have on the community at large.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a longtime resident, I am proud of our Long Beach PD and feel that they deserve to be treated with respect. After all, they're the ones that put their lives on the line every time they put on that uniform.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Nancy Loza.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Eight. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, my name is Matthew Moore, and I just wanted to say that I am against defunding the police or making a budget cut. I've been in Long Beach for over 33 years and throughout these years with police actually on our side helping clean up the neighborhoods in the community, they have been doing a fantastic job.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is very sad and disappointing that we are seeing people who are looking at only what they want to see, especially when it comes to BLM, BMO and all these things. They want to see the bad guys, but they're not looking to the good things that police officers are doing for the community, which is acting upon the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'police. The response to cops is an increase. I am very afraid of that, especially since we're being a better community with cops. I think that it is time for police officers to get their power instead of taking away their power by people who are making a crime.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you do the crime, you've got to do the time. Is that simple. Let's play by the rules. That's all I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Rena Rosales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Hi. My name is Reynolds Wallace, and I do not agree with the proposed police budget cuts, but I think we have a lot to lose by furthering cutting police funding. Crime will continue to increase. We haven't fully recuperated from the 2008 2008 recession.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So your plan on cutting over 50 from police officers, that's a huge question. Who will protect our elderly, our young from other criminals? Not only they live in our city to pacify. As we saw during the initial right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not the protest, but during the riots. Our businesses deserve protection protections. They bring a lot of money into our communities, in our schools or streets or visitors. Our children deserve the protection they need, especially once school commences.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There will be a lot less on patrol. How long will it take for an officer to respond to an armed robbery or burglary? Home invasion? How about domestic violence? And you suggest that Foreign Office staff be replaced with civilians?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that would be a even bigger liability force for our city. We have seen civilians getting hurt in other and other neighboring cities. I remember last year in Garden Grove there was a civilian that was hurt. She was stabbed and she was a large man.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that would be even bring a lot more losses to our city. We all want a safe city. We want. I know I heard some of the presentations and want to hire social workers and go ahead and do it, but not by taking away our sworn positions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can't. If we we should come to an agreement where both social workers and our officers can work together. Why is there two different sides?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Rick Chambers. Good evening, mayor and city council members. I'm Richard Chambers. I'm the president of Long Beach Police Officers Association. The public. Thousands of residents were asked how they feel about police funding, staffing and crime in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They've given you their feedback. I'm urging you to stop and listen to what the majority are telling you. 66% of residents want department funding kept the same or increased. The city's budget survey showed that maintaining a low crime rate is a top five priority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We understand that this is a tough budget, but let's find efficiencies where it makes sense and not allow excessive cuts based on politics or emotions. The proposed cuts will affect critical units in our department, which will affect public safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We ask you to take the time tonight to understand how cutting these critical units will impact safety and response times. I encourage you to ask questions about the cuts and understand the answers before making your final decisions. The cuts to the warrant detail force legally mandated work undone or pushed on to on to others and the proposed'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cuts to the Air Support Unit need your attention. They need to be discussed. The police helicopter is a critical resource for locating and safely arresting violent suspects, for locating missing persons, and for providing homeland security patrols over the port.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Civilian pilots cost almost the same as Warren and provide no savings. We have requested reasonable restorations that can make a big difference when it comes to the safety of our communities. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Cheryl Hill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh. Thank you for your time. Our Long Beach Police Department is not broken. Well, there may be the need for additional training. There is no justification for a general reduction in the police personnel when we are in the midst of increasing crime levels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If anything, I believe that we need an increase in our police presence in the city. The city council seems to be responding to the political wave sweeping the country for the municipalities are bending the knee to social pressure based upon a principle that violating the law is acceptable policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do not believe that the members of the City Council are truly representing the will of the people of Long Beach. If the Council is so confident that the cuts to law enforcement are beneficial to the city, then why not put the democratic vote of the people?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'After all, the citizens of this city pay taxes which pay the salaries of the police department as well as the city council. Are you afraid to put this to a vote of the people? Law and order is the priority of the police department and that is the constitutional duty of the government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I strongly encourage the Council to really understand the consequences of a police force reduction and what it will do to the safety and security of our city. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And give us a moment when we transition to the Spanish interpretation. Our first speakers. Maria Isabel. Luis Elorza. Send your alert to Mexico.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Little picture perfect mandolin, but as a courtesy, the interpreter. Gracias.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. When I started, you know, Maria and I started seeing your president. Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good afternoon. You first met Isabel. And thank you to Mr. Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Continue your thought. And I think with the butter up again and the stuff with other Lombard spectrum was my policy, as momentous policy as.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I am advocating for human rights. But human rights is that protect represent the bullies. How is it that criminals have more human rights than the police? I want more support and more human rights for the police.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Computer came up with a similar strategy that communal policy at end users buying through models but a broader problem that. But without a necessity. That alone not. I put them in the trash. Doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not going to get better. So what is going to happen then? What is going to happen with less police if they have the training? They watch the entire city. They are taking care of the entire CD. Then what happens?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any criminal would be able to get into our houses. Continue continuing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in that particular policy, as long as they're muttering, they've got it in the accounts of what was one of several of them, the reputable government policy in the camp. In this stuff. Leader of Yemen. If so, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what? I mean, we have my policy on the enemy. There's invariably several of longer you have done so far as the end. The support is the one the policy has been etc. so whatever they and this aura I know okay I got of policy forum is more like the longer bang up a reputable feels them up'",
        "'speaker_5': 'pronto go up or you'll hear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what's going to happen is that the police is going to take more time. When we call 911, they're going to take more time. They're not able to come soon because there will be less policemen available. In the 1980s, we had more police than the year 2000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We had more police. It was safer. There were gangs in the neighborhood, but the gangs, as soon as they saw the police, they would run away. They will go away from there. So if we have less police, we're going to have more gangs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Continue. Said Thank you. Our next speaker is Rosa Gutierrez.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Hi, Mayor and council members. I would like to just give my opinion and feedback as a Long Beach resident. Also 35 years. Please do not make any budget cuts. We do need our officers actually more than ever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cuts will only bring chaos fears to the good citizens that do not commit crimes. And if we do replace, you know, regular citizens that you mean by replacing an armed officer with a civilian, it will just be a joke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For an example, criminals don't respect your local security guard at any store. They just keep robbing, just increasing crime in our city. People don't realize that by cutting our budgets, that only means increased crime longer wait times. When you call 911 in emergency situations, the crime will go up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Residents will live in fear. There won't be enough help, support and city order. Period. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and thank you to everyone that has engaged the budget, not just tonight but throughout the whole process. We've had, of course, public comment at all the hearings. We've had the committee, the virtual community budget discussions, we've had the survey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there has been obviously a lot of engagement. So I just want to thank everyone that's participated. We're going to move into the council discussion on the budget and the motions. I just want to just kind of remind the council especially I think this is probably councilman's in the House, his first budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So kind of go over kind of how it works as well. So there is a series of motions that will be made and a series of votes and you probably have those in front of you. The the the first vote will be the mayor's proposed recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second vote is the bosses propose funding recommendations and there amendments to those recommendations. The third motion is just adopting additional expenditures or revenues in the budget book. And typically, if there are other types of discussions around the budget, they almost always happen in the second or third vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The one of those two items, I think most of you know that already and then after those are after those we really get into just votes and I think are pretty standard every year, which are the adoption of fees, the capital improvement project, the Stanley Resolutions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we'll go through all of those votes, but they all have to be voted on separately, just as a reminder. And there's there's a lot of them. So we just we just go through those one by one. So I'm going to go ahead and start the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to make some overall comments before I turn it over to the first motion. And Miss Yoon from the Budget Office will read into the record after the clerk reads the caucus the motion. Ms.. Jung will read the whole documentation that's got to be in all of the items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that will take some time. But she'll do that throughout for all the items for the committee. So I'm going to begin with some general comments. I want to just start by just kind of taking us, I think, back to the work that's happened to get this project to this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to just remind us that this is a $2.6 billion budget and it funds the operations of our seaport or water systems or storm drains or rescues operations. And, of course, all of the other issues that are that are there neighborhoods depend on every single day our parks, our public safety system, our libraries and all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the activities that happen within within this community. At the same time, we are living and leading through this COVID 19 pandemic. This is the largest global health crisis of our lifetime, and it has required us to take a really hard look at this budget and make sacrifices.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the truth is, is that everyone is sacrificing in this budget. There are cuts all across the city, many of which are difficult and many of which required creativity on really on the part of our staff. And I think I want to thank our entire finance team for their just stellar job in putting this budget together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank them greatly for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All their work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Up at the budget, also because of a $30 million deficit largely fueled by this COVID crisis. We've had to reimagine ways in which we deliver public safety and health care services and how we make our investments in infrastructure, homelessness and all the other issues that matter to us and our neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are still in a COVID 19 health crisis, and we have the numbers staggering to me. We have spent already over $100 million just to handle this response. It's been over 180,000 tests have happened in this city. We've sheltered hundreds of homeless individuals that needed shelter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We purchased PPE. We have done contact tracing. And we work with our partners at FEMA and at the state for a reimbursement and to get support for this community. And we've had to fight. I mean, the reason we have CARES ACT funding today is not because we were expected to actually get any when Congress passed the initial'",
        "'speaker_0': 'bill, but because we and other court and another and other coalition of cities fought for CARES Act funding through the state where almost $41 million and an additional almost $40 million to the county to ensure that we had proper testing and support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This pandemic has already cost the city over 200 almost 230 lives and is a leading cause of death in Long Beach. And so this budget is being adopted in light of that crisis and where we have this health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know that's also affected our economy and our economy. It's been fueled with the enormous amounts of unemployment, small businesses that have been really suffering. And I want to just commended this council for stepping up and establishing small business recovery programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are thought to ensure that small businesses would be supported across our community and we are fought for local, federal and state dollars as well. And we have ensured in this process that we work with our city employee groups to come out with fair and responsible ways that we can all contribute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And through furloughs and through other programs across the city. And we also know that we are living in this just incredible moment where we're all moving towards a more just country where we're focused on racial justice and equity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to uplift that within this budget. There is an enormous. Commitment by the city and the council to racial justice and to a breaking down systemic racism that we know exists in all institutions, not just here locally, but about across the country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are there are direct investments and reinvestments within our Long Beach black community, but also other communities of color in health and community, life, crisis response and violence prevention programs. And we know that that that list will continue to grow as as we look at the needs that we have in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have had a difficult but also an important conversation around public health and safety. And the largest police department within this budget has also put forward new models and new ideas on how we can really focus on community based policing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've heard the protests on the streets through actions that have happened within the city. This is a moment where we are also pushed to reevaluate and do better as a city and as a community. We know that within within our own work that we.'",

We have work ahead to reexamine our homelessness and mental health support. A lot of folks tonight talked about the Cahoots program and other programs that exist across the country.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'of the input from exceptional models. There's a lot of good things here, particularly within within the health department.

        "'speaker_1': 'Incredibly important. About 400,000 to support our state. Long Beach violence prevention plan. Upstream violence prevention.

        "'speaker_1': 'That's impressive to be able to get to 40 of the initial 107 recommendations in year one of this budget.

        "'speaker_1': 'There's a few things I want to I want to highlight. I know that we have a right to counsel. We have funding in the mayor's. But no, the right. The council. I have a question with staff on how we plan to to sort of utilize it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's my opinion. I don't think that we should, you know, take any time, you know, creating a new program. The county just rolled out a program I'd love to see. I'd love to see us or us, you know, utilize these funds in in in partnership with the county to leverage our funds locally and work with a local'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So we agree. We would love to contract with the group that has done this work already or has experience doing it. If the county's got a good, sustainable program. We'd like to piggyback on on other successful efforts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would start there and see if there's groups that they have that could expand their services. We think that that could go faster or quicker and bring knowledge, and then we'll work to see if we need to do that through an RFP or other type of model.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fantastic. That's what I want to hear. I think that's the best way to go about it. Thank you. Secondly, I know that there's a community interest in a rental housing division. I personally support this. I support getting there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know it's going to take time to sort of build this capacity. We talked for years about, you know, actually aligning all of our housing work from the housing authority to some of the housing workers and development services.'",

But what the community is really asking for is really some apparatus to really focus on developing a division and actually sort of addressing some of the shifting landscape.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was just a state legislation that just came out. People don't really understand. It's been changing month to month. And we've seen, you know, some of the council offices. We've simply been forwarding out memos and fact sheets from legal aid from other agencies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we should be able to produce our own capacity. So I want to want to ask that I know that there is are funding within the reconciliation for housing equity. And I know that we are already counting on on our our city attorney's office in many ways to evaluate what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are you Mr. City? City, city, Mr. City Manager, is there a way that you could come back and tell us how we can utilize the housing equity position to start putting out notices and fact sheets that are actually city like the city can put forward, not necessarily recirculating things that came from the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How could you respond to this, this interest in a rental housing division?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So we've taken a look at the request for a rental housing division to create something robust like that actually would take some significant resources. We've costed it at around $1.1 million to create a five or six person division with legal counsel and support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do think there are other ways to get to the question of how do we provide better housing assistance and resources if that's what the council wants to do? The right to counsel is going to be very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The 250,000. We have a position of reconciliation that doesn't quite do that. It would do something different. I can turn it to Kelly to see are there other dollars within the reconciliation that can help? But if we're starting a new service, we're going to need some additional bodies, though.'",

We currently have funding set for the Office of Youth Development, Violence Prevention and Reentry Programing and then public health equity. Going forward, there are some additional funds set aside to be able to support additional investments under those three opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we also are hiring currently in the process of hiring with homeless services, funding a person to do to really focus on homeless services and housing. And the intent there was to really engage from an equity lens to be able to ensure that we are are ensuring that all of our services have an equity runs across.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homelessness and housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there are some funds available that we were looking to further invest into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Other reconciliation opportunities, but we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could make some of those funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Available for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The housing equity person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The intent of the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council. So I want to that say thank you. SALIBY So that said, you know, I think it's important. I think it is a racial equity issue. I mean, 70% of Latinos in the city of Long Beach are renters.'",
        "'speaker_1': '80% of black folks in Long Beach are renters. I think we have to think about this. I completely understand building out of division may take time. That's not something we can do here. But when the parameters of what we have, I want to make sure that those resources we have within the reconciliation dollars can be used to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'actually make sure we get started in that work. So I don't know that we even need to make a motion because you already have those funds dedicated within there. I just want to make sure that's reflected and that's that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now's the time to come back and handle that. The last thing I would say is I see there's a lot of interest in language access. I have more of a common sense question here. Every time we have we have council meetings, we have Spanish interpretation, and we know that there's always issues related to the quality of information'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I don't think that we should have to request Spanish interpretation. I know we don't get as many compliance. The bills should remain by request, but I think it might even be more cost effective to simply have Spanish interpretation available at every city council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want to have staff respond to that. If that agrees with this, then great. If not, I'd like to just make a motion that we figure out as a part of this how to make sure that Spanish interpretation is available, available at every city council meeting without without request, given the demand that we've seen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you speak to that, Mr. Martin?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I asked the city clerk to talk a little bit about the cost. Their office organizes the the translation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson. So we do have a cost estimate to provide Spanish translation services at every council meeting, and that estimated cost annually is $64,000. And that's having two translators for approximately 4 to 5 hours at every council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can do this through an outside vendor. It might be another option to look at hiring a full time translator for the city. And that's something we haven't costed out yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think we should figure I think we should figure that out. So. Mr.. Mr.. Chair, is that just making sense to you? Do you want this as a motion or this is city staffer receiving this other sentiment?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I must say that. Can you repeat what you are proposing here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean. What it is, is there's every council meeting we've had, there's been Spanish interpretation. I just don't know why we are still going through the process of requesting it when we know we get a different person every time and the quality is not great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we should be thinking about making sure we should still do by request our compliance. We don't have the same demand on Spanish. It happens every council meeting. Why are we still going through requesting it for council meeting?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It should be standard. And so I think that's a more realistic commitment that we should make the language access instead of nickel and diming it here and there. So I don't I want to figure out, you know, what's the best way to go about this need to be in a motion or can staff make this happen?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think that with all due respect, Councilman, I think staff has heard this, and I think it's the will of the council to improve our language, access on whether or not requesting or where we are with the process to me is a more of an administrative issue and less of a budget matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I would I would, you know, use the direction that you are providing, listen to your concerns, the concerns of others that have been relayed throughout not only this budget process, but but in other forums as well throughout the past couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do believe it's important that that we provide interpretation. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've got no pages. Yeah. And I was actually talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we have an open mic. Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I might.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just. I get where you're going. Councilman Tom. Mr. Modica, after receiving very. You put the network putting down.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So I understand that language access. We'll take a look at what we can do and whether we can do different models. And we were planning on using some of the money that was put aside for language access to invest in this area because the clerk does not have full staffing and money to do the level of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'translation that we're currently providing. So, yes, we'll look at that. I would say, though, I would request, if you're looking at adding a position as part of the $1.5 million, that that be part of the motion. So that is a substantive budget that that be considered as part of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's fine. So I'll make sure those are reflected in and my friendly to Councilman Austin the comments about how to treat the 1.5 to make sure rental housing position is reflected within that budget neutral and to also give direction to staff to figure out a way to make sure that Spanish is Spanish is not by request.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There may be a number of ways to get there. It doesn't have to be a position, but that staff that staff knows council meetings will have Spanish interpretation available, not necessarily by request.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Next up, we have Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I would like to share my congratulations to the Budget Oversight Committee and specifically Chair Austin in the great work that he's done over the last several months. It's a daunting process and he did it with Grace and I appreciate him and the work that he's doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also want to thank the city staff. I know how much work goes into the budget and all the questions all of us have behind the scene and how excellent you have been in providing additional resources and discussions for us to have something that was started as a discussion on the EEOC a few years ago, and I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'brought it up during the budget hearings last week. Again, is that our fleet fund is often looking for maintenance reductions and that a lot of our investments go to help reduce the maintenance costs of our fleet. And one of the ways that we can do that is actually by repairing our streets, our streets, our what are causing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our fleet to have so many bumps and bruises. And those bumps and bruises and additional insurance costs are not just burdened by the city, but they're also burdened by residents. So I'd like to propose a friendly that I know to be nothing new to members of this committee and this council, because we've talked about it before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'd like to see us redirect 70% of the general fund department capital contribution. That's a fraction of the 45 million in revenue a year that goes into that fund. It's literally only the general fund capital contribution to the Fleet Fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd like to redirect it to a street and alley fund focused on the worst streets and sidewalks and serve the worst streets and alleys in the city. Percentages approved in a previous motion I made several years ago where you take what the worst street data is and then distribute the which streets will get usage based on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the worst 80% of streets and 20% to alleys. Is that something that you would consider? Mr. Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, first I would ask the city manager, is that is that feasible and doable? And then secondly, would you be opposed to divide by nine in that regard?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So on the divide by nine, typically we have funds that are already divided by nine. And the challenge with that is there are certain districts, Councilmember Muranga is one of them, where when we started on the council together into District one and District two had $10,010 million in street repair need where Councilmember Odinga had $20 million in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'street repair need. And so until we the contributions in the district have the worst streets and alleys, we won't be able to. Furthermore, we did the alley money based on dirt alleys alone. And so we really need to focus on our worst allies next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A divide by nine would put some alleys at the top of the list in districts that their alleys are. Beautiful and amazing compared to what some of the other districts are experiencing. So it's not a lot of money, so it won't go super far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I do believe it's a good step in the right direction. And you'll notice that every council member received a email of support from or construction trades and they would like to get back to work as well. And this is just a small investment both in the economy and in the needs of our residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have committed to our residents that we will repair these streets and we consistently do our best to catch up. But as fast as we are cutting up, more are deteriorating, which is why the based on need is the most important component of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We continue to provide money divided by nine even though the public works director. It stated that he made a mistake in the next revision to the three year plan, that it should have been by need only so that districts could catch up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it was once again done with the divide by two in percentage. So I would ask that this specifically go towards the worst streets. And I think that it's kind of a blind roulette for us because I don't think any of us know what those next worst streets, the worst alleys will be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think that we all know that it would be a good investment. I think the second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I will I will let the city manager respond to that. And I'm I'm I'm open to to accepting your friendly to do that because I do recognize the importance of infrastructure repairs in my district and in every district in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know that there's tremendous need for street repairs and alley repairs throughout our city. And, you know, I'd be interested to find out if there are other districts that feel like they don't need it. And so the the divide by nine recommendation or thought was was one to, you know, be be more equitable for for everyone in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the city, for all of our residents. But I'll turn it over to the city manager to to address the the feasibility of making that happen in this budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And so I will start with infrastructure. It is it is absolutely a fact that our infrastructure does need additional funding. We do have a fair amount of money going to streets this year, actually a little bit more than we do even last year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe it's almost $40 million. I would point out that, you know, we do have some also concerns with sidewalks where we are under litigation to basically meet certain deadlines related to our ADA sidewalk compliance. That said, I'll talk a little bit about the fleet idea.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is a technically feasible idea. We do pay money from the general fund into the Fleet Fund to basically get caught up with our fleet capital replacement. Our fleet has done an amazing job and are under a manager of getting the fleet replacement cycles down from in the past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They'd been in the ten and 15 years down into the into the 5 to 7 year time frame, which saves us maintenance. So this is something you're able to technically do as it's proposed? I do I do want to caution us that this doesn't come without a cost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would increase our replacement cycles are most of these are PD cruisers. So our PD cruisers are currently at about a five year funding cycle. They're actually at six years because we didn't fund it last year. This would take us to somewhere between 6 to 7 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so with breakdowns and maintenance costs that there will be an impact. So it is a politics policy choice that does come with some ramifications to our fleet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Why don't we come to my office and I know you're considering accepting our friendly. Did you want to? Councilman? WOMAN Margot, do you have any additional other comments?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think that the representation that a majority of them would be PD cruisers is not fair. I only 70% of the fund would be a move. That means 30% of the fund would still be there. And currently approximately 40% of the fund is for Haiti.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cruise or so. It really is management's choice on which department they would have hit the hardest, and I would hope that they would use a strategy and model that would replace the vehicles that were most in need first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that vehicles when maintained well, I drive a 26 vehicle with 250,000 miles and it never gives me any problems. I make it every day go and I rarely have any repairs. I think that my mom drives a 1996 vehicle with 100,000 miles on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that's not the same as a 24 hour day, seven days a week vehicle, but not all of our vehicles are 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and looking into some of the vehicles that are a replacement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that it's a prudent decision at this time when when you look at how small the $40 million street repair budget gets us and it's great. It does a lot, but it doesn't attack what we at council said a year ago, which is getting rid of the worst streets in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We talked about the ten worst streets and the ten worst alleys. We were on national news about our streets and that street has still not been repaired along with others across this district, across the city. And I think that we really need to make that investment for our residents to making those changes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is a small amount of money. It's a one year. It's not a multiyear request. And that one year request would go very far. If you think about how many streets it could repair and how many alleys it could repair, and you average of 40 houses per street, which is a very low estimate you're talking about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'thousands of households would have a higher quality of life because the street outside of their house was repaired because of this kind of motion. And this was something that we all were working on together. And I know that it's difficult when we have a lack of continuity, when we lose a public works director.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think that it's important that we focus on a two part strategy, one that repairs our streets that's really of utmost importance to our residents. And to that focus is on getting our trades back to work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you for that. Councilmember Austin, I think you have that friendly to consider. And do I move on or do you want to respond?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am open to the friendly arm, but I'd like to hear from other council members to comment on this as well. And I think, again, the the the eyes wide open again, it's just whether or not it's worth streets or divide by nine.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We need to figure out how that should be allocated and directed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. And I think I just want to make sure, Councilman Alston and maybe, maybe Miss Yoon, are you also kind of keeping keeping notes on all of the kind of front and Lee requests that the council is making for for Chair Austin so we can kind of review those at the end of the motion or maybe'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the city attorney doing that. Okay. Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Well, I mean, keep going. Councilman, Mango, anything else?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For their. Yes. I want to thank Mr. Austin and the mayor for their recommendations related to our Parks Department and our youth sports programs. I thought those were impeccable. I appreciate the committee's decision to spare our K-9 dog officer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that was really important as well, along with our our violent sexual assault crime unit. I think that that's critical. I wish we could have kept an additional or to a sworn. And by merging it with a couple of other units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I hope that over the next year that PD can come back to us with any other savings that they can find throughout the year with this reduction in the number of sworn positions department wide. I know they'll realize other additional savings that they were counting on, including utilities, gas equipment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I hope that those savings can come back to us in a way that could either potentially reorg the air ops unit. As one of the callers said, perhaps instead of civilian izing, it just cut it in half or put a detective into that detail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because if we don't have the detectives out there doing the work, we're not going to have the great outcomes like we had today, where we solve crimes, where individuals with that horrible gang murdered on Halloween night. And so we just really appreciate our detectives and the work that they're doing to make sure that those gangs are on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'held accountable to the families that are mourning. So, again, thank you to all of that. I have one last recommendation, which is actually a part of item 26. And this council asked the city attorney to come forward with a recommendation on how we could participate in the 10% pay cuts early or at Bossi today, I heard members'",
        "'speaker_3': 'discussing in the community concerts, discussing library hours, things that are of importance to each of us. And I know we talked about donating back 10% of our salaries to stand in in support of the citywide furlough program. And I am 100% committed to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I would also make a recommendation to is that if a councilmember chose to donate that back into the city, that's great and it could go to the general fund. I don't know what it would be allocated toward since they're it's not a part of this budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if that councilmember would prefer to make a exact same sized donation to the Library Foundation or the partners of Parks, then that money could be committed back to the city through other programs that would really help and support our parks and library budgets, which are being really hit during this time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that would be something that I'll be making a recommendation on a number 26. But I really think you guys did an excellent job. Thank you for all of your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up is Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, BMC. Thank you, city staff. I really believe that this budget is not only the most difficult budget that we've had to pass, it also provides a lot of opportunity and a lot of room for growth for those that need it most.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that that's what we've heard from our community members through this process. And so I appreciate the comments made by the previous council members. I wanted to ask staff on the right to council what is the quickest timeline that we can expect something on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know you mentioned that we might have to go to an RFP and I know that the last time we did something like this, it was new and it just took a really long time to get out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't think we have an estimated timeline right now. We're talking about steps to make it go a little faster than a typical procurement process. We understand the urgency. I think understanding if there is a scope of work already written by the county that we agree with and meets the council's needs, that cuts a significant time'",
        "'speaker_6': 'off. And then if we can use their vendor list and open up an RFP quickly to that vendor list, things can go a lot quicker. So the funds will be available on October one. We would start and then put a process in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Certainly before the end of the year we would be allocating money, hopefully even sooner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. I was going to ask the chair of the see if there was openness to try to put a 90 day, if it hasn't been scoped out in 90 days to have a report back to council. Does that seem like a time period that I even need to make a motion on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that you guys can probably.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Guess. I would ask the city manager, is this something that he can work with?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think that is the target that we would look to do is 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Beautiful. Thank you so much. On the rental housing division that Councilmember Richardson brought up, it's something I definitely wholeheartedly support. I think that there's a couple opportunities in the budget and I just want to say I think this a Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, Mike. She got teary. Okay. I think that there are a couple opportunities in the budget for just reorganization and that this is definitely one of the areas that we've got staff in different departments that are working on these programs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I appreciate the motion or the conversation that's been had around this. I look forward to seeing what staff develops in full fully support that. The one area the other area I also support the language access conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do know that before the last big budget cuts that the city had under Bob Foster, that people didn't have to request translation. It was just a given. And it wasn't just for the council meetings, it was for the council meetings for any chartered commission meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think the commitment that this council continues to make every year, if there's a way to figure out how we can make sure we have somebody and hopefully the same person every week, I know that we've heard many different translators and that sometimes they're not saying exactly what the community members are saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we know that it continues to be a challenge. So whatever we can do to get to that I think would be wonderful. On the most the emotion that's already been included around looking at new models. I think it would be very helpful, as I mentioned earlier, if we're working, especially if we've got six months to kind'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of put together this new community model, working with our community partners, not only those that have come out and supported this, like the community organizations that spoke tonight, or Nathaniel Brown, who's done an op ed on it, but also including mental health organizations, suicide prevention team and trauma informed partners to ensure that we're being thoughtful and thinking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'outside of the box on how we can provide services for those that are most impacted. And so the only thing that I have that really is, in addition to what community members have already spoke to, is I'm wondering, staff, if you guys could provide a list of organizations to the City Council for organizations that we pay membership'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that exceed $3,000 a year to the Council for review at a later date. Is that something that that would be possible? I don't think it's going to be that many.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Modica, can you do what you counsel on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If that's something that you want to include in the budget direction, we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Just to to from for that that has the membership, the cost and where the fund comes from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I suggest that the amount be a little bit higher than that? That could be hundreds. You know, you might have individual memberships for individual employees. I think you're looking at organizations like Organizations of the city belongs to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. That we pay annually. So not like a one time fund, but something that we're annually paying membership fees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you're not if I can ask for an exclusion for like, you know, certain professional fees might be paid for if you go to a, you know, if you get a certification or something. So I'd like us to focus on the organizations for like the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's your intent. Is that is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're going to go for the full city. Yeah. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Okay. I think those are my I, I think that, you know, I really applaud the mayor. The budget that was presented to us was a great step in the right direction, including everything from climate work to work on housing and also our small'",
        "'speaker_3': 'business support. So I think we're in a a good place considering where we thought we might be. So I look forward to the continued work on our police reform, on our community organizations, our housing models, and making sure that that work is not something that's one in one night.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not something that's achieved in one day, but really is a culture shift for the city and recognizing that it is hard and uncomfortable and that's okay. But I feel good about where we're at tonight, so thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Council member. Council. Council member. During the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank all the commentary has come forward so far. I think it's a great conversation and some real good suggestions and good ideas out there as well. And I want to thank you for joining me to the B or C.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a quite a an experience, my first time ever being in that in that committee. And it was quite a quite a learning process. Obviously, it was a very difficult budget this year with COVID 19 and the downturn in the economy and all the other obstacles and challenges that we face.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This budget is one that can we can build, could be good. We could not proud, but we can we can look at it as being one that that meets what we need to have worked for this year. In regards to my participation in it, it was eye opening in regards to where we're at and where we need'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be. There's most of the things that I'm really pleased with is that we're really looking at institutionalizing some of those money that I think are very important for us to do, such as those that are going to be with the Office of Equity, the movement of some of the programs into the city manager's office and making'",
        "'speaker_1': 'them structural. There are some friendlies that are here at this budget right now that we're hearing that I am certainly in favor of. I want to thank customer Richard. So for bringing forward the Spanish translation issue to the forefront.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's something that, again, that I think it should be institutionalized and should be present at all of it. It is something that is very important and that we've seen during this process that there is a lot of interest out there from Spanish speakers to participate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we are in the political process and it's very important that we provide this kind of service to them as well and making sure that everybody's voice is heard. I also want to encourage the staff to look at the possibility of a full time staff person to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not it's not easy. Translating translation services is a very difficult thing to do and learn. And it's it's one that requires a very special skill that is not easily required and requires a lot of work get into it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And obviously, as we've heard, not all translation services are are the best, but they certainly try to give credit for it for making that effort. There's the other friendly that that I heard and they want to support is the friendly put together by councilmember Mongo in regards to streets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She's absolutely correct. And when I look at my street in the seventh District that we had some of the worst out there and they've been that way for a long time. And so the damage done to vehicles, both both personal and city, are tremendous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's because we are we defer maintenance of the streets to another year in the year. And as we continue to do so, they deteriorate even more. So we do have some bad streets. And I would look at it, I respect they were streets first because that's where the damage is being created.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, there is a concern about 70% of the budget being moved towards that. I would be I would leave that up to the two staff to work that out in regards it doesn't need to be 70% to deal with the worst streets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's something that they would have to pencil out. And also in regards to the continuing efforts of riot of re instituting the re lifeguard program and with the EMS. So certainly very supportive of that. And and I'm hoping that we can make that can help that continue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One last thing is that there was another motion apparently with that councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews for 4.5%. And the two days in the cannabis issue, there's something there that I think we really do need to look at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know Councilmember Austin carousel we'll see was concerned about that $400 $400,000 difference that it would create if we were to hold off on 2.5% tax increase to study it further. And I think it would behoove us to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we should give the industry an opportunity to look at their possibilities of what the difference will make in being open an additional 2 hours, as opposed to what was the recommendation of one additional hour or so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we need to look at that seriously. And and nobody likes taxes. Nobody likes to increase taxes. I certainly don't. But, you know, if it's going to help us balance our budget, so be it. However, let's do it because we need to and not because we think that we have to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, it was quite an experience working on the BRC. I want to thank member also for leadership of the DLC and of course my colleague on their up to the price of your customer price for also being a member of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I've learned quite a bit this year on what's going on and they are hoping that we can learn about the budget tonight and let's get this behind us and move forward with the city and advancing, really making the city of Lomita great city that it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customary Ringo. Next up is council member Zendejas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you very much to our Budget Oversight Committee chair Austin. For all the hard work that you put in on the budget and all the great recommendations as well as from the mayor and the and our city staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. I do have a couple questions for you, but I also wanted to say thank you to Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For talking about, you know, the need for our Spanish speaking translations and needed on a on a every every week basis, at least for City Hall. I think that's very important. And I also at the same note, I also wanted to thank our city staff, Tom and Becky, who have been continuously working with me on the translation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'portion. And we've been working on it for weeks and we continue to work at it. We have also realized that one of the hardest things to do, while we're not seeing each.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Other, we're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Face to face, is that when somebody was translating and they're right next to you, they can easily tap on your shoulder and ask you to stop speaking so that they can translate for you. So we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Found that that's a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Problem. And I know that thanks to Tom and Becky for both working with me and trying to address those issues and smooth that out a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Little bit more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I thank you for that. I also wanted to ask the city staff, I, I said, as you know, I seconded the motion for Vice Mayor Andrews. And I want you to know, with those 2 hours that we that we are expanding for the cannabis industry, our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that a way to offset the 4000 that is needed, 400,000 that it's needed?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the the original proposal was a 1% tax, which generated over $800,000. The revised back proposal is a half cent tax, so cutting it in half and then trying to make up the rest of the dollars through the the two hour extension going up to 11 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Grace, can you tell us the value of that of those two together?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So the BBC has already recommended going to half a percent and then the extension of the 2 hours. And so from the original proposed budget of generating 800,000 in revenue, the Bossi recommendation generates 600 an estimated 600,000 of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it was a hit to revenues of 200,000, which is in the current proposal, balanced out from that point. If we saw the 2 hours extension, it's already included in the number and included in the BBC recommendations that are all accounted for in terms of usage and sources.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we go back down and don't increase any of the tax at all, so we don't increase the 0.5%, an additional 400,000 would need to be identified.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for explaining that, Ms.. Hoon. I also wanted to say thank you very much for all everyone that has been able to participate in this conversation. I know that everyone before me has said some great stuff about the budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am. This is my first time, so I was pretty excited to go through this process and I know it has been hard work, but I'm really glad that we are coming to to this point and that we're considering everybody's input.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's very important. Another question that I had is. In regards to work Councilmember Mango said regarding the of the helicopter is it is that and this is probably.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This question is probably for a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fire chief. Would that purchase affect any of our engines and fire engines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it's been a. We'll answer that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Chief. And as he is coming to to the mike, I also wanted to know if one if that purchase would affect our fire engines and also would it affect the Carl Moyer grant that is pending to receive?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for the question. As far as the actual purchase, are you talking about the 1.9 that we're giving back or what purchase are you talking about exactly?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The one for the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Helicopter that we were talking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the motion that our friendly that counsel Mango had had said earlier. And so it's curious, the ending of that purchase was going to be affecting any of our engines. Fire engines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. That wouldn't impact fire in any way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, came. Thank you. Thank you, Chief, for addressing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember. Our next topic, Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I'd also like to commend our committee chair, Austin Vice-Chair Price and member Turanga for just a fantastic job, in particular for Chair Austin. First time out, just really hit it out of the park. So congratulations on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to follow up on Councilor Mungo's friendly on repairing the worst the worst streets. That really got my attention. And I think at least one of those streets goes from the fourth District to the fifth District. So we would certainly share in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my question is for fire in particular, just because I've been studying it and the grants available to fire. And I think Mary's and somebody touched on it. But so we have a Carl Moyer grant for I believe it's for the purchase of new engine companies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What if we delayed or canceled an order on one of those engine companies? Would we potentially lose that grant money? Is Councilman Supernova. To my understanding, there is a time limit on that grant and I would have financial management speak to that more closely, but I believe it's an 18 month performance period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is Sandra. And yes, we are at the end of the time period for the Grand Prix delayed any of the vehicles and those vehicles we delayed, we would lose. So would there be a possibility to make an exception for the apparatus, those bigger apparatus?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would that be for this friendly amendment if if it's going to cost us money to delay this? Obviously, we wouldn't want to do that. Also, I think if the chief could maybe speak to just maintenance in general. Is there anything you can tell us on the maintenance cost of of older apparatus?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's there's got to be a break even point to where you're better off to buy new. If there's anything you can enlighten us about on that, I'd appreciate it. The issue with having the older apparatus is that the the equipment becomes outdated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It becomes more difficult to get the repairs taken care of. It becomes more difficult to locate the the actual parts and equipment. And the repairs seem to be coming up quite a bit more often. So at a certain point, it is more cost effective to replace rather than repair.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember. This is Tom. If I can provide a little bit of clarity, because this is a complex area. The the fire fleet purchases are on the agenda tonight. And they would be separate from any budget discussion you're talking about because of the size of the fleet purchases and our fiscal difficulties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the past, we hadn't been able to fully fund the fleet capital replacement for our pumpers. And so what you have in front of you tonight is both a committee grant, that's item number 17, and number 18 is the lease purchase of two fire ladder trucks and ten fire pumpers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be one action. The motion on the floor, the friendly being considered is for our other vehicles, which is about 63% of our vehicles are our police type vehicles. Those would be we have about 800 and and we get the number 823 vehicles that we fund through the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So about 62 and a half percent are police. And then the others are things like sweepers and code enforcement and and our public works vehicles, those types of things. So that is would be what you were delaying and extending the fleet replacement by a year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So thank you, Mr. City Manager. So what you're saying is the friendly here stands alone to address those issues and the new at the purchase of the new fire apparatus is a separate item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. That's all I have. Okay. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I do have a question regarding the recommendation that was made by Councilwoman Mongeau.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Infrastructure. And I think it's important to clarify this for the public. So I know that our. Sales tax measure. Had a capital improvement project that identified the projects that would be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Focused the focus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of that measure money for a period of time. If we were to adopt a Worst Streets program, how would that impact the infrastructure plan that we've already put out and advertise to the community as the streets they can look forward to having repaired in the coming years?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll take a first crack at that and turn it over to Eric if I missed anything. So if you're adding new money, it should not affect the map that has been put out already. We could always use more money to complete everything that's on the map and accelerate it, but you could add new projects and new'",
        "'speaker_6': 'dollars. The worst Streets approach would be a little bit different than the pavement management plan that we funded. We tend to look at how much money, what is the need for replacement and typically the worst streets cost the most to repair, which is why they're in the worst condition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that is certainly a direction we can take it. Would we have not been able to focus money on the worst streets? We've been basically using the pavement management plan to inform street decisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate Mr. Motorcars clarification on my friendly. I think that I often forget that I talk in budget speak and that when we outlined the general fund capital improvement and sorry capital purchase budget that the leases and other things would would be exempt from that because those are different strategies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just also wanted to add in 2018, we as a council made a commitment to focus infrastructure money on the streets that were the worst. And unfortunately, our public works director at the time did not take our direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And at that time that the specific motion was that on a go forward basis, the city shall make citywide investments in streets, alleys and sidewalks based on need. And we did that. We made millions of dollars of investments in the worst alleys in the city, but we didn't follow through with that on the streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And like Councilman Price said, it would not impact anything we've promised to the community thus far. It's new money and I think moving the black eyes of our city. And we all saw what a huge impact it was to remove all the dirt alleys, to remove the next worst alleys and the next worst streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of those streets span multiple districts. And so you're really getting a huge investment. I'm also, to Mr. Frangos point, an alley in the seventh District may cost more than an alley in the ninth district, and that's because of the composition of the alley and what they were made of at the era in which the alley investments'",
        "'speaker_3': 'were made. And so we as a council discussed that policy. And and so this is nothing new. And I hope that Councilmember Austin will consider adopting it, having heard so much support from my colleagues. And furthermore, I just want to say once again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a lot of priorities here and a lot of things that we've come together on. And I'm really proud to be a member of this council and the great impacts that we're able to make this year. So congratulations to everyone should this pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Real quick, I have a question for city staff just on the standards. Whenever we replace our fleet, disregarding our fire fleet, do we have any standards for what cars were purchasing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, we absolutely do. So one of the things that we do when we buy new vehicles is we always look first to see if we can use an EV vehicle. So every replacement actually helps us with our climate goals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'John Groce can give us more information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we are just about to buy 50 hybrids for the police department everywhere and replace them when it becomes available. And I will not only blame the police, but we reduce our maintenance costs and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. I can't hear you any more. But that was the perfect answer. My my second question is for the materials. I recall talking about the new road material and there being option to use rubber and recycled tires. And I'm wondering if that's a standard that we that we have right now to use for green.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Street repair products.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Eric Lopez, if you can address that, please. Eric, can you hear us? We'll try to get the answer to that question, Councilmember. So I do know that we do use recycled content. Just not sure exactly how much and what product.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we do wherever we can, try to use some of the tires and put back into our asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman's in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fair. I also wanted to comment on Stacey Mungo's council member Mungo's comment earlier in regards to the street and the alleys and being from a district who has one of the I want to say very, very bad streets and very bad alleys, not only because we're in downtown, but because of the usage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I remember that when I got elected, I said, you know, one of the first things that I want to work on is on fixing our streets. And then I realized, you know, the whole process that it takes to do that and how long the wait is for it to be able to fix certain streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I am extremely supportive of being able to fix the streets in a most need basis. And I think that that that's a really good move for us to go into. Another question that I had, again, maybe mishear and you can help me with this again, I'm back into that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going back into the cannabis tax and the 2 hours of operation that are behind those 2 hours of operation be bringing in, in addition to ours, to what they're doing right now to the city. So we also have a jay here who can linger on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'll jump in first to say that, you know, the additional hours of operations could potentially generate more sales.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not clear right now or the extension of the hours if they will generate the same average amount of sales that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'An hour a day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An hour of open hours right now. And there is some data that shows that at different points of the day, there are different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Levels of sales. So just extending hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of operation doesn't automatically mean the same level of average sales. However it is, there is an assumption that extending the hours will generate some additional sales. We're just not quite sure exactly if it's at the same pace.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So at the moment, we're projecting for each hour.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the 2 hours that the boss has recommended, for each hour, a 100,000 of sales being generated. That answer your question, councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. You know, and one of the things that I was looking at here in my notes is that, you know, previously we were looking at extending that just one hour, which would mean more or less that it would probably generate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And like you said, we're not certain, but we were projecting that it would bring in $1.6 million more. And so I'm thinking, you know, with the 2 hours, it would probably double that that amount. And so I was thinking that it would be a really good, you know, starting point for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But with going ahead and and asking for for us to delay this and bring a study forward, I think would be the best thing to do, only because that way right now we have uncertainties and that we may be able to have more data in our hands to be able to move forward on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you. Thank you for that. No problem. And Councilman, I just want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While it is still an estimate and an assumption at this point, until we get data each hour of additional hours, we are projecting.'",
        "'speaker_5': '100,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes council comment on this item going back to Councilmember Austin. So, Councilman, we have your motion and second by councilman, which was to adopt these recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. And then also in the elements. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to. So not amused, councilman. And so and then we also have out there were some friendlies or requests that were also made to that. And so I don't know if you and you want to go through those and then find out what what Councilman Austin's decision on on taking those in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure we can do that. So now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I may need some additional clarifications is a motion or a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Friendly to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Continue to extend the business hours for cannabis businesses by 2 hours per the Bossi recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To increase cannabis business license tax until an economic impact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Study can be conducted and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Evaluated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was a friendly by Councilmember Andrews, and the comment here was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we still need to find if this friendly work is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excepted, we still need to find an additional 400,000 if we wanted to offset it within.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The item itself.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we have a council member state.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This motion to use 70%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the general fund contributions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For Fleet Capital and F 21 to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fund street and alleys based on the worst streets and alleys. With 80% going to streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And 20% going.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To alleys. And that's the note.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That we have here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The third from Councilwoman Pierce to request city manager to report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Back to city council in a memo on any city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Annual membership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fees for organizations that exceed.'",
        "'speaker_2': '$11 or worse. And I believe that's all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The what officially requested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be. Is there any clarification on those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Items.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That each of the councilmember want to correct or decrease?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'GRACE This is Tom. I'd like for the record, I think we had two from Councilmember Richardson. One was to do an exploration about housing possession and using some of the reconciliation dollars for creating a position that could help coordinate housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And also, the council, just so we captured in the motion to make language access available at council meetings upon request or not upon request, and for staff to look at different motion or ways to fund language access or provide language access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the only one that I have down from that list was just two for four back from staff to the Council on memberships and information back. So I have that written down here also as just I'm not sure if that's part of the motion, but certainly part of the requests of what's coming out of the out'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the discussions. Let me go to go back to Councilman Austin. We can take those individual want. So why don't we why don't we go take this council?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. So, Mr. Mayor, and to more council colleagues, I want to thank you all for your your very thoughtful input and suggestions, the the friendly amendments as well. I'll take them from the top. The one that is glaring is the the the cannabis tax, retail tax.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I've heard from enough council colleagues to understand that there's some unsteadiness to move forward with that. But there is except there is a everybody seems to be okay with extending the hours and and studying that. I would ask and I would accept this amendment, but I would ask that this issue come back at midyear for review'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And and we would we should have some some data and a better idea as to how this is working at that time. Again, this is a budget that is an unconventional this we have have not faced these type of challenges in many, many years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I would I think we need to have some flexibility to to to look at this. And I would just say that to the the cannabis industry out there, they are doing pretty, pretty well and are exceeding our expectations in terms of generating revenue here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are asking a lot are several of our departments all close to 5000 employees. Everybody is taking sacrifices and in impacts as a result of this budget. And I think we need to come together. And so with that, I would accept the friendly amendment with the condition that we come back to review the the tax at midyear'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Secondly, in terms of Councilmember Richardson's recommendations, understanding that there is some money in the the reconciliation process. Housing is an important issue. I'm open to accepting that, as well as the recommendation or amendment friendly amendment for language access.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then as it relates to the Fleet Front Fund, I do understand that there's this is a this is a bold move. We as a city council have made a lot of major commitments to our residents, and we have a lot of needs in terms of residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so to councilman goes a friendly amendment. I do support that and I am making note of seems to be there needs to be seems to be some consensus around we're streets but I do understand that there is a measure a plan already in this should supplement and be on top of whatever that measure a plan is'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And so I do not think one year is going to to hurt our fleet operations drastically. And I certainly hope not. And so I'm willing to accept these amendments and move forward with the vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendments then are accepted and then we will we do have a motion any second. So let's go ahead and do a roll call vote.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Mayor, can we get a little bit of clarity on just the I heard use the measure a plan to to fund streets if we can get a little more clarity on that just so we're.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know we already have a measure, a plan for for residential streets. This makes the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clarity. The clarity, I think, is that this is not going to affect our measured rate plan that measure moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is on top.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On top.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So you would be adding streets on top of this. Are you still adding the worst streets or are you using a different method methodology to to add in? Or is it divide by nine? I'm sorry, we just need that clarification.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So that's the difference. That's the 5 to 6% in Councilman Austin's motion. This is a separate request. This is the one that we talked about in closed session several weeks ago about us wanting to stand in salary. Our colleagues are our staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In alignment with the furlough.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So. So we get furloughs to help make up the city's budget deficit. So is the budget not in a position where it needs our money? That is not the case here. I want to hear from staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the intent is that this money does go back to help out. Part of that $11 million goal that is that through part of our $30 million in solutions in the budget you just passed. So it is a small amount because this is, you know, just a couple of of of employees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the idea is that it would go back into the general fund to basically help with the solutions. I think we can work as long as we're able to work with those foundations to, you know, offset certain expenses that they can go to a nonprofit who then gives us a commiserate savings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can still balance that, if that's a small amount. If it's going to grow into a bigger program, then we would have a budget that would be out of balance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So so that said, I think I'll figure out the details later. But if there's if we're making sure it goes to nonprofits, make sure lobby center for Economic Inclusion part of it. I want to make sure we can support something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think as long as they are doing a service that we would offset, as, you know, you know, not provide certain city dollars to that, that then they would pick up and said, then we could make that work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because that is a nonprofit that works with, you know, city, you know, city purposes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Why don't we just put a blanket of nonprofit? Just put the definition so we can figure out what the organizations are. Nonprofits that help conduct city service as a blanket definition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll continue to hear from my colleague. This was supposed to be a pretty simple. We all agree that parks and libraries are two things that really help in our work towards equity and all the things in our city that are in major need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've all talked about wanting to support those two things and Councilmember Granger wanted to add one additional group. I don't want to add nine groups. That's not the point. The point was to give an additional option. All councilmembers are still able to just give the money back to the city.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilman Super, for that clarification. I have the same request for clarification, so I'm glad that was answered. I appreciate what this item is attempting to do and I support this item and I will be voting in favor of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a personal choice. I like that. It's the current wording of the item requires a connection to a city service that might have been impacted as a result of our budget shortfall that we'll be able to replenish towards these funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For me personally, the money that I will be giving back will go my preferences for it to go back to the city to help fill that that shortfall. To the small extent that it is helping, but I think it should be really the city manager who determines where that money should go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's just my personal choice. But I do appreciate trying to keep it limited so that the money is directly going back into services that the city would have to otherwise provide that might be getting picked up by foundation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I very much appreciate the spirit of the motion and I want to thank Councilman Mongo for bringing up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. I think the questions that were asked clarify for me I did have questions about that was voluntary and each council member or elected official was able to put those funds towards the organization as laid out in this motion, recognizing that all of our staff is taking this furlough, including our city manager, recognizing the council is stepping'",
        "'speaker_3': 'up and doing something they don't have to do, but also that the intent was to fill that that gap. So I. I support the item because it's it's flexible enough, but it feels to me like a little bit more of a divide by nine fund where you're able to identify where you want to spend your resources within'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city versus filling the gap. So I just want to be clear that it's filling some gap that the city is not able to provide because of the budget cuts. So with that, I think you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customers and there has.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And on that note, you know, just echoing with my colleagues have said so far, I think it's important that we as elected officials also do our part and get it back. But I also think that it needs to go directly to, yes, the city to fill in the gaps where this budget is not going to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'be able to provide some of the services. So I in my mind, it would make more sense to just, you know, allocate those that money. However, the council district decides is a priority in their district, seeing that all of us have very different priorities, but at the same time we overlap on a lot of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm I'm confident that city staff will be able to navigate that and actually put those funds where it's most needed right now. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have Councilman Richardson and then Councilman Austin, and then we're going to go and go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks a lot. So we'll discuss this in closed session, I think. For me, this is about showing solidarity with the workers that we are contributing to the city's deficit. We're also going to participate in the furlough. For me, it wasn't about cherry picking nonprofits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It wasn't about, you know, you know, being too creative about it. It was showing solidarity. I think the message here, I guess, diluted here and regular city employees don't get an opportunity to pick which charity or which nonprofit they'd like to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Secondly, I'm just concerned about the message that it sends if services are being cut. Those are that's a difficult hit. And I'd suggest that it's okay for a nonprofit to pick up the service. I just don't like the way they're represented is represented.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Personally, I'd like to see where what you know, I'd like to see this go back to the fund. And, you know, if if Councilman Mongo doesn't agree, I'll make a motion here and we'll just vote on it. So I'll make a promise that I have subs through motion, that we all surrender the same amount, we do the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'same thing, and city manager determines how to utilize that to fill the budget. That's my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was a substitute. There's a second. To that substitute. Our councilman asked him.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. And I want to just say that that. I tend to agree with some of the colleagues. My comment to my colleagues regarding the intent of this particular agenda item that I believe was prepared by the city manager, city attorney at the council's recommendation when this issue was discussed, it was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That we want to participate in this. We think it's only right and fair if we are asking employees to participate in furloughs, that we take cuts ourselves. And that is where I'd like to to to to end this or to stay with the intent on this motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I will be voting in support of the motion as written. I hope we can stay there as much as possible and and make sure that we are consistent across the board. All nine council offices, but all elected offices in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman, I think that just to be clear, so that that's the that's what the substitute motion is, correct. Councilman Richardson, it's just the original motion, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. It's just simple, straightforward. And so far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was just seconding the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I want to stand in solidarity with our comrades. That was the point of this. I actually received comments and discussions from safety staff members who had asked for programing that we were not able to restore and restoring, and specifically only giving the money to partners or parks or to the Library Foundation, the two organizations that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'specifically fill the gaps that we leave. I feel is the best step in that direction. It is not the same as taking a cut that city staff take. I wish it was that easy. The the the challenge that councilmen are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Supermodel pointed out, is that it's still voluntary because the law is that we are paid a certain amount. And so I was trying to bring just an additional option to the table. I'm disappointed that. Quite frankly, I'm just disappointed that Councilmember Richardson has taken it in this direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, it seems as though on the last six weeks, any item that's brought forward and that's not someone that's on his team, he has to come up with reasons why it's not a good idea and why it's not prepared properly for council or any of these other things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I really just I'm not appreciative of the direction that this has gone. And it's it's quite disappointing. I'm going to ask Councilmember Odinga to stand with me in a substitute substitute motion and just limit the substitute substitute to just what I had originally asked, which was parks and libraries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any councilmember who does not support either parks or libraries or giving it back to the city fund. Vote no if you don't want to make your contribution. It's a few thousand dollars that we're all choosing to do and that we're making a commitment to stand with our colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And quite frankly, our park staff and our library staff will benefit, and so will the community. And if you choose, I completely respect Councilman Price's decision to still give back the money to the city. I would encourage her to think about the fact that she could donate even more money to a nonprofit, as she wouldn't have the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tax burden, the tax differential of paying tax on money she donated. So you could donate even more than the 10%. But I also didn't want to have 15 different groups so that councilmembers theoretically game the system and donate to something they've donated to in the past and not have to make an additional donation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm very committed to making the 10% or more contribution, and I'm committed to donating to both parks and libraries. But if if councilmembers don't feel that those are a. A worthy cause and they want to vote no on the substitute substitute motion or not stand with me and give me a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's fine. And I hope that our foundations and our parks, the library staff here hear the vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I don't. I don't have time for. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think. Customers of Mango made a direct appeal to me. You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you made a substitute for me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I need a second. And on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will second that. But let me let me make a clarification here. I thought that you got the economic. Partnership was a citywide program as well. That's why I supported that. Although there is a big focus on West Derby.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. But that it was a citywide program as well. So if I'm wrong, then I'm wrong. But that's why I also included that. I would go along with the library. In part, that's what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just to be clear, the constant refrain that you are, you are seconding the substitute. Substitute. Correct. Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You didn't hear it? Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You think we have a substitute? Substitute? And just to clarify what that is, will you repeat the substitute substitute, Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, Mayor. Members of the Council, we have three motions to substitute. Substitute? As mentioned as a motion by Councilmember Mungo, a second by Councilmember Urunga. And it is the motion as written with the additional option to donate the savings to either the Library Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or Partners in Park. No. Those are the only two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We'll take a roll call vote on that. I don't want to make sure we have any more. Many more queue up comes from Richardson. Is that a queue up or no?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. No, thanks.'",
