    "Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive a presentation on The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authoritys (Metro) Ballot Measure M: Traffic Improvement Plan, and its potential impact on Long Beach.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'October 14th, our newest Hall of Fame member, Councilmember Ella Alston. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you. So, Madam Clerk, we're going to go to item number 26. We're taking this out of order, but we have at 5:00 time certain.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you mind reading item number 26.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive a presentation on the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authorities ballot measure M traffic improvement plan and its potential impact on Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So we've allocated 30 minutes for the study session. It'll begin with a 10,000,010 minute staff report from Diana Tang, followed by Signal Hill Councilmember Larry Forester and Diane Hight from the Gateway Cities Council of Governments, who will be allotted 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then the then Stephanie Wiggins, deputy CEO of Metro, who will be a light at 5 minutes, then public comment. So we want to thank our guests, Councilman Forester, Miss Hite, Miss Wiggins, for joining us. We appreciate your time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's begin with the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor, for the staff report. You will hear from our government affairs manager, Diana Tang.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They are members of the City Council. Thank you for this opportunity to provide you with a general overview of Measure M, which is the Metro Board of Directors Sales Tax Measure to fund regional transportation initiatives. So we have for you a PowerPoint presentation tonight that should be coming up shortly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in this PowerPoint, we'll be going over just a quick introduction of of the ballot measure, which is an extension of Measure R, and it should be queuing up. As we speak here. Those of you I'm sure you all remember measure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our measure are has funded a number of street improvements in each of your districts. Local streets and roads has helped repave some some of the streets in your neighborhoods and is a vital source of funding for public works.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There we are measure. Measure M Centers, County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, sales tax measure. So here we go. I will do an introduction, as I said, a background to Measure R and then we'll go into the details of the current ballot measure that voters will be voting on in November.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Measure M proposes to increase the local sales tax in L.A. County by 1%. It also would extend Measure R, the existing half cent sales tax in L.A. County indefinitely. So both of these measures together will provide Metro with a $0.01 sales tax to fund regional transportation initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the ballot measure also includes an expenditure plan, which we will take a quick look at as well. Just to recap on Measure R in L.A. County, this ballot measure has funded a number of regional improvements, including the Expo Line, the Gold Line, the Regional Connector Project in downtown L.A. that connects Union Station with a number of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'different light rail lines throughout L.A. County. And then also improvements that you're seeing currently on the I-5 freeway are all Measure R projects. In Long Beach. As I've mentioned earlier, a number of streets in each of your districts have been paved using this type of revenue source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For example, Park Avenue from Pacific Coast Highway to Atherton eighth Street, from Freeman Avenue to Gladys Avenue. The list goes on and I'm sure there are a number that you know of in your district that are not enumerated on this slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So moving forward, Measure R does expire in 2039 and Metro has identified a number of regional needs that exist now. And without funding going into the future, there could potentially be a shortage of revenues to address some of the major infrastructure projects that would really benefit the region.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So as I mentioned before, Measure M includes an expenditure plan. It also projects that are included in Measure M were evaluated by Metro using a performance metric matrix that you see up there that places a pretty high value on using congestion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Nobody likes sitting in traffic on the freeways. And so it appears that that that is weighted at 45%. A number of other criteria that Metro has included in their performance matrix include safety, economic benefits, sustainability, all weighted at slightly less, but still in that performance matrix nonetheless.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what has been proposed in measure are a number of major projects, including the culvert, a tunnel valued at about $7 billion, the West Wing and a transit corridor project at about 2.5 million West Side, Purple and extension, Gold Line extension and the Crenshaw Line extension.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are all light rail extensions in L.A. County, in and around the region, but not in Long Beach. So what is in Long Beach? In Long Beach, a half cent sales tax, as you know, will likely generate about 24 million in in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And major projects that we will be eligible for in this funding source will fund improvements to Shoemaker Bridge as an early action I 710 project the Islip and ten Freeway later on in later years in the ballot measure a Wardlow grade separation as as you all know the Wardlow station off the blue line is one of a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'one of the worst stations that has been rated by Berkeley. And so safety improvements at that location do need to be made. Metro recognizes that, and we've had a number of conversations related to the where the grade separation project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Overall investments in blue line safety are also a part of the ballot measure. Safety on the blue line and other lines in in the ballot measure are all included as operations and maintenance and then potential light rail connecting the green line and the blue line in downtown Long Beach and that residents can get to L.A.X. This is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'also in there. One thing that we are looking forward to is a direct local return. The measure ballot measure proposes a 17% local return to all cities. Long Beach is expecting approximately 7 million annually from this revenue source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The 17% is an increase from the current 15% local return that we'd get from Measure R so and also based on population. So both of those items are in in Measure M and good for a Long Beach. And so similar to the type of local return revenues that we get currently for measure, our local return for Measure'",
        "'speaker_6': 'M could be used for streets and roads, active transportation projects, green streets that include stormwater complete streets, the bicycle boulevards that you see, public access to recreational facilities and then transit oriented communities as well. So just a quick look at the funding source or the funding revenues that we can expect you'll see there, measure our revenues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We get about 5.5 in local return annually and that's based on a 15% local return. Allow me to translate currently gets a 20% return as a transit operator in the region. If measure impasses we will get the city of Long Beach will get about 6.7 million or approximately 7 million based on a 17% local return.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in total, that's we're looking close to $12.2 million. And similar to in measure our measure M includes 20% return for me to transit the bringing their total to 8.2. And so before I conclude my presentation, the board of directors did vote to place this ballot measure on the November ballot in June, and voters will be voting'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on this November 8th. And with that, I'm available for questions if we don't go to presentations from the cog in Metro First.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Vice Mayor, if I can add to the presentation. Clearly, Mr.. Mr. Hang and Arturo Sanchez have been very, very involved in their staff, have been involved in working with Metro and looking at this measure and trying to make sure that if anything is put on the ballot that Long Beach's projects are are on the table and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that they're considered as part of the overall strategy. So I want to thank them for their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And so, Mr. Modica, Ms.. Tang, thank you for that presentation. We're going to move forward to the first of our of our guests tonight, which will be Signal Hill Council member Larry Forester and Diane Hight from the Gateway Cities card.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's queue up. Once again, I'll just remind folks, we, you know, we have a certain amount of time allocated here. So we're going to set up the 5 minutes on the map. And our guests have been are prepared for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's go ahead and get started.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, first of all, I want to say thank you for welcoming the Gateway COG to present. I am Councilmember Larry Forester from the city of Signal Hill, a member of the COG. I have a PowerPoint. I think you will have a copy of it in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Let's look at the measure itself. This is what's stated on the ballot book. I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that myself and nine other cities sued against this, said it didn't meet current election law, and the judge ruled on a very narrow ruling that this was not put on by the populace so they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'could put anything they wanted. The Gateway COC voted to oppose the measure in 2000. July of 2016. Oh, I jumped over all the measure. M Where it's going to go. But when we voted to oppose it, the Gateway Cities looked at that measure and said it's priorities for new tax revenue or ignoring many of our cities in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the cog in the South Bay. That was confirmed when both in Councilmember Diane De Voice and Supervisor Duncan Harvey voted against it, both on the MTA board. The modeling project moves some projects in different locations, some out almost 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We felt that that was not what Measure R had said. The reconsideration has resulted in multimodal operations for the Gateway Cities that were leapfrogged by many other projects, and this given federal funding is a jump. Outside of the gateway card.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It simply is not geographically equitable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nor is it fair to our residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who will be funding these projects for decades before they see a benefit. Under the measure, I-5, which is now stopping and downhill, will go no further. I-405 i6 oh five i7 ten year end and the other end of both won't be completed for 30 to 40 years, despite recent offers of commitment from the regional mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is not written, and I must emphasize that I'm here because what's in the measure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is what the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Citizens are voting on, not the promises being made to us today. The City of Signal Hill and other cities, its commerce, El Segundo, La mirada and industry pay a disproportionate amount on this tax. When I look at and say Signal Hill, we are high.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sales tax, donate 7 million. We get 168,000 back. That's 2%. You get 23 to 26% back. With that. I just want to summarize that this is something that I personally can't support. Take the Hill City Council voted a week ago Tuesday to not support it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can't support it because it's not fair to the residents of the Southeast, nor to the residents of the South Bay. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We're going to save council. Come. You have another minute. If and forgive me, I said Diane Height. It's actually Karen Height, so forgive me for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Karen is our transportation deputy for the car and. She's my technical backup. But, you know, in the extra minute, it just it doesn't make sense. I've been on council 18 years. I represent the people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope where I present represent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Them well. I've been reelected. I cannot tell my citizens to vote for this flawed measure. I've been told by many people Eric Garcetti, Hilda Solis, John Fasano, that I will change it. Well, we've been asking for three years to have those changes put in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What happened? You know, I now have a measure that reads. As such. It doesn't have those changes in it. What guarantee do I have? So there's no way I can tell my citizens having representative for 18 years to support that measure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Gateway COG has taken the same position. So, again, thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much, Councilmember. So next we have Stephanie Wiggins, deputy CEO of Metro, who will also be allocated 5 minutes. Welcome. Welcome, Ms.. Wiggins.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Thank you. Thank you to the city council as well. I believe I have a PowerPoint as as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's make sure we restart the time to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The thank you. Starting the. Okay. Again, good evening to the council and to the residents of Long Beach Metro and the city of Long Beach, as well as the Gateway City City Council. Governments have a long history of collaboration in improving the transportation system in the southern part of the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in 2008, under Measure R, metro allocated a significant amount of funding to the Gateway Cities area. And since then, the colleagues, visionary thinking and active participation have supported us in aggressive development and delivery of transportation projects in the region, including within Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Since Diana gave a great basic overview of Measure M I'm going to skip through some of these slides and try to address some of the key issues of importance to Metro. One, we want to reiterate for the Council that this has been a collaborative approach and process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been a three year process with our Regional Partners, Cities and Council of Governments, as well as stakeholders from the business, social justice, environmental communities with a bottoms up approach to identifying what the needs are out there. As Diana said, we are we have board approval for Measure M on the ballot this November 8th, which is a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'brand new half cent sales tax and then an expiration of Measure R in 2039. The impacts of Measure M is essentially calculated about $0.05 on a $10 purchase. That's an average of $24 per person per year based on average spending.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are a number of major transit and highway projects which are the crux of the expenditure plan. I'm going to focus on the impacts to Long Beach. Dana went over many of these, so I won't repeat it. I will say there are elements beyond the major projects, such as operations that support Long Beach Transit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have a local street's local return that you're very familiar with. A new one that I do want to highlight for the city council is the state of good repair. Increasingly, we have an aging infrastructure. We know that with Long Beach being at the forefront of rail in L.A. County's history, with the advent of the blue line'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so as rail lines get older, we need to make sure we don't defer maintenance on those lines. Interview Who ride a blue line today. Know that we've had power outages, we're experiencing the impacts of delays and we wanted to make sure that we could have funds available to make sure we can upgrade that system, continue to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'make it state of the art, improve its safety, reliability, as well as not for a blue line, but all the other rail lines and any new rail line. So our board has proposed a new earmark from this expenditure plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've never done it before in our history and that is to actually have an earmark for a state of good repair or ongoing maintenance of the system. Another new element of the program that benefits Long Beach residents is also to have an earmark for our most vulnerable populations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is our seniors, our students, and our disabled. The seniors, as many of you know, with over 190 senior housing places in Long Beach, it is the fastest growing population in L.A. County. And so increasingly, mobility is an issue for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, we have a new earmark for bike and pedestrian connection to connections to transit here again in this area. Long Beach has been at the forefront. You started your bike share before anyone else in the county. We also know that transit dependent populations also tend to be high pedestrian and bicycle users.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So having this earmark is very important. And while we do not have regional rail or Metrolink in Long Beach, we do provide connections to Long Beach residents, to Metrolink through Union Station, and we're proposing to continue an earmark for that service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really important, as many of you know, with an expenditure plan, that there be accountability built into the measure, just like we have with propositions. AC And are we're proposing to do the same here. But building upon those lessons learned, we have an Independent Taxpayers Oversight Committee that has an expanded number of participants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going from three judges to a seven member expert panel. They will review, among other things, the entire plan. It's an assessment. It's not a replacement of the plan to identify the performance of the plan. It's important to note that the Independent Taxpayer Oversight only can review and comment to the board about the plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They cannot make changes to the plan. Amendments to the plan are subject to such restrictions or firewalls. However, project acceleration can happen at any time with a two thirds vote of the vote, and I'll expound upon that later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are impacts of the measure calculated by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation. Almost a half a million jobs will be created through Measure M. Clearly, this can be a local economic stimulus program. It's been proven that way with Measure R in terms of providing local jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the challenges, as you've heard from the previous speaker, that some projects will go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Forgive me, Ms.. Wiggins, but we need you to conclude so we can be fair to both opposition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Let me conclude by saying a couple of things. Project accelerated acceleration has been a key. We've been hearing it from stakeholders across the region. We did have a performance modeling process. We looked at geographic equity as well as other provisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's important to note that these performance metrics were approved by the board. We are also committed to ongoing acceleration. We have a meeting this Friday with the secretary Kelly on the priorities and goods movement projects for the five in the 710.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And to all of our presenters, let's give them all around applause for coming in and joining us down here in Long Beach. At this point, we have some counsel, some council comments. Then we'll go to public comment, beginning with Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you very much for the presentations, everyone. I think this was very educational, at least for me. I didn't know much about this proposition prior to tonight, so I do have a few questions and they were touched on through the presentations, but perhaps staff could could guide me through some of these.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if Measure M were to pass, what would the sales tax in the city of Long Beach be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman in the city of one each the sales tax with measure passing the current measure ah measure A from that just passed in June, our sales tax would be 10.25%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what is it in? In nearby cities, like if, you know, in Orange County City's SEAL Beach or Los Alamitos.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman, I didn't compare our sales tax to those in Orange County, but the base sales tax in L.A. County is currently 9%. Proposition 30 sales tax, the quarter cent sales tax is scheduled to expire at the end of this calendar year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that'll take it down. But then there are increases with Measure A and then measure are still in in effect as a house that sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then it's important to remember that measure is $0.01 for six years and then drops down half cent. So it would go down after that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what about Measure M? Is this expected to sunset at any time?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Measure, as it is currently written, does not have a sunset now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it'll stay the same consistent rate. It's not expected to be reduced after a certain period of time. Like Measure was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember? No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are there any limitations in terms of Measure M expenditures? I noticed on one of your slides on page 12, you talk about what the project types include. Are there any limitations to this?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Bear with me in just one moment while I get to that slide. Carl Zimmer. The project types that are included on on slide number 12 are projects that are eligible to be funded via local return. So that is the amount that the City of Beach receives directly from Metro as a part of this ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The ballot measure itself funds a number of other projects, including state of good repair system connectivity projects. If you could let me get to that page.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Page 11.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the ballot measure itself. Actually, there's funding for transit and operating and maintenance. There's funding for first and last mile capital improvements from existing transit stops and future transit stops. There's funding for highway improvements, active transportation and complete streets, and then as well as the local return formula.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you talk to me a little bit more about the local return? I'm not sure I understand that. That phrase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So the local return is the the phrase that is used to describe the direct level of funding that cities can receive from this ballot measure. So all cities will receive 17% directly back to cities for our expenditure on the two project types that you saw on slide number 12.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That number will jump from 17% to 20% upon the expression of Measure R and 2040. So that's increased funding directly to the city of one, which for use as we see fit as as it's eligible for streets and roads in the same way that we currently spend the funding in Measure R.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and if I could just add to that measure, our funding, something that we did in the last time we did a sales tax increase through Measure R, we really fought for that language to make sure it's as flexible as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Other county money tends to be used only for transit quarters like A and C, but Measure R is really open and flexible for transportation uses. And that's really what we in the city of Long Beach used to fund our residential street program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Other than that, there really is no source of transportation money that can fund residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so the $7 million annually is that the projected annual revenue until 2040?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is correct. That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So then at 2040, that 7 million would go up because our percentage would go from 17 to 20. Yes. Okay. So that $7 million that would come directly to the city and could that be you? Are there any limitations to how the city could use that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it limited to just what's listed here?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At this time it is. Metro still has to adopt guidelines and regulations for how we can use that money. We expect that it will be substantively similar to what is in Measure R and enumerated in the ballot resolution as it's described for green streets, complete streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And a lot of the active transportation type initiatives that we in Long Beach have, I've taken a lead in doing in the region.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So could we use it for I mean, just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really basic terms, could we use it for a residential street repaving?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that is an eligible use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And is there who has the discretion in terms of how the money is used? The 7 million is in solely in the city's discretion on how they want to use that money like Measure R.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, that is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is there any sort of an oversight body for Measure M or any one that would make sure that the expenditures are within the the framework of the the measure, as it's worded now?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So the ballot measure does include a plan for an independent oversight board, as Metro had described earlier. If you'll allow me to flip to that page one moment. I believe that's a seven member panel comprised of seven members, one retired federal or state judge, one transit professional, a professional with a minimum of ten years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Experience in management and experience and financial policies. Professional with experience on large scale construction projects. A licensed architect or engineer, a regional association or business representative, and three members of the committee and the members of the committee must reside in an L.A. county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you very much. I have no additional questions, Mr. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Gonzalez?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You. I have a couple questions as I see here, and I think they've mostly been answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Woman price. But I have a question related to, of course, our larger projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of them I would like to see completed shoemaker, bridge, ward, low grade separation, especially being the worst in the county and then the potential for light rail and then added.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Additional safety measures for the blue line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So are these not dedicated? They're not dedicated funding within the measure, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember funding for the ward. Low grade separation is in the expenditure plan as attachment a it's a footnote item number five. I'll can read it to you very briefly that your board of directors will prioritize the Wardlow Grade Separation Project to receive new funding and or grants and assign this project to be included in Metro's State of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good Repair program. And with respect to to the Shoemaker Bridge, that item is also footnoted as item F, I believe, as a note as part of the I7 ten South Corridor Project, Phase one Early Action Project. And that is in the ballot measure as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So because I see here it says the increased revenues are not Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Projects described within.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The ballot measure, but not as specific line item expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. So the ballot measure includes a number of attachments in in the expenditure plan. The one that is most detailed specifies project names, has a schedule of funds available and sequenced groundbreaking dates. And in in that portion of the expenditure plan, our projects are the word low grade separation specifically is not listed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The funding for Shoemaker Bridge is a part of the I-70, but Shoemaker Bridge itself is not a specific line item in the detailed expenditure plan. Okay, great. I think those are all the questions that I have for now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council Member Super nine. You know, I'd like to reserve questions till after the public speaks, but I just had one very quickly that there's a, I believe, a Sequoia component to Measure R is that sort of wave for residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then how does that factor into measure? And if anyone knows.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So we can get you a more detailed explanation on square. But I don't we don't do a higher level sequel clearance for those is just part of our normal street work and they fall under a secret exemption.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So residential streets would be just, you know, done the way we would do other normal maintenance projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Yes, thank you, Councilmember Price, for answering some of the questions I also had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had one question that just came up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm curious if. The dollars that come through with these projects be covered by our city wide project labor agreement. Sorry. Curveball.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it depends on what types of projects they are. Our project labor agreement has a threshold of 500,000 projects and higher. However, projects in the right of way that are typically streets are not currently covered by the project labor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But if there are other types of projects that don't fall in that description, then anything over 500,000 would trigger appeal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thank.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You. And do we have any. I'll just make a statement and say that it seems like it'd be something that would create a lot of local jobs and a lot of great opportunity. And I read the memo upstairs and I left it upstairs, but it was great to see that it was highlighting a lot of green investment'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and transit oriented and the fact that it's not just rail, but that it could be used for bike mobility and everything else. This seems like a great opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Push us in the right direction that we've already started taking a lead on. And yeah, I'll leave it there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. In seeing a more public comment here, let's go ahead and open it up to the public for any public comment here in the audience on our study session.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. My name is Don Darren Hour, our I'm with the Senior Citizen Commission. And at one point it was mentioned that according to the Metro, that Measure M would designate special funding for transportation for seniors who are their fastest growing population.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just like to ask how that is going to be applied to seniors and what the amount would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this isn't the point to ask any questions, but I'm sure staff can be here to answer those. Afterward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like that to be made public, however.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very good. I'd like to see the MTA set up a paradigm and where we have leaving from the transit mall, maybe 6 to 8 express busses that leave the transit mall, get on the freeway, perhaps at Wardlow or even before that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think Wardlow would probably be the best and barrel up the freeway in the bus lane down to seventh and fig and then have an equal number coming back in the evening. I think that makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Instead of going to Europe, in addition to that, have everything green lighted out of Long Beach. You know, it takes 20 some 20 to 24 minutes often to get from here to Wardlow. And that's ridiculous. We stop at every red light possible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. And seeing no more public comment, we're going to take it back behind the rail. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I want to thank. Larry in Gateway Cities called for their presentation. I want to thank Stephanie Wiggins from MTA and Staff for an excellent staff report. I thought it was very important that we bring this item forward for a study session.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, it is a major issue facing the voters in L.A. County on the November ballot. I did have a couple of questions. And just in full disclosure, I am the city's representative, along with Councilmember Urunga on the Gateway City's Council of Governments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I currently serve as the president. I can tell you that that the Gateway Cities did vote to oppose this measure a couple of months ago. And I want to just commend Mayor Garcetti. I want to commend the MTA for sticking with it in terms of having ongoing conversations with the the all of the gateway cities, individual cities'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and trying to understand the projects and the importance of the major projects and how it impacts the residents in. And there has been a lot of back and forth. This is a very, very I would just say, very highly political issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I see light at the end of the tunnel potentially. Ultimately, this is going to be up to the voters not only in the city of Long Beach, but throughout the county and our values and. In terms of a regional transportation will be put to the test to complement Measure R.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There were a couple of questions that that I do have. I want to ask the question that Mr. Donna were asked in terms of how the measure and proposes to to benefit seniors. I know there was a like a $2.4 billion number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What specifically will be done to aid the senior population? Just one question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for allowing me to clarify that. So with the earmark for seniors, students and disabled. The idea is to keep fares affordable. So we currently have a discount program for seniors, and this funding would ensure that we can continue that discount available for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, for seniors, both students K through 12, as well as college students and community college students. And then for our disabled riders, that's the purpose of that funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, thank you so much. And then there was a lot and Councilmember Pearce mentioned the jobs, local jobs that could be created. I believe the number in the presentation was through the from the L.A. EDC. So we're over 460,000 new jobs will be created by Measure M If somebody could ask me whether or not those jobs, is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that an annual on an annual basis or is that over the life of the project? And what type of jobs will they be?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excuse me. I'll stay closer. It is estimated for the life of the project. For the program, at least the first 40 years where we were able to actually articulate specific projects. So that's what that relates to. And we can make the full report by L.A. EDC available to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But they identify both direct and indirect jobs, construction related jobs, planning jobs, or principally construction related jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And in terms of the major projects for for the city of Long Beach, I know it was mentioned regarding the I-70 and Freeway. Staff, can you tell us where we are with that, that project in terms of shovel readiness and and when that project will be funded in the measure M schedule?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Vice Mayor Richardson threw the chair to Councilmember Austin. The the project 710 project currently is in IRR phase. It is moving towards a final year. You will actually receive a project update on Friday at the project committee meeting that's taking place at 11 a.m., where Metro staff will come and discuss where they are in the development of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the environmental review and the measure that's proposed. Measure M proposes funding in 2020 647, ten, actually breaking ground and moving forward with the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Why have you there? Can you also explain the war? Low grade separation? Footnote what? That project actually. Made do or proposes to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, sir. Through the chair again of Council Member Austin, the ward low grade separation proposes to look at redesigning the WARDLE station. Currently, it is a station that has a number of problems related to traffic in and around the station and the way that people get to and from the trains.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we have been working with Metro at relooking at that station and whether or not there's an opportunity to take the rail below ground and separate it from the grade so that you could still have traffic traveling over and the trains would come down, re-imagine what that what that station could look like and help improve overall'",
        "'speaker_8': 'transit around the area, both for cars and for busses and for the trains themselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'll go ahead and add to that at the Metro June board meeting. As Mayor Garcetti's supervisor, Don Carnaby and Mayor Dubuffet put forth a motion to look at grade crossing, pedestrian safety gates, fare enforcement and safety station maintenance and station gate installation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The board also voted to initiate a feasibility study to improve safety and security at the Blue Line Ward Low Station. And so there are a number of blue line improvements in in Metro's plan to upgrade the blue line in in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so even though it's not detailed in the expenditure plan with the specific groundbreaking dates, this is something that the City of Long Beach has been working with Metro on and hopefully with increased funding can make a reality.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you very much. You know, I'm going to keep my comments very brief in the interest of time and understanding that we have a big agenda ahead of us. I can tell you that this conversations regarding Measure M are happening daily.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a lot of activity around this to look at alternative funding and identifying federal funds to help with some of these projects as well. And much hasn't been talked about in terms of propositions A, C and A and C in terms of funding available and how that can be leveraged as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On October the sixth, the Gateway City cargo will reconvene. And this is this item will be agenda ized again. And so I will just just ask that the voters do do what you need to do to do your due diligence to understand this issue and weigh out the benefits that this potentially could have or not for the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And as we go into the second round of comments, let's just remind everyone we have a full city council meeting to go to next. So, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor. I think I think this is an important topic, so I appreciate your indulgence. And going into the second round of comments, I do have some follow up questions regarding some of the things that have come up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there a disbursement schedule.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What? How will the funds be routed to the individual cities? What's the timeline for that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So on the local return we will likely receive the measure and funds as we do measure are so they will be included in our annual budgeting process and factored into our capital improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so how soon with those funds start to come in to the city of Long Beach? They do. They come in on an annual basis, quarterly basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That we we may have to go back and check with, but they will not be any different than how we receive measure our local return funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I'm interested. I mean, my colleagues have made some really great points. And yes, all of these projects bring about more jobs, which is definitely good for everyone. But the concern that I have is that the sales tax in the city of Long Beach is going to be incredibly high as a result of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, we just had a very passionate discussion about minimum wage and trying to make sure that our residents are set up for success. And I'm concerned about, you know, how increasing sales tax for individuals will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, how that will impact people. So that's that's my preliminary concern, hearing hearing these discussions in terms of some of the big projects that we have, not the local transfer, but that the bigger projects that are part of measure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when are those monies expected to come to the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The funding for Shoemaker Bridges in early action 710 project is slated for 2026 in the expenditure plan. Funding for Wardlow for the grade separation does not have an expected groundbreaking date yet, but that is something that we're actively working with Metro on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's 2016 and we expect the funding to come in about ten years for one of the major projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Would that be the earliest project that we'd get funding for? Of the identified project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of the identified project. That is the earliest project that is identified. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That our residents would be paying into measure for that ten years without any other. The bigger project starting in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. In the meantime, we will be getting the local return revenues back in approximately 7 million. But for the larger projects, the earliest one that is slated is Shoemaker in 2026.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. One point of clarification is I believe there is some funding and perhaps Mr. Wiggins can correct me if I'm wrong before 605 Freeway. It is an issue that we are dealing with on the east side with regards to the bottleneck from the Orange County side leading into 605.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so if. If I may indulge Ms.. Wiggins in answering my question as to whether or not six or five funding comes earlier than 2026. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Arturo. So in the expenditure plan, there is an earmark for the six or five hotspots interchange project. It's $1,000,000,000 from Measure M that's earmarked for that program and it would start collecting money, money being allocated to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe anyway 18 and 19 at the latest. There are also would be money directly on day one, Long Beach Transit as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one thing I'll add about the major Long Beach projects, if we are to secure federal funding or are able to make a strong case to the Metro Board of directors, we are able to move projects up with a two thirds vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So if we had like a map, a cost matching or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Moving projects up an expenditure plan would require a two thirds vote from the Metro Board of Directors, and so I would assume that they would want a number of qualifying factors presented to them for that vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the two thirds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vote was going to be my question, but I'll just hopefully end on tonight and saying that, you know, we when we invest in our cities and we invest in infrastructure and we invest in things like our waterways or our sewers, ensuring that our transit system is strong when we're innovating technology and investing in that, that's when we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'get great cities and that this is another opportunity to do that. And so I'm very thankful for the study session today and learned a lot. Thank you, guys.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I'll just say just to close it out that, you know, we had our own discussion about a sales tax here in Long Beach that took a lot of our focus. And I have to admit myself, I'm just finally turning my eye to November and all the things that are coming down in November.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I do want to thank staff and thank all the speakers for their diligence in the presentation tonight. And I know that, you know, a lot of times with discussions like this, they you know, sometimes you don't get everybody on the same page.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The one question I do want to ask is, how have we I haven't necessarily paid attention. So forgive it if forgive this question. But has there been a level of engagement outside of these city council meetings, perhaps the business community, environmentalists, community?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has there been some level of engagement or are people surprised by this measure? And I'll ask that of city staff or or of Metro.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. There's been a tremendous amount of engagement. In March of this year, when we released our draft plan, we went had in-person community meetings at all nine subregions. We also held telephone town halls through all major subregions where we were able to reach thousands of residents of L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had online forums and we received thousands of comments during this public comment period. In addition to that, working with business chambers, environmental groups, social justice groups, as well as engaging with our Council of Governments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Certainly. Thank you so much. And that concludes our study session. Thank you very much. And let's go ahead and reset. We're going to take a moment just to reset and get ready for our city council meeting. Just a moment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. We are going to go ahead and transition into the rest of our meeting here in just a second. We're just going to start in just just a minute. Okay. Thank you. I want to thank the council here who has had some good discussions so far tonight and a couple announcements just to'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And I'm not sure if these were made earlier. Vice Mayor But I just repeat some of them. Our first presentation that we're going to go to, our first item is we're going to take the item surrounding the Olympics conversation up first, then we're going to take the presentation and discussion on the Queen Mary, which will come up'",
        "'speaker_9': 'next. Then I have an announcement on item number 15, which is an item by Councilwoman Pryce. That item will actually is going to be we're going to take it up later, but it's going to be postponed, I believe, to the next council meeting or Councilman Price is going to ask for that that discussion to be postponed to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the next council meeting. So if anyone's here for that, just as an FII, the item around ARVs will be taken up, I believe, as you're going to make that October 4th. Okay, October 4th. We're also going to be moving up our commission appointments and then as well, I believe it's the item 24.'"

(Citywide)": [
        "'speaker_9': 'And so a lot of moving today because we have people that have time certains but we'll try to get through everything as best possible. And so we're going to go first into the item around the Olympics, which is item 25, which we need to get out of the way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So Madam Clerk, read the item and then I'm going to kick us off and turn it over to staff.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Let me let me just go ahead and begin I want to just begin by saying over the last approximately 6 to 7 months, we've been working directly with Mayor Eric Garcetti and the L.A. 2024 Committee to ensure that Long Beach is well-represented.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as part of the official United States Olympic bid, which we know that Los Angeles is carrying the flag for our country in the 2024 round. As we probably are aware, many of the sites initially that were released preliminarily were out in the public.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And since that time to today, I really want to thank but particularly our city staff for working with us so closely to ensure that we would be well represented as part of the bid. But in addition to that, I want to thank the our convention visitors bureau staff who did fantastic work to ensure that our Olympic bid'",
        "'speaker_9': 'know the quality of events that we're able to really put together here in the city of Long Beach. In addition to that. I want to just say that Long Beach has a long history with the Olympics. This is an Olympic city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have hosted games and events in this community. We have almost more Olympians in any other major metropolitan area and certainly one of the largest cities that produces Olympics anywhere in the country, particularly when you're talking about all of our events that happen to do with swimming and volleyball and all of our aquatic events.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so there's a strong tradition of the Olympics here. The to be a part of the United States bid, we know, would be historic and would also be, I believe, if structured appropriately, which I know we would, an incredibly strong economic benefit to the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so, again, I want to thank Mayor Garcetti for his partnership, and I look forward to being able to move forward and bring the Olympics not just to Los Angeles, but bring the Olympics to Long Beach as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that. Mr. MODICA.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And then if there was any costs that aren't going to be covered, we would come back to the city council at a later date. We would essentially save that time for them. And then if we are selected next September 2017, we would essentially be talking more in specificity about costs and what that would look like in our'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city. So we're available for any questions. And we we know we're going to get questions about what those events are. And we expect to hear very soon from L.A. 24, announcing all those proposed locations and exactly which events are going in which cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they're going to make that announcement soon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And and with that, I have a motion to second Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I just want to thank city staff for their hard work as well as our mayor. I know this is incredible for our city. We are an Olympian city. I would also like to see when we get that information, what type of economic impact that will bring to our city, because I know it will be, you know'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And I know it's really preliminary and there's still a lot to learn, but I just want to express how exciting this is potentially to have be on the world stage, you know, right here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is, I would say, once in a lifetime. But I think we've calculated with 40 years since the last time I was in L.A. so maybe twice in a lifetime opportunity. But we're really excited about this and I hope it all works out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. When I go, the sentiment for my colleagues, I think this is a great opportunity to continue to keep Long Beach on the map, to celebrate the assets that we have in this city. Looking back at the other two years that we had the Olympics in Long Beach, from just some initial research, it looks like we did'",
        "'speaker_6': 'make money and then additional funds that were made were actually invested back in the youth programs. And there's a commitment from the Olympics to continue to do that investment. So really looking forward to what might come and continuing to have the conversations about what economic impact there might be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And public comment, please. Anyone from the public.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very good. You click as the address. As I mentioned when it was first announced, a number, you know, two years ago, I fully support the concept. There's no reason why we can't duplicate what happened in 1984. If. The bid is structured properly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My analysis, my perspective comes from having studied the bidding process when I first became involved in the growing community in 2000, in 1984, excuse me, 1982, two years before the games. And I've been studying it ever since. And my sense is that we can certainly do it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that is particularly true if it's well-managed. The key will be having say so. I'll make a very blunt. But before, as you remember, I had after the Paris attack attacks, my position was and it still is I don't think it would prevail still is that the U.S. should stand down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This term, this bidding cycle, support this republic's oldest ally. Having said that. The key to SoCal receiving the bid. Will depend upon the Long Beach, the enhanced new Long Beach Marine Stadium. If the Marine Stadium is not the rowing venue, so Cal will not prevail.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that comes from an analysis and understanding of the IOC and its culture. The. And I'm not in the IOC. But the the growing dynamic within that IOC. It is the oldest. There is. And those members are embedded in a civic, social, financial, governmental, military paradigms.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Other countries, the former British Commonwealth, the former Great Britain, all those countries, the former Soviet Union, South America. They want to come here, period. Lake Casitas turned out to be a turnoff to far away, even driving, speeding up at speeds I won't tell you about on barren freeways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They and they recognize that. Then the second place they were going to put it in, the sign was Balboa Lake Balboa in the middle of San Fernando Valley in the summer with 103 degree heat. That's absurd on its face.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The last announced location was as far down the coast, but beyond at or near Chula Vista, which is the same as well, distant up out of Lake Casitas. It's too far from the Olympic vibe and so forth. Long Beach Marine Stadium with the enhanced enhanced open channel, which apparently should be remembered, was.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Genesis, for that. So it was the USOC Olympic Committee. Thank you for that was their idea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Unfortunately, you're going to hear time all day. Time is up. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Much and understand the appeal.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'a traffic circle. The traffic circle was built for the 1932 Olympics, and it's not in real good shape right now. So I'd like to see us get some enhancements in there. So if we did bring visitors to the site, they would enjoy that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, we have Lakewood Boulevard in my district. That was part of the 1984 Olympic torch run. And I think just showing visitors those historic sites may mean a lot. And I haven't discussed this with the councilmember from the first District, but actually a vacant lot at the corner of 14th and Locust won the contest that the local'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And I think absolutely. I think if tonight goes and proved, I understand that management worked directly with the 2024 team. And then if awarded, there will be a long series of of involvement of the council as well as the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the community will be asked to participate. It will be a huge city wide effort, and I think that's an excellent suggestion and idea. See no other comments on this. Members, please go. Oh, there's another public comment. Sorry, I didn't see you there.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Linda Thank you, Mayor, and members of the Council. I'd like to start by just acknowledging the staff that worked on this incredible project, and that would be to my left here, Fernandinho, who's the planning staff? She was the project manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd also like to recognize one of the our department's interns, Olivia Jonge, as well as our department director, Amy Bodak. And I would also like to acknowledge the assistance that we had, the very capable assistance we had from a project designer, an architect, a local architect who assisted the task force in their deliberations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I'd just like to introduce the overview of this project by acknowledging that the selection of a new leaseholder for the Queen Mary site was a very opportune time for the city to step back from the site and take the opportunity to really significantly reimagine what could occur on the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's an underutilized site. And this time and the appointment of the task force really played a critical role for the city to re vision that site. So with the mayor's creation of the task force there, their charge was multifold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was, to, number one, recognize the Queen Mary ship, but also to re-envision the site as a world class destination, something that that could be and also to for the task force there key role was really to provide leadership in that deliberation and in that conversation with the community, their charge was to get a broad base of'",

He's the vision for the site. And that resulted in the Queen Mary document that the draft document that you have in front of you in the course of their appointment over'",
        "'speaker_0': 'about eight months, they had a total of ten meetings. And during those meetings they routinely had very active community input and participation. Those meetings included presentations on topics related to the President, related to the topic of the vision, but also some very specialized presentations such as a potential aerial tram for the site, as well as the restoration'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of a historic carousel. So those were some of the topics. In addition, they had several design featurettes that were hosted by the architect Gwyn Pugh and his firm to facilitate that discussion. So I'd like to briefly just summarize the guiding principles that were that drove the the ultimate vision for the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They started out with, first and foremost, the acknowledgment that the the Queen Mary ship really is the focal point. It serves a significant iconic cultural landmark for the city. And the idea is that whatever development occurs on the site should recognize the Queen Mary and its contribution to the city's history and culture, and that any development of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the site just needs to compliment the Queen Mary. But the task force didn't forget that the other key role or the key objective of the development of the selection of a leaseholder is to really begin the process of developing that site so that it can allow funding to restore the Queen Mary to its historic grandeur.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another one of the key principles was esthetics for the site. And the important component here was that whatever is developed on the site, that it's attractive and that it's it is authentic architecture that really reflects the setting of the site itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other key point that the task force recognized was that whatever happens on the site, it has to have broad public access, not just getting into the site easily, but also just getting out of the site and providing very ample and adequate parking for the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another one of the guiding principles was connectivity. I think that there was a lot of focus that talked about how the site itself needs to be connected not only to the downtown, but also the activities and the the various events on the site must be connected to each other and that the public and those visiting the site'",
        "'speaker_0': 'must must have a different options or modes for actually access in the site. And also connectivity included visual access. It's not just getting around the site, but having the site be visual or be actually visible from the downtown and other parts of the city, as well as promoting the great views of the site itself across into the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'downtown area. Also the notion of complete community. The task force wanted to make sure that we weren't just creating a single purpose type of setting. The idea was that there would be multiple purposes for there, and that would include everything from social, cultural, educational opportunities as well as hospitality for the site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it was really important that when you go to the site, it could serve a multiplicity of functions for for visitors as well as for local residents. Also iconic. That was the term that is intended to make sure that whatever gets developed on the site, not only does it respect the Queen Mary ship, but that be iconic'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in and of itself. So that, again, those views of the site of the Queen Mary site from the downtown and other parts of the city reflect something that's very substantial and and worthy of the the location on that piece of property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And lastly, the the task force deliberated on this one a lot and we added it. They added it at the last minute that because it kept coming up in the conversation, the need for this outdoor venue, this very unique outdoor venue to provide a very iconic and a high quality outdoor venue that would rival other local regional'",
        "'speaker_0': 'venues such as the Hollywood Bowl. The thought was that this would be unique because of its waterfront location and that it was certainly a a and a great unique opportunity for the the city to take advantage of. So with that, the other major component that went into the the guiding principles that are reflected in the document are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a number of about seven or so key themes. And these are the key themes and elements that were were tossed out. There are tons of ideas that came out of the various members of the of the task force.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And but they were all coalesced around these key themes that are represented here. They were things like not just the sense of arrival or creating a sensible arrival, but having the arrival to the site be an experience in and of itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Making arrival there easier with wayfinding. Making, as I mentioned earlier, circulation to the site, getting to the site and and traversing the site itself through different modes, be it walking, biking, coming to the site, using other modes of transportation, including your cars, the water, taxi, but just be highly accessible however you choose to get there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also making the parking accessible. And the other consideration was the esthetics and the design of the site. The idea, again, was to make sure that the the site and the the architectural features and everything was cohesive and really made the site that that world class destination that will be attractive not only to local residents who may want'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to spend an afternoon there, but for an international visitor, for example, who may stay at a local stay at the hotel on the site and spend the weekend there. So the idea, again, making sure that the site is attractive, that it is welcoming, that the building is all the buildings on the site are cohesive and they orient'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and enhance the Queen Mary itself, enhance the site and make it a world class destination. The other component was the open space. The task force felt that it was really critical to take advantage not only of the park site, but the open space of the site itself and with the orientation of buildings, the placement of the buildings'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to make sure that those open space corridors are actually maintained, so that at no time is the site overdeveloped. So you don't get to continue to take advantage of multiple open space opportunities on the site as well as open space views.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then lastly, the key uses of the site. The task force spent a lot of time and they had a lot of great ideas. And again, these are summarized in the they're presented in a little bit more detail in the document itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the idea is that there would be a variety of uses, cultural uses, entertainment uses, recreational uses, hospitality. Again, the ultimate goal being to have the site be a world class destination that that brands the city of of Long Beach, as well as the Queen Mary itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I'd like to close out the presentation by talking about the next steps after the council takes an action on the these guiding principles. Tonight, we will be formally presenting them on the Mayor's behalf to the urban commons, the leaseholder and the I just to make sure that the you're aware that urban commons has been'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they attended many of the task force meetings and so they were they were there we know that they were listening to the incredible feedback that came directly from the community and from the task force. And the idea is that these guiding principles will inform their ultimate design of something truly iconic, something truly esthetic, and that really enhances'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the site. And we will look forward ultimately to their submittal of a set of plans for the long term development of the site. And that concludes staff's presentation. Be happy to answer any questions you might have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And I know that before we get the questions, I'm going to have Mr. Bowen come up, who's going to say a few words on behalf of the task force. And he led our group along with Mr. Hoffman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, thank you. As the chair of the Queen Mary Task Force. We are very proud and excited about the document. We've put a lot of energy into it and we think that this could be a really great document for the developer and the community to use as a guide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We hope that you support the document that we produced today. I also want to say that I want to thank the mayor for putting this group of task force members together. They were the best. They're very passionate. They're very talented and knowledgeable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And everything that's in this document has a reflection from all of the members. Didn't always agree, but we always were able to work things out and we think we have a really phenomenal document. I also wanted to thank Gwen Pew and Linda with Urban Studio.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They were the consultants that helped facilitate some of the community meetings as well as our meetings, and they are one of the best in Southern California. I've worked with a lot of different firms and they're really wonderful. It was a really great choice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to thank the city, particularly Linda Tatum and for I know for being very patient with us, listening to us and being such great communicators. And so and then finally, I want to thank the community. We had many people that showed up to all the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had some that went to a few. We had about 60 to 70 people come to one of the workshops. And again, as an architect, I've been to hundreds of workshops, and I was the most proud of our citizens of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They were professional. They were respectful of each other. And they had a lot of great ideas. So there's a lot of their ideas that have permeated into this document as well. So we hope that the developer will find this document useful.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We hope the city will find it useful. And we hope that they will embrace the developer, will embrace many of the ideas that are in there, if not all of them. And we ask for you to support this document tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. The developer. Well, I think. Let's go ahead and Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for that. I want to first just thank everybody that has been a part of this process I attended as a resident before I got into council a few of the task force meetings and just thought that you guys asked a lot of phenomenal questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You gave a great opportunity for the community members to be involved. And everybody that attended, I think, came wholeheartedly with Let's Dream Big. And that dreaming big is how cities become great. But I also want to thank the mayor and previous vice mayor, Sara Lowenthal, for process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that our city has come a long way in the way that we envision things, the way that we say we're going to invest, whether it's homelessness, whether it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Recognizing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The gravity of what this piece of parcel is, and it's about process to put everybody in a room together and say, let's vision together. And that's how we get away from investing in projects that might not pan out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I am very hopeful that while we've spent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In the past talking about this site, talking about what it could mean, that this is the first opportunity that we've really had to invest in it with a vision that includes not part of the community, not some, but everybody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so just thank you to the mayor and previous vice mayor for that process. I've always been supportive of it, and I think that what we have here with these guiding principles is really historic. Not to say that, you know, people have come together and say we want to have a process that's that includes everybody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's historic because the Queen Mary is 80 years old. It is a place that is often sometimes people's first experience when they come to Long Beach. And it's a place to experience history. And I love and the guiding principles that it says, let's have a sense of arrival, because I think a lot of times you go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to the Queen Mary and that that parking lot just kind of stops you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it takes away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of the magic that could be experienced on the Queen Mary. And so having a place of arrival, but also having a place, a sense of an experience that you leave wanting to come back in. And so it's a historic day to be able to say that we as a city have spent time and energy and a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'process and didn't just throw money at something or make a decision in a silo. And so today for me is is about the vision of what we can have happen at the Queen Mary. But it's also about a process that's including everybody from workers to community members to the environment, to talking about transportation, to dreaming big, about'",
        "'speaker_6': 'having something that that brings people across the water to the mainland. Those are big, exciting ideas. And it takes a community that's wholeheartedly behind that to make that happen. And so I'm really excited to support the Guiding Principles today and excited about what's going to come in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you, everybody, for your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I, too, want to congratulate the task force. I think it's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Very.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mindful this work was just all encompassing. As Councilmember Pierson mentioned, she said it so well that, you know, this was a great process. It was a wonderful to be able to see all of this kind of come together and that all of you in your expertize.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know, Cheryl, I go to her for my historic preservation, anything related to historic preservation. I go to Cheryl and I'm glad she was a part of this. And so many of you will now have a lasting impression on the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because of your work. And so I also want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To acknowledge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Scott, who is in the audience as well. I know when I first got elected, we talked about a carousel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And adding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A carousel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the Queen Mary. And so I don't know if there has been any discussion on that and where that's at, but I know that there's been a lot. But Linda, would you like to answer that question?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. We actually had a presentation on the historic carousel and the potential for it to be located on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, wonderful. Because I heard all these magic things about this carousel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be a great addition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But thank you all for your tremendous work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. One of the things that I'm more accommodating now, when you talk about an iconic district, we know that the Queen Mary is iconic, is probably the most iconic feature that we have along our coast is Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the city of Long Beach itself has a long history. Used to be a naval town. Back in the day when I was a kid growing up in East Los Angeles, we would make a trek to the pike down at the town on the shore here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there were a lot of iconic structures there as well. I remember the the cyclone racer, the roller coaster, and you guys are too young. Probably the only one who remembers it. He probably built it. But you remember it well, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And right now, when we drive under under the under the bridge right there on the shoreline drive, we you see the light going up and down as if there was a rollercoaster there. So, I mean, I think that I'm not I'm not suggesting that we build a roller coaster along with a carousel, and that's a totally different'",
        "'speaker_3': 'project. But I think that we should look at some of those iconic structures or iconic features that Long Beach had back in back in its heyday. We're trying to bring back some waves. Look, we're studying the breakwater. So, I mean, we could look at inclusion of some of those features as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The carousel we just mentioned right now, which is somewhat of a throwback to the days when when the pike was activated and very and very well attended, millions of people kept along beaches to visit the park. So you want to include some of those that features that well as well, I think would be very beneficial.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and add to the the the development of an iconic district right around the Queen Mary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If food for thought.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Very. Summer Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I have a really important question. Where's the NFL stadium? I thought that was a part of this. I guess. I guess not. I would say.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think this is a I want to talk about the process. I think this is a great model for the city to select the task force and put together these guiding principles. I would imagine this would be very helpful to a developer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys did half the work, so hats off to the task force for doing that. And, you know, we need to think about replicating that model with with other developers. We, you know, partner with doing some of this outreach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm sure we'll get a tremendous product. There are some really great things here. One thing that I think is stood out to me the most is the potential for a performance facility like, you know, Hollywood Bowl type performance facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that would be a tremendous, you know, asset to our city that folks wouldn't have to go all the way to, you know, the Anaheim, you know, to Anaheim, to the Verizon or whatever they call that Anaheim Meadows.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know Irvine Meadows, whatever they call it, to change some names or go all the way out to Hollywood. But have something here, I think that could be really a hit. Also, it's it's you know, it's always been hard to describe when I when I have meetings or something at the Queen Mary or at Hotel My'",
        "'speaker_1': ', it's always hard to get people to to describe how to get to the south waterfront. So I love the creativity here in that we in the guiding principles make it easy in thinking about a gondola and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to say to all involved, so Staff Task Force Council is all involved. This is fantastic work and you should be proud of it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I want to echo the comments of my colleagues and thank the task force for their great work on this. I've had a chance to speak with a few of them who have reached out to me to explain kind of the process and their vision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I appreciate you taking the time to do that. I think it's going to be fantastic, and I really do believe that we need to have more venues to support the arts in the city. And using the the landscape that we have in this city is very important for us to think about in terms of our future'",
        "'speaker_5': 'planning. So thank you for the work that you do and the efforts that you put into this committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Any other public comment on this? Any public comment? Please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Council Members. One of the advantages of being real old is that this is kind of a repetition of what I've heard over the last 30 years of coming here. We actually had a presentation by the designer maker, manufacturer of a wooden roller coaster who wanted to put it over on that side, stood right'",
        "'speaker_8': 'here and suggested a wooden really coaster. Also was a large demonstration of the overhead gondolas. The manufacturers of that ride came by and we would leave from where Point Avenue was, was going to go crossed over there. But I think there may have been a missed opportunity because I know I didn't go any of the meetings, but'",
        "'speaker_8': 'had we had a different alignment in the in the cosmos, we may not have had to have this study because some of you who are old, I remember when Disneyland was going to develop the whole thing. And my thought was, is there any archival information of what Disney's design was?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there any way of getting hold of that? I mean, they're the best in the business doing what they do. I don't know what happened to shoot that down. But that's just a thought. Maybe someone in that task force could see if there is any archival designs, concepts, that kind of material around.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just wanted to share that with you. And so it was the roller coaster, the carousel and, and the gondolas have all been discussed at this council in previous years. Thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'have a stop sign at Broadway. So I'm wondering, is there an excess of paint in the city? I mean, we have like a lot of leftover paint that we have to get rid of because, you know, you know, a good idea is one thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But taken too far, you know, it gets a little bit crazy. And I think both with this parking thing, it seems like the second and third are kind of mixed up. Maybe the diagonal parking should go along First Street where our congressman lives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That seems to be a kind of off limits area first between Redondo and the park there. There's plenty of that's a very wide street. They need some parking there. I don't think those residents would be very happy about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But all I can say is, as someone who spends a lot of time going up and down Ocean Boulevard, you know, I just I just don't see anybody speeding. I walk a baby across there in a stroller. And I think you're trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist without going to the source of, you know, the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'people who would be most affected, the community. And I really wish you'd erase that left turn. LANE Everybody's going to start thinking we are a major thoroughfare on terminal, and it's been pretty quiet lately and we like it that way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. See no other public comment. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So a few things. Just to be clear, the item tonight is to set aside money for this project out of our infrastructure funds. So we're setting aside money for the project. We're not approving a project tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Having said that, this is a project that is a recommendation by the city's traffic engineer in regards to ways to reduce speed. It's not it's it's it's kind of like when we put additional stop signs in or we put additional lights on or we reconfigure roads, those aren't projects that necessarily come through the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I understand the concerns that everyone has, but we just added some lighting, some traffic lights on seventh and Santiago. We just did a Broadway road diet. Those items don't come before council. They come as a result of traffic engineering.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So having said that, I know our traffic engineers are here. I'm just going to go through a couple of points and then I'm going to ask if if Eric, if you wouldn't mind, Eric, what's coming up? Just so we can go through a couple of points and then for anyone who's here who feels that they don't have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the information or anything like that, please let me know. But I do. I do note that Susan was talking about a lack of transparency. I'll note that on we've been in communication, Susan and I have specifically on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And with this there was a presentation made to the Belmont Shore Residents Association, and then there was a meeting at the field office. And no, the PowerPoint was not functioning. Mr. Van Dike's PowerPoint was not functioning. So Susan did receive, as I said, everybody else who was there, including the neighborhood association, presidents, copies of the PowerPoint.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in fact, in the email that Susan sent on August 12th, she actually attaches a number of slides from the presentation. And I know that she had sent that email, you know, late in the afternoon or like almost 6:00 and and responded within a few minutes saying that she had concerns with the project but hadn't had a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'chance to see anything so or ask any questions. So, you know, there was obviously some some concerns about it and I get that. But in regards to transparency, at least for the speakers this evening, at least two of those speakers had a copy of the full PowerPoint and the traffic study.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The way this came to be is that a traffic study was requested through the Belmont Shore residents. We have repeatedly we get calls every day from residents and businesses on Ocean Boulevard saying that people are taking Ocean Boulevard in in order to avoid other streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's causing a lot of safety issues because pedestrians are almost getting hit crossing the street and that people are driving above the speed limit. So there was a request by the community for traffic engineering to do a study.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They did a study. It's actually a very thorough study. I think that's a great suggestion. Susan, we will put this on our website so that everyone has a copy of the study, but they did a study. It's an 11 page study and it goes through many aspects of Ocean Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Ocean Boulevard was designed and built for 25,000 vehicles a day of traffic. It currently gets in the peak months, 7000 cars traveling through it a day. So it was built for 25,000. It gets 7000. A lot of the residents suggested that we put in traffic I'm sorry, stop signs as a way to slow traffic down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is an area where really we have to defer to our traffic engineers to some extent because this is an actual science. They've they've done a lot of research and study on this. But stop signs aren't designed to slow traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're designed to indicate right of way. It is an in applicable use of stop signs to put them there to try to control traffic speeds. Traffic calming can only be achieved through engineering and design. And so the recommendation based on the size of this road and the number of vehicles that it receives is to do what's called'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a road diet. Some people have, you know, kind of made fun of the name. That's not really our name. That's a name that's in the traffic industry. I know that Eric came from Seattle. They did a lot of traffic road diets there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He's done one. He's done it in other cities. And again, the the road diet that was done on on Broadway has been extremely successful. We get thank you emails all the time from residents. So that's how the study was conducted and recommendations were made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it is those recommendations that were acting upon were acting upon Traffic Engineering's recommendation. So I would like Eric to just briefly speak on this, but I do want the public to know, and especially the folks who are here, we are going to have another meeting where we're going to talk about this a little bit more in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'detail and then also. The timing and the impacts that this is going to have on the community as we implement it. In regards to the peninsula that the woman that was here from the peninsula. I appreciate you coming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just so you know, the peninsula has the pic and within the pic they have a traffic committee. And the traffic committee originally had wanted to slow traffic by instituting these things called traffic humps, but they only wanted them on one side, one lane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they wanted a hump on one lane, but no hump on the other lane. Traffic engineering felt like that was not a good solution because cars would be driving around the lanes and also because nowhere else in the country had anyone implemented these traffic humps on only one lane of a two lane road.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what I said to the traffic committee and they were not very happy with me because my predecessor had agreed to implement these traffic humps. But what I said was that I did not feel comfortable implementing the traffic humps because they were not with the standard of traffic design, but that we would do a traffic study for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the peninsula. So they said, great. We did a traffic study at their request and all we did was present the findings and the recommendations of the traffic study. And there's going to be a presentation to the Peninsula Group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We haven't had that presentation yet, and I think that's going to happen in October. The money is being set aside, but that project is not going to get implemented for a while. And also the south and north side of ocean are not going to get implemented at the same time because we want to have an opportunity to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'see how this is working. Because if it's not working or if it's what people think it is, then we we can fix it. But our traffic engineers believe very strongly that this is going to have a positive impact.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've heard a lot of comments about diagonal parking. You know, this is an unusual diagonal parking scenario because the buffers and I think Erik can speak to it more, are a lot bigger than they would be in any other place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's there's a whole bike lane and there's a buffer before the bike lane. So it provides ample opportunity for for drivers. The people can say a lot of times that they think that diagonal parking is dangerous. There's really no data to back that up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, parallel parking has proved to be incredibly dangerous because we've had we've seen numerous instances where people are injured as a result of a driver opening their door and a bicyclist driving into the door. There's actually a lot of published data on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In regards to diagonal parking, there's really very little published data that talks about the dangers of diagonal parking. Finally, you know, this traffic study was done for the purposes of traffic, not for parking. The parking is just an added benefit of this design.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to allow for 156 additional parking spots for residents to park overnight free of charge in a parking impacted neighborhood. So that's just an additional added benefit. And although a lot of people don't like the change or the idea, you know, we don't want Ocean Boulevard to be a thoroughfare.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want it to be a safe place where residents and beachgoers can cross the street and not be concerned about travel vehicles traveling at a fast pace, which the data reveals that everybody speeds on Ocean Boulevard. So if you have an experience that I challenge you to stand over by the digital counter and just watch because my'",
        "'speaker_5': 'staff does it every day, we have one of our staff members who lives right there, and we've been tasked every staff member to drive through there every day at different times in advance of this road diet. So we have staff members driving there in the morning, in the afternoon and at night almost on a daily basis, because'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we want to make sure that we support a project that we think is going to work. And finally, when we talk about special events, traffic engineering has a whole plan in place for what we do for for special events.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for special events will be working with the Special Events Department in advance of the event to coordinate the traffic plan. And that means that some of these diagonal parking lanes will be opened up for thorough for for through bound traffic so that we do have two lanes on days where we have special events.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But as Erik often says, we don't design roadways for special events. We design them for the other 345 days of the year. So I'm going to allow, Erik, if there's anything that you want to add to what I said, just to kind of clarify anything that might be inaccurate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Price. I think you've done a great job of getting into the details. So Eric Wood, Strand City Traffic Engineer, we've completed two road diets in Long Beach this past year. Both are working very well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Broadway and Alamitos. The reason for doing the road date on Ocean is to improve safety for pedestrians. Crossing ocean is riding along ocean and drivers traveling along it. As Councilor Price mentioned, this road has an excessive capacity. We feel that the analysis done shows it will still function just fine with one lane each direction we take into'",
        "'speaker_8': 'consideration emergency vehicle access. We take into consideration the development coming in the corridor with the pool. And with the special events taking place during the summer, the road diet is not designed to increase congestion, but it is designed to get motorists to drive closer to the speed limit that if that results in people going a little slower'",
        "'speaker_8': ', that's okay. The slower people go, the safer it is for pedestrians. Reducing the street to one lane in each direction also means that pedestrians only have to cross one lane of traffic each direction, which is inherently safer. You do not have a multiple vehicle threat condition when that happens.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As Councilor Price mentioned, we've had several outreach meetings along the corridor. There'll be more outreach that takes place. The diagonal parking will provide a buffer between the parking lane and the bicycle lane, and then the travel in. This setup is also designed to allow emergency vehicle access along the corridor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Traffic data that was collected for the study was taken during the summer months, both on Thursday and Sunday of the summer months and also during the spring. As was mentioned previously, while I was at the city of Seattle, I conducted ten road diets that were successfully implemented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Most of them were controversial, but the results are in going in and working well. I also was a coauthor of the Road Diet Information Guide, published by the Federal Highway Administration. That concludes my comments. Thank you.'",
