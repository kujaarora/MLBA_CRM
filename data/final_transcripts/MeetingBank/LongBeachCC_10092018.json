We also heard that locally there are about 1900 trucking companies that are registered at the Port of Long Beach, representing 17,000 individual trucks.'",

And I asked my colleagues for support and providing additional insight and information from our city attorney's office on the protection of these proprietary interests, and especially Labor code violations at the Port of Long Beach.'",

I want to thank everyone that came out to speak today, as well as everyone that's come out to speak and engage in this issue, not only in the last several months since we've agenda business and Long Beach, but for the last nearly 20 years that we have been tackling this challenge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to, you know, echo that at every single commission meeting, I have made it really clear that while, you know, the issues that are happening with our truck drivers is one that's of great importance to me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The number one issue is our proprietary interest at the port and the fact that this is city land and that ports do have a legal ability and right to make sure that we're competitive, to make sure that we do not end up on the national market as a place of of unrest, of labor disputes that are consistently'",
        "'speaker_6': 'disrupting business and the flow of cargo. I think 16 strikes in five years is I think that sends a strong message. And I'm I don't know the answer, and I don't know that anybody on the council right now could answer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think it would be interesting to find out how many labor disputes have happened to this degree at any other port in the nation that might put at risk their competitive edge? Or is it just the L.A. Long Beach port that is facing this unrest?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that after the last five years, you've really seen that that unrest has increased and so much so into a civil disobedience with arrest this past week with hundreds of people down at the port. So I want to echo and urge support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that there's conversations around what labor peace looks like at our port, and I know that there are some legal concerns and questions. And I want to be real clear that we all are on the same page and understand that a labor peace agreement is not an agreement with a union.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is not requiring a business to go into a contractual agreement with a labor union, but rather that it is a it puts it on the company to make sure that there is labor peace, that there is not a conversation around workers going on strike or walking out that's going to disrupt the flow of products in our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'port. And so I hope that as we continue the conversation, that we really do dove in and make sure that we talk to many attorneys and that we understand our rights as a port and that we're doing the very best we can to end this disruption at our ports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that our staff has done a fantastic job. I've really enjoyed the committee meetings and I know that it takes a lot for workers to come out and speak. And I wish that we hadn't been doing this for the last 20 years, but I know that that there's a lot of progress being made.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to thank the leadership at the state level. I also want to recognize that there are several companies in our port that would like us to to end the labor disputes. I think that we. Let me see.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So I look forward to the next steps. I hope that the process is not lengthy and through several months, but that we can kind of come to some conclusion sometime soon. And so I want to thank again the port and the the commission for all of your hard work and urge my colleagues to support this.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Although here in Long Beach, it's it's an area where there is some prevalence. And there is no question, I don't think by anyone who's studied the issue that there has been misclassification taking place. And I think state legislation is going to go a long way in neutralizing and making it a fair environment to work and to compete'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I'm looking forward to that. I do think it's something that has to happen on a statewide level. I do appreciate the city attorney's guidance to us as policymakers. I think they've been very prudent and very clear in outlining the areas where the city has room for implementation or discussion on limitations thereof.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I appreciate what you have done in terms of the guidance you've provided. It is it's obviously an issue that affects many people. And there are very clear legal limitations in terms of what the city and the port can do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I appreciate the harbor commission and the port staff taking this issue on and it's been an eye opening experience on many levels. And to see where the the national trends are going in terms of a legal interpretation of employment status has been enlightening on many levels.'",

Whether or not you are represented, employee or not, you should be treated fairly. The truckers in our our ports deserve way wage protections, job security and healthy safety protections, just like any other worker.'",

And we've heard much testimony here today that leads to abusive practices by by some companies and their their customers, but by extension of SB 1402 now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our drivers are literally in. These poor drivers are literally driving the economy. There's some crazy number like 40% of our nation's economy comes to our ports. And that is that's a senior significant number. And for these workers not to be sharing in the wealth that they create in this country is just a damn shame.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we need to do more. And I'm not sure that this body has the power to do that. We are going to work within the confines and whatever we can do to do that. I'm sure that there's there's a resolve here among my colleagues to support fairness for for the truckers, port truckers in our in our city'",
        "'speaker_7': '. But we've got to work with Sacramento, and we're going to, I think, ultimately need some some federal intervention to to make this this this issue. Right. I want to be realistic, too. The looking at the numbers. I think, you know, we would we would do well to to get to a present, a place where at least 50%'",
        "'speaker_7': 'or more of those poor truckers are in an employment model. And I think there should be be some some some regulations in place similarly to and I've been thinking about this quite a bit over the last several months, similarly to how we we regulate the construction industry with prevailing wages.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think there needs to be some sort of prevailing wages for for poor truckers as well, too, to ensure that we are being fair and that they are being treated fair. And again, benefiting from from the great wealth that they are creating for for our our country.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they deserve fair compensation. I can't can say that enough. They I'd like to think that this model that we currently have and I've heard this for years, I've been around long enough to to 20 years to to understand, you know, where it went when this this first started with with with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With the labor organizations that have been working to so, so tirelessly over the last 20 years to to get us to a place where these these workers are sharing in the economy as well, and have been on the lines the job actions with these workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I'm going to say that I am fully supportive of their efforts to to to actually unionize and become part of the collective bargaining process. That, too, is the American way. And so the objective, when somebody gives up and goes to work every morning, the objective is for them to make money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right, not to pay the employer to for or for an opportunity to drive a truck and then come back with a deficit. And so, again, I'm glad that this issue is front and center. I hope this issue won't go away until we we get to a place where there is some real justice here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, but I will say that this feels a little bit like deja vu, right? Because just a few months ago we were here, we heard the same many of the same testimony. And I'd like to say, like I said, I'd like to think that we are moving in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um, but, you know, just in the last few months, I'm not too encouraged by that. So for, for these workers less than solid and let's continue to move it. I like the fact that we'll have a report back on SB 1402.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I like the fact that we are instructing our city attorney to to look at creative ways for us to to help regulate labor violations. And then I can't say enough for the Port of Long Beach and their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for being here. President Garcia, you I know you care about, you know, the the the port and its place in our city. I would just ask that that your or your organization, your agency, our Port Commission, also continue to work with all the stakeholders to make this right as well.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Law that established that when a municipality is essentially acting in the market and has a contractual relationship for services, they have the right and ability to enter into labor peace agreements. So under that law, it works out just fine at the airport, at the convention center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But at the port there is not that relationship. We do not have we do not hire truckers. Others hire truckers who then come in and serve the people who are hiring them. So we do not have that direct relationship with them.'",

        "'speaker_9': '$70,000 to launch the PRM strategic planning effort. It's not just the budget and but an investment in the direction of the department. PRM will be piloting new innovative ways for enhancing team programing at and Hampton and McBride Parks and $40,000 to launch the strengthening of prime volunteer operations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Since February and even before I started Prime gone to work in the following added contract classes such as karate, basketball, resume writing, interview skills, Zumba, reading and math, enhanced water exercises and ceramic classes in in the past spring and summer season at recreation facilities that had recently not experienced these types of classes.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Continued Arts partnership with the musical Theater West for Youth and Seniors is another example of partnership efforts. Outdoor experience enhancement is important for our youth. And and there's so much more as well. As mentioned previously when I joined Prime, I immediately started exploring parks, beaches and existing social networks around neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I see this type of work as as foundational for the preparation of the launch of a more targeted community engagement effort to develop a vibrant prime strategic plan that will be launched in more in a formal in a more formal way in January.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also thanks to the City Council for supporting a new component in the Prime Department structure to help increase capacity to assess community needs. Grants. Grant Development.

        "'speaker_9': 'Collaboration is an important word, but it's also an important way to work. Not easy, but more long lasting because of the ability to get a larger net of resources to align citywide for greater impact. Not so much an economy of scale as much as an ecology of scale.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is similar to a healthy watershed system helping the flora and fauna of the region. I mention here a lot of our city departments that we're collaborating with, and it is an amazing ecosystem, very similar to the watershed system.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. First and foremost, I really want to thank you, Heraldo, and all of your park staff. I know Stephen, who is interim director. Meredith, who's with you and many of our park and Rec staff members, if we can give them a big round of applause for their work here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm just personally very grateful because this has been a long time coming. And I'm very I just will say very succinctly that I'm very excited about the direction this Park equity item has now taken and evolved into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It started some time ago, and I'm glad we finally got it right, from what I understand and what I'm seeing here. And I really appreciate the effort that has been put in from all of your from yourself being new to the city, but also from your your staff members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, when I brought this forward some time ago, this was not to say who has something, who does not, but it was really just to look at the systemic issue that I feel has been in our park system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it may not be inherently apparent to everybody. But, you know, when we represent some of us represent areas that have a lack of programing, have had a lack of we have more dense neighborhoods and maybe have the same services as everybody else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it looks like a lack of programing oftentimes. And oftentimes it is, especially when you compound that with high poverty rates in some areas and high unemployment rates. So I don't do this because I want to, you know, say one place has something and one place doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just want to detail the fact that this is it's a really important issue. Not only to me, it was I was elected to to do this, but to many of the families and community members who are here today, and I think many of our first district residents for being here from Craftsman and Willmar and North'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Pine and the seniors at the many various places in downtown, I really think them for being here as well as our park commissioners. I've talked in length with many of them, Margot Morales and David Sonata, and I've chatted with Stella, Ursula and Maria La Salgado, who is our first district representative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate them as well as our Karen reside from Partners of Parks. I appreciate the collective input. So a few things I will say about this. I think, again, it's a great step forward. It's a great job that we've done on this report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to add that and I know we have the data analysis that we've we've mentioned, but I just want to point out in terms of data analysis and what we've talked about in the past and where this sort of stemmed from it was the lack of contract classes for a multitude of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we know that the contract classes are based on zip code, from what I understand. And so I'd still like to see and I'm sure you're already looking at this data on resident zip codes so we can see exactly where residents are coming going in our park system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, I attended because I wanted to try it out with my toddler. I went to a park I'm sorry, a cooking class in Eldorado Park. And I asked most of the there were probably about ten families there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I asked the families I said, where are you guys from? Just want to know. They had no idea who I was, right? So I'm like completely blank slate and most of them were from the West Side or central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thinking about Eldorado Park, you're in from West Side, Central Long Beach. Maybe we should have cooking classes there. Or just like I mentioned before, if we have a high unemployment area and a pocket of 90813, which we know city wide has been an issue, maybe we should have resume classes there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know we understand that, which is great and I'm looking forward to seeing that come to fruition. Just some things to highlight before I will ask for support on moving this forward and thinking you again for your work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the department's strategic plan and what we see here and communication, I think are great efforts and I look to continue supporting those efforts to ensure we create a more equitable plan. And not only that, but just talking about equity a bit more, because I think, to be honest, I think you're the first director that's we're laughing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'here. But it's great because you've said both equity and community benefits, which has been a mainstay of this council for some time. So we appreciate that. And the created creativity around positioning park programing as the beneficiary of the coastal zone permitting process, I think that is a really creative way that we could look at in funding gaps'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for programs. Lastly, the Peps program, which I know partnerships which has been big with Council Woman Mango, she's brought up multiple times adopting a park and talking about how do we streamline the process for nonprofits citywide. You know, all of our council districts somewhere along the line, many community organizations are the ones oftentimes activating our parks, whether'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it's yoga classes or whether it's whatever it might be, summer and music classes. Those organizations are doing the work and we have to just decrease the red tape and in issues that they have when they want to come to our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And hold a workshop or conduct these activities. So anything we can do to continue doing that work I'm completely supportive of and I appreciate it's been indicated here in the report. Other than that, I just I look forward to my colleagues questions, ideas, if you'd like to make this more robust.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But again, I think our Parks and Rec staff and are on our team for really moving forward with this. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Congresswoman Gonzalez, Councilman Brice?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I also as Councilmember Gonzalez mentioned, when you said community benefits and when you said equity, I think it just really shows how much we've changed as a city. And the fact that we've talked about it a lot and to have directors talk about it I think is wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Your presentation did a wonderful job about showing the greenspace that is in each area and also how many people live near those areas. So I think that that is that density is a key issue. I want to say that I really like the approach of a one system which I know is challenging with a city of our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'size and highlighting that, yes, we have a cooking class in one area and maybe we need another one in a second area. But also that that conversation around how do we get people down to our sailing classes, you know, how do we look at this as one whole system while also tailoring needs to each area based on'",
        "'speaker_6': 'poverty needs. And so I really appreciate that you have done a job of highlighting every single aspect that comes in contact with our parks from from youth to seniors. And the fact that it is around the resume building is around jobs, it's around creativity and innovation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I was really pleased to see all of those comments throughout this presentation. I am happy, very happy to see that you have on here also a link online for people to donate to our parks system where there's a need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that one of the conversations that I've been wanting to have is around how do we get maybe corporate sponsorship? And I'll start saying we're naming a park after them. But, you know, at Bixby Park, where we have so many needs, we do have corporate sponsors that have said, yeah, we would like to come in like'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Spaulding, and that we don't necessarily have a policy that's in place yet. And I know we haven't taken that up yet, but echoing that with you, I think is really exciting. And I'll just highlight one more time around the memo due process with our friends of the Parks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that this is something that you're going to be looking at in the strategic plan, but for those residents that are watching and listening, having an email you that's most transparent, that we have knowledge and access to who the boards are and understanding how much money are they bringing in and where the needs are so that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we can really be a partner with them to invest in our parks again, are just thrilled to see a presentation on equity from a director that has has jumped in all the way. Really appreciate you very, very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Congresswoman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So in following this conversation on on equity in our city, I want to concur what I've already heard tonight. I'll raise up two things just quickly in this report. I think we have to address systems, so we need geographic diversity on the Parks Commission with North Long Beach and the lack of open space'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, 1.1 acres per 10,000 residents, we have to make sure that that area is represented on our Parks and Recreation Commission. And I know that that right now it's the way our policy is set up. There is no geographic requirement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's not on the commissioners, but it is on us to acknowledge that, you know, systems do contribute to inequities. So that's number one. Number two, as we move forward in this strategy, I think it's smart for you to infuse equity into your your your Parks and rec strategic plan as discussed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I'd like to see some measurable, like tangible measurables that help us understand which needles we're specifically looking to move. How can I take this to my residents and say and boil it down to what this means? Does this mean that we're going to receive more access to contract classes?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Does this mean that we're it's going to be a more equitable distribution of, you know, resources to develop more open space opportunities? Does this mean that we're going to, you know, direct our work to identifying grants and resources to move the needle a bit?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what we want to understand. What are some tangible things that we can, some tangible measurements that we can track as we move forward. But that said, I think this is really important work. I think Councilwoman Gonzalez and everyone who's been a part of this conversation and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our staff in the office equity. And I look forward to future iterations of what's to come. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next counts among all players.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I want to thank the Parks Rec team for all their work on this. I know that you guys have spent a considerable amount of time over the last few weeks. I appreciate the number of meetings that you've been willing to have with me and my residents and the friends of groups.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A couple of things. I appreciate the need for additional park space. It's always great to do that. I think that as we bring that park space online, we have to talk about where is the money to maintain it come from.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because what we have not done is maintain our parks. And one of the things that I want to make sure is measurable in our strategic plan is what is the level of park system of maintenance that we expect to deliver to our community?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because what we don't want to do is just have a new park of the week. And then right now everyone from all over the city is rushing to the eighth District because they have the coolest new park. But as that park gets desegregated over time, what funds are available to make sure that it's maintained?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are lots of mechanisms in place for starting new parks. There's a fund for that. But as you do that, if your park abatements budget is X and you've added. 20% more parks and you haven't added 20% more maintenance funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you have a. A drought and now you need 30% more water. That's where we ended up last year. And so I don't want to see us in those positions. I think we need to start thinking about reserves for our parks as well, so that in certain years, as we have good years of there's lots of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'water that perhaps we set somebody aside that could only be used in a year that has a drought year or things like that. Then finally, I just want to say that. The communication is a huge part of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What Councilman Gonzales mentioned is something that I've known since the first month I was on the job when I was elected in June of 2014. I quickly was invited to pop water and soccer and all the different groups.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a majority of the kids in the programs on the East Side are not from the east side, but a majority of the park space is on the east side, so people have to commute to get there. We have to do a much better job of linking our parks through our our bus system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that when my brother was was a youth, he was actively a part of the bus system. And that wasn't something that my mom learned about until my parents got divorced. And we had to be able to move around the city and get to soccer practice and get to these places.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And now I was a kid learning the bus system and. A lot of the routes are not conducive to getting the people where they need to go. They're conducive to maybe getting people to the jobs they have, which is great and important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we have to talk about all three levels of systems. If all the seniors live here and all the senior program, be this here, we either need to move the senior programing and then communicate that to the people because a lot of where people know where to enroll comes from tradition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So often I was talking to the North Long Beach Pap Water Group. I help them fundraise that I go to their events and they've always practiced in El Dorado Park, even though they're the North Long Beach Pap Water Group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so they came to me and said, we need better maintenance of these parks because this is where we're practicing. The parks on our side of town are actually in better condition. But the the tradition of where you get your park permit has been the tradition for so long.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your first right of refusal of the certain fields is what it is. And so we have to talk about that. And most importantly, we need to talk about rest. We need to have passive park, space and park rest regularly because the playability of parks over time is segregated by the amount of use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that you've addressed all of these in your park plan. I look forward to continuing to support resources. And then just as a final component to Councilman Pearce has called it, the Pep's program is for sponsorship.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if Spaulding wants to do that now, that is available. The policy was passed by this council 18 to 24 months ago. We just need to have that person on board who will work with Poppy, the Parks Rec Department in the commission, and kind of facilitate it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if there's a contact person at a specific park in mind, I know that a couple of them have bubbled up, but they just haven't made it to the forefront. And so I think that those times are here and now and and I think that as we talk about what these things cost, similar to the way in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'which you can do something at the library, you should absolutely be able to name a soccer field or a baseball field for a designated amount of time. For a designated amount of money. And that money should be proportional to what it costs to maintain it at a level that you'd want your team name on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And an example of that is right now, the Kings are going to be refurbishing a space for us in the city, and we're very lucky for that. But the Kings to put their name on something, what's a certain level of a field?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to be paid for the resurfacing to do that, and we need more and more partners to be able to step up and do that. Target has been producing lots of commercials about it online. Get on the phone, call Target and tell them we want a soccer field named after Target and we want them to refurbish'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it. Long Beach, because those are creative ways to continue to support our park programs. So once again, thank you to our commissioners. Thank you to our staff, thank you to our management team. And I really appreciate this moving forward and the extensive effort that's been put in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Mungo comes when I say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much and thank you of Mr. Mowat for a very comprehensive presentation. I think this is this is great work and we certainly I think we're taking steps in the right direction. I, for one, appreciate how this conversation has evolved about park equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Didn't start out so, so civil. I was it was a lot of uncertainty around it. But like I said, I'm glad that we're headed in the right direction in terms of the decorum as well as is the approach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think this is a this is a comprehensive approach that takes into consideration just about everything I to represent a district at a programing. It was evident and made evident in the last of Parks Recreation, a marine report on on equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I still have a great deal of poverty in my district and particularly in North Long Beach communities. And however, I'm very thankful of the strides that have been made recently. To add greenspace in North Long Beach, dozens of acres of greenspace and investment in parks upgrades in the district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that that also needs to be balanced out and considered. You know, we talk about new parks, we talk about green space. You know, not not every park needs to be programed. And I recognize that I said it here before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, there are parks that we have that, you know, if you try to program them, you're going to have a problem with the neighbors. You know, so one size doesn't necessarily fit all here. And so I do give a great deal of discretion and credence to the professionals who are who run our parks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The last time I checked and I will say this, our parks are still winning. Our Parks Recreation Marine Department is still winning awards on a national level for the delivery of services on and on and on again. And that's because we have awesome partners.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I love the fact that we are talking about, you know, continuing to build and leverage the partnerships that we have, partners of parks. I know there's some some exciting things happening with that data support organization. And I saw something here that really jumped out at me looking at partners, partnering with Colombia's unified school district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that is certainly in line with the the the aims, the goals of this this this council, as we have recently, you know, we generated the Joint Use Committee with Long Beach Unified. And we'll certainly be discussing these items on the agenda, you know, with with the with our Long Beach Unified Partners as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think engaging neighborhood groups and adopting parks is is right where we need to be. And and making sure, like you said, this comprehensive approach engages everybody and takes into account and to our entire population, including, of course, most importantly, our youth, but but also our senior citizens who who contribute so greatly to the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm actually looking forward to this. As I understand it, this is a strategic approach. This is a beginning, right, of a process that will will engage several community stakeholders and partners. And a plan will come back to us at a later date.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. Thank you very much. I just wanted to make sure we were clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Councilman. I assume Councilman Supra, now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And to staff, thank you for an excellent report. Really enjoyed it. The only downside was the fourth district parks were included in it. So I'd like to make a request right now, and that is if you want to just deliver it from the fourth District Office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is I'd like to see a crunched the numbers on AWS of a park the corner of 14th and Zaba. I think those.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Density numbers will probably rival MacArthur Park. 90804 is one of the most.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dense areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I mentioned that because. When the numbers get that high and then you have a part that is challenged with access.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because of any variety of issues, then it's a double whammy. Then you have more people not being able to get to that park. So I would like to kind of address things that that very basic level. We had a situation at Whaley Park.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When Cal State Long Beach changed their parking policy for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Freshmen. Suddenly, the students.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Parked all around the park 24 seven over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The weekend and everything, and suddenly not only the neighbors couldn't get to the park, but we talk about that factor of people coming from the west side or the east side, and there was no place to park. Very simple solution we put into our parking bingo in a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm looking at for some simple solutions where we have issues that are preventing the neighbors from utilizing the park. And I would love to see.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'PRM involved in that process. We have PD, we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have homeless outreach. We have the city prosecutor's office. But really, PRM is kind of the eyes and ears right there. You have staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There all the time, and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know I'm a little bit off topic here, but the greatest equity programs in the world are of no use if if the residents don't have access to the park. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Miranda.'",

I recall not too long ago where I say you got to stop using the term that you're new to the city, where this report right here shows that you've really'",
        "'speaker_8': 'made a great effort to go out and see all our parks, make a quick assessment, and determine what needs to be done to ensure that there's equity and equality in all our parks. I'm especially pleased to see that you're looking at creating more opportunities for contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Contract programs in parks especially are lacking in some of those and some of those areas, such as dance or even the resume writing. So it's it's comprehensive. I'm very glad to see that you jumped right in and you go in hard and and you came up with a report that I think we all can be very, very'",
        "'speaker_8': 'happy to see because you're headed in the right direction. I think all the comments that I've heard so far from my colleagues is that this is going in a direction that we need to see. Well, one point that I that I missed here earlier and it's fairly new, I guess, and it'll be, I guess, in future reports'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we're looking at at a new park, if you will, to be activated. Will Springs Park. That's still evolving, as we know, and we're still trying to look at ways to get a a community resource center there, or at least to a reception center there so that people can know what the what the park is all about, its'",
        "'speaker_8': 'history and and what's available there and walking paths and all that. So, I mean, hopefully in another report, we can look at Will Springs and include that in in this area here, because it's greenspace and it's another opportunity for our residents to enjoy open space.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Nature walks, as well as being able to learn a little bit more about the history of Long Beach and why it's called Willow Springs Park. It's a very little known fact there. So I see that we have some members of the Parks Recreation Commission here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Welcome. Glad to see you here. And that shows our support that you have with our Parks, Recreation and Marine Department and the people who work there. And I see that some of the staff is still here. Of course, they probably need to be here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They have to be here to support the director, but that's neither here nor there. But I'm glad to see that you're all here to support this item and to support this report, because I think it's obviously one that's headed in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we this is not something that we're going to shelve. I think this needs to be a live document or a living document like this is a terminal we need to use so that it could evolve and and change as we move along and make those changes into our park system to make sure that we address all'",
        "'speaker_8': 'our needs in the communities. And you're absolutely right. That comes from basically what we were taught. We're about access. And that's that's a big issue with me everywhere and everything that I've done that I do. It's about making sure that our communities have access to all the opportunities that we offer here in the city of Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So thank you, Mr. Watt, for this report and I'm looking forward to working with you even further as we go, as we move along.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Congressman. Uranium. Councilman, Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought it was great that one of my colleagues mentioned how aware our new director is of the parks. If you don't already follow him on Facebook and you have not been to all of our parks on a regular basis, he is at a park taking photos of the park, participating in or talking to participants at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'parks. I've lived here almost my whole life. That was a quick exception to go away to college and I've been to all of our parks over time, but in such a short amount of time for you to have been to so many parks is very impressive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then to follow up on something Austin said about the Joint Use Committee, I would love to see us get to a place where Long Beach Unified and the City have a better access policy. I know that right now there's differences between pools and fields and there's lots of opportunities where the principals have the discretion there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oddly, Park Reservation system is very their online field reservation system is very different than ours. There's no congruency. And so what happens now is we allocate fields based on. A formula and that their allocation of fields is not based on a formula.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so there are winners and losers that we could really prevent if we had a better relationship. And I know that part of the relationships challenge is our on our side related to timing, because the timing of how many fields are needed is based on the timing of when the enrollments are, which really doesn't give us a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'lot of communication opportunities in that short little window between when we find out how many kids are in each program and when the season starts. And so for that, I look forward to any opportunities and solutions that I know Long Beach is ready and willing to be supportive of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understanding that principals change and move regularly. And so that's part of the the complexity of it all. And same with our, our our sister sports system commissioners change regularly as well. So thank you to everyone. Great presentation. And again, thank you, everyone for being here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Councilman Michael, I first of all, I'd like to just say I'd like to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez to bring this item forward, because in a lot of our communities, our parks are a lifeline. And I just can find that, you know, this is where you go to gather and find out how to get together'",
        "'speaker_1': ', come together. And this is what's so important about, you know, our new director here, he and his staff. You guys are very, very hard workers. And I say once this was brought forward, this you he just went all out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to thank you, because the first time I met this individual, you know, I met him at Vets Park and, you know, and the residents. So I felt even though there was a lot of work to do, I knew we were in the right direction because I'm looking forward to a masterplan citywide for MacArthur's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Park, which we've had many conversations about. And I just want to thank you for getting on top of these things so fast. And and you and your staff, you guys are really wonderful. And I want to thank you guys for being so hard, such hard workers and working with the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have so many parks and you have such a large responsibility. But thank you again for being so supportive. And with that, the web and the community, I mean by coming.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Certainly is a great presentation. The one picture you had up there that showed and I realize it was designed prior to you being there is that building makes sure that is high definition in this case me. But make sure it's an ADA accessible period.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also, it would be best to advise people relative to the waterfront areas. Remember that you do not fish off the company pier. Some people fail to understand that. Even some. Council members had also their full array of services offered by the commendable Parks Department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Psychiatric care is not one of them. So if you if one has some psychiatric problems or if you have a friend that knows one. If you have a friend that needs it, recommend they go and take it to the Health Department.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A park facility is no more appropriate than that, than a city council seat being used to tell, you know, somebody to impart their tale of woe and so forth. But overall, absolutely tremendous job and the presentation. And again, given the short time that you've been here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker.'",

I am the co-chair of Craftsman Village Historic District, and I'm here tonight to speak about park equity for our neighborhood and for all the other neighborhoods in our city that have been underserved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our little park, Craftsman Village Park, was a dream of our neighborhood about ten years ago. The residents of Pressman Village worked together with our first district council member, who was Bonnie Lowenthal at the time, and then Robert Garcia, and then finally Lena Gonzales and the Parks Recreation Department to create a beautiful park, a park for our neighbors'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to enjoy. With a very robust effort by parks in writing grants to help fund the project, our park was completed in 2013. For the last two summers, we have been very fortunate to have the financial support of Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She provided our park with a summer recreation program for children ages 5 to 12. In addition to this, she partnered with our historic district this summer to provide a movie in the park for all of us to enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much to our surprise and amazement. We had a very large turnout for this event. Over 110 residents enjoyed a movie under the stars. Families gathered shared company and camaraderie. Create creating a bond that will continue. And I want to go off script just for a moment and say that our last Craftsman Village historic district meeting, we had'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a record turnout of 30 plus people. And I really feel it's due to the fact that we had that beautiful evening that night, and it brought out more people to that meeting. So it really does have a lasting effect, the effect that continues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez provided the funding for the permit for this movie in the park and the insurance. And one of our residents completely donated all of his equipment and expertize to make this a night of pure magic. Gladys Kiser from Parkes helped with the logistics a little bit and we were all set.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Overwhelmingly, our residents asked for another such event and regular programing at our park. We are asking our council to support specifically programing at Craftsman Village Park, a regular summer recreation program for our youth, and two movie nights next summer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More broadly, Craftsman Village supports other neighborhoods all across Long Beach who who deserve equal access to a recreation program. Thank you all and goodnight.'",

And I really appreciate that. I would also commend the Council and what you're doing with partnering with local nonprofits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that there's a pool of money out there with different grants that can be reached. And if we can work together, we can help offset some of the costs that the parks are having. Also recently, I am now a card carrying AARP member and I would goldthorpe i would like to see more of senior activities at'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City council, I think that his work and his commitment in such a short period of time is really amazing. It is certainly something I would never have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Expected in the past.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm very surprised and very gratified. I appreciate Councilwoman Gonzales for bringing forth the Park Equity Challenge, and I look forward to working with park staff in improving things. I do not have children here. Most of our board do not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we recognize the importance of our parks for our youth and that they are involved and have access when they can get in trouble, that there's someplace for them to go. So that's really one of our primary concerns, is that they have things that will assist them in getting jobs and entertaining them and keeping them out of'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And I've met neighbors, staff and I enjoy building community there. I've really fallen in love with Cesar Chavez and I can see how important this park is to our neighborhood. The community center is a treasure, but it suffers from what most of our parks, city parks have or experienced broken equipment, lack of maintenance and a lack of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'programing, services, understaffing being closed on the weekends, a lack of bathroom on weekends, and no recycling program. Our neighborhood is experiencing rapid increases in population without park space that's so badly needed. But we have a rich network of parks in our city that can provide green time for all of Long Beach.'",

I believe this Council has taken the steps in the right, have taken steps in the right direction to open up more'",
        "'speaker_4': 'parks and renovate existing ones. However, the reality is that we are a long way from reversing the devastating impacts of discriminatory policies like redlining.

        "'speaker_4': 'today and roughly 85% predominantly white. When putting this into perspective, it is quite alarming to see that from the 2017 Park Equity Report, we continue to see that examples of redlining, maybe it's a stretch, but that some communities are being less invested in than in others.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Furthermore, community based organizations like Margaux's In Action and other smaller community based organizations working to access spaces at our parks can be extremely difficult given the burden of costs we often have to carry, in addition to oftentimes the million dollar insurance policies that are required to reserve space at parks, creating barriers to increase our engagement and service'",

It's a community where everyone is safe, connected and healthy. I really appreciate the leadership of Councilwoman Gonzalez in bringing this item forward initially and continuing this work, as well as the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'new leadership of our Parks Director taking this on and really reflecting the conversation. I'd also like to encourage a strong collaboration with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Equity. As you continue this work and really tonight, I want to encourage us to keep the spirit of the original item going throughout this conversation'",
        "'speaker_2': '. In that initial presentation, we saw the disparities in the contract classes. We saw the disparity where you have high rates of unemployment and one in the central area of Long Beach in particular, and other areas in the city, but all the adult enrichment classes being held at Eldorado Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's really important. I think density is one way of looking at that, who's served, what the needs are. But we really need to keep these other kind of indicators, whether it's the the areas in terms of the zip code, what the employment rate and access to other opportunities are in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And really just to stick to the intention of this item, another important one being streamlining the process, reducing the red tape for community organizations to activate parks and to be involved in the planning process. I was really happy to see items like community engagement and language access as priorities in the Parks Strategic Plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I've just seen so many examples, whether it be at MLK Park, MacArthur Park, Admiral Kidd, where there are community residents who are really wanting to make changes and activate those spaces and coming up with a lot of barriers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so community involvement is very important to make sure that this is part of our process moving forward. Additionally, our organization worked with others to support. We do a lot of community events and I know in one particular instance and there have been several others where we were trying to hold a workshop at a park space and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the cost was so prohibitive that we ended up, you know, using a church with no air conditioning in the middle of the summer. It was still packed, but it was not very comfortable. So it's really important that we have programing that's relevant, that's dispersed throughout the community, and we really need to keep the focus on equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to see numbers about how we're really moving the needle in this conversation. Councilmember Richardson took the words right out of my mouth. We need to make sure that we're staying focused on how we're actually making change around equity in our city.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'There's and I second some of what said here, there's a lot of opportunity here to leverage relationships. Like I saw Long Beach Unified School District. One of the things I always noticed is how come our students are kids don't know about the great things that are happening at the park and community partners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some of the folks that have spoken here and build relationships to increase access to our park system and provide educational opportunities and programing to our children. I look forward as Commissioner to supporting an increase in inclusive, safe and accessible infrastructures within our parks to its residents and in my opinion, more importantly, our children.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I work almost every day with the dedicated park staff. I have never seen staff give so much to our community and be so unrecognized. Lena, thank you for bringing this forward. Parks are such a vital part of our community and we need more of them and we need more activities, particularly in the low income neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to reiterate the fee barriers and also parks. We pay taxes on our parks. We all do. We all support our parks. So asking for fees on top of it sometimes, as Christine mentioned, through the work I do with the Long Beach Gray Panthers, sometimes that's a barrier, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's it's not just within the community. It's with our groups and bringing our communities together. So I want to mention those things and please include teams in the planning process for their particular programs.

        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to add, I can't resist bringing this up when I hear about. Economic inequalities, and I think especially given the history within Long Beach of economic segregation. I like to remind if we're worried about money money echoing counter one Mungo's comment and also Councilmember Joe Rubinoff that the parks can be as great as they can be'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But if we don't have access or if we don't have money to continue maintaining them, then it almost it's going to make the efforts twice as hard for us if we're interested in funding. I just like to bring this up because it's kind of my pet issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we know, certain parts of Long Beach in which the parks are better will by and large have higher property values as we make improvements to our parks. It is statistically very likely that property values in the surrounding area will go up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This could sadly, ironically, work to price people out of the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Areas that parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are in. This has happened with gentrification and other issues like that. So I would encourage the city to continue to look into finding a way to capture the value that reify itself in property values as parks become more valuable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is public investment, public money. Parks belong to the public, but the money ends up in the private pockets of landowners through rent. So there is ways to catch this. The Belmont Shore area already does this with its parking, for example, and there are ways to get around Prop 13 with catchment areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would encourage Long Beach to continue looking into that. This is probably not the best forum for me to bring that up. I should probably actually attend a, you know, Parks meeting one day and just sort of talk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just wanted to take the time to say that. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss. Councilwoman Munger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I wanted to address two additional items that were a part of the discussion tonight. One of the things that was talked about was fees. And I know that as a big part of what's going on in Parks and Rec, we're doing a fee study in 2015 after being elected to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I specifically asked Finance Department for in future bringing forward our fees to state what is the cost of what we're providing, what is the cost that we are charging to the participant and that a column to show the subvention.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So an example might be we allow sometime in the summer for a dollar per child, but the cost to run a pool at 250 children a day is actually closer to $12 a child. And so that subvention rate would be one I'm sorry, one over 12.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just figuring out what that looks like, because I think that one of the things that we often forget is the costs associated with that. And so I think that across the board, there might be things that we've been subjected that maybe we didn't want to add, other things that we think we should be.'",
        "'speaker_2': '17 And I think that that's where where the core of the question comes from. And then we talked a little bit about metered said recycling programs, that additional park programs that could be available at different parks. If you have park programs or specific contract classes that you're interested in and you have a specific group of individuals where'",
        "'speaker_2': 'you can say, I know that if you give yoga in this park, we'll get 12 participants. That's really where we've had the success with some of our contract classes. The instructors are always very eager if they know they can get the participant levels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so if you are already having those meetings in your community and you know which specific classes those are reticent email, please feel free to call. I have a lot of contact with a lot of the instructors because a lot of them already teach at Eldorado Park, so they reach out to me quite often.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They are looking to add a second park, but they don't really have a gauge or understanding of which park should be that second park. And making those choices can often be bad business decisions because if the community that that gets yoga is actually the community that wanted resums, then they have a class with two participants that they'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We've been running the company for about seven years now and have really transformed the company into from an advertising based model to a true transportation mobility solution that we've applied again across the country in different cities through different partnerships and relationships with those municipalities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is pretty much our system in one slide. What we need to do is provide fleets of fully 100% electric shuttles. We do that at no cost to the rider, and we also do that through fully W-2 employees that are the drivers of the shuttles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the idea of the system is to innovate and really solve the last mile gap. That's been a been a constant issue in cities around the world, especially here in California and New York, where I'm from and where Daniel's from, Long Beach here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The goal always is to create a system that fits the city's needs. No city is one size fits all. We have a service that we like to consider interchangeable and adaptable and flexible to each city into and to their needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think what this slide shows and what was great to see here is that every item tonight seemed to connect to this on one level or another, whether it's access, employment, parking issues, environmental issues, getting people to and from where they need to be if these programs and cities programs exist from there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What we try to do beyond what the system does is when we come in, we like to be flexible. Let's start in phases. We start with the pilot in Long Beach, which we'll get into in a second. But the flexibility is what really allows the system to kind of, you know, take on a life of itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can adjust the level of service income incrementally, which reduces our costs and makes it run more efficiently. And our job is to really have the least amount of cars on the road at the at the at the least amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our next thing we want to complement existing and other forms of transportation. There's no one size fits all transportation solution for a city. There's many different needs by many different people, and from residents to workers to visitors. What we need to do is become multi-modal and complement those other forms of existing transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's at the core of what we do and really is what drives its success. It's really our niche to fill that last mile gap that others can't or they shouldn't, and it's more efficient for it to be done with a smaller electric vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The only thing we're trying to replace is single occupancy vehicles. Everything else is a is a compliment and should be put into the same system. Reduction is the obvious one. We're here to reduce emissions congestion, single occupancy vehicles and vehicle miles traveled, which are the main factors in pollution and congestion problems down the country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Data driven technology. So we use an app. You can have the car multiple different ways, but it's all tracked by the driver through a mobile application. We can then use that data to see how people are moving historically and in real time when they're moving, where they're moving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we can adapt the system to kind of learn as it goes and become smart and not only to run most efficiently, but move the most people. The real time solution is the bottom line. It's here. We ran the pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It exists. You know, we're there's plenty of time and ideas and stuff to work into the system, including autonomous vehicles and the such. But right now we've run a fully electric shuttle service that is a last mile solution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we can look at some of the data here from the pilot program to show its success. A few pictures here. So we ran a pilot for eight weeks. And a little bit of background on that is, as Councilwoman Pierce said, we started from the beginning of the year discussing with herself and public works on how to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'make this happen. We landed on, for budget reasons, eight week pilot with eight vehicles. And this is kind of the result. The only thing to mention here is that we actually launched in one week. Usually we require 90 days to launch a system and we launched this all in one week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's where you'll see on the first step there about riders, the tremendous jump from the first four weeks to the second four weeks. You learn the system. We train, staff, the drivers. It's a very much a living system that learns on itself and only gets more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with time, we could see those numbers go up. So again, in May, in the last four weeks of the programs, we gave about 11,500 riders. Wait time was five minute, 14 seconds. The 17 jobs created again are full W-2 employees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And depending on the situation, it ranges from, you know, our average is about $15 per hour. You can see the emission reduce that and that's based on mileage and people driven. The increase in ridership, again, shows the trend and what it can do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We haven't even seen its potential eight weeks where a pilot is is is a pretty big feat. Most pilots we run are six months to a year and you'd only see that number grow at the same amount of assets in the same manner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Expenses. The five star rating I want to throw in there, what I really saw on Long Beach was to see in another couple slides, which I'm not from here, but I don't have to tell anybody here, should be proud of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've never seen a community react to a system like it was their own and they were part of it. And it was really cool to see the feedback like we've never seen before. And even people, you know, when we launch coming up to a street, just wondering what it is happy it's there just it was real community'",
        "'speaker_4': 'feel more than other cities I've walked into so it's good to see this is you know in quick what we learned we can expand the coverage area we currently we started in that was again for the pilot program see where it left off and to learn from it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In our experience, that's also the best way to grow it, start incrementally and grow it to where it should be and grow it how it should grow rather than guessing what's going to happen. The trends in that ridership and in support show they can only grow and become more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And from the data and what we'll run through here is definitely used by by all parties in the city. We have a ton of traffic from the hotels, but just as much of of people reaching out now asking where it went.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I live downtown and how I don't have a car or I can't ride a scooter or, you know, it's it's part of that system. And I think we really noticed that in the pilot. This is some of the feedback.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll go through these quick. This is from the app feedback just straight from the app, from the rider. No surveys or anything from us. It was again, this is really where we saw probably 50% more response rate than in any other city that we were in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And most of it was either suggestions as the bottom rate to expand a couple of blocks or to show their support. And there's more of this. There's hundreds more of these, but just want to show some of them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then after email feedback, I know we were pointing that to public works at the time because we ran through it, but we received a lot of phone calls and email support as well. This is part of the dashboard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you can see, the the this is our internal proprietary dashboard. We run these heat maps based on different times of the day, the month, all of those good metrics and then from a pickup point of view and a data and I've drop off my view.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is pick ups, obviously. I wish this was an actual computer screen so I could zoom in and show you where, but you get the idea of where the heavy traffic is and then drop off close to the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You see a lot more spread out and drop off. Usually people centralized pickups and spread out drop offs. But again, all data we can report and makes the system stronger and also shows who's using it, who's benefiting it from it, what stakeholders should be involved in the program on top of a public works or another funding source'",
        "'speaker_4': '. The press that comes with it. It's a it's a free electric shuttle service. It tends to line up well with press and hopefully positive press at that. This is Long Beach. It was $100,000 for eight cars for a two month pilot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, that was kind of I mean, it was actually just under that. But we rounded up the goal was to first start with Grand Prix and launch for that, and that's why we launched in a week. But from there, really show the range in the system from when different events are in town and to when it's really'",
        "'speaker_4': 'just a regular Tuesday, when it's more of a resident and workers of the city type shuttle. The results which we saw the other piece to think about this and that I didn't mention is a lot of times we as a company, we set up a relationship with a municipality, whether that's through a city, CVB traveling, tourism, convention'",
        "'speaker_4': 'center directly, hotels, whatever group it is, business improvement district, downtown associations. We set up that relationship to see where the needs are. Try to execute on that and get some secured funding in place in order to roll out the program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we use the program's kind of benefits to then hopefully and over time reduce the net cost of the system to the original funding party. We do that through advertising. We also do that through the efficiencies of the program as well as the constant building on the technology, as well as the staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For example, here in San Diego, we've running for two years now and we're every month we. Of ridership to date. And that's all with the same amount of vehicles. Speaking of San Diego, that looking at different ways, we have partnered with cities in the most successful ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This was a public private partnership in its truest sense. Civic San Diego is a public organization that handles the parking meter revenue from the downtown community parking districts. There's very defined geographic borders there. And since our funding is from there, that is the geographic border of the coverage area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that came through an RFP in San Diego. They were looking at a traditional trolley system, but to move people short distances in a congested downtown area, they did had a few consultant studies tell them that just didn't make sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The cost of it, the infrastructure, the size of the vehicles, all of that good stuff's. We ended up winning the RFP. That was two years ago. We want a couple of awards. Since then, we've extended the program and it's really shown its value.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the biggest things that we didn't see going into it, this was a transportation system for the residents, residents first and workers and then visitors of the area. And that's what we focused on. The biggest thing we saw was the increased utilization of the service from the transit hubs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if you've been down San Diego on the Amtrak or the coaster. You come in on the west side of the city, getting to the rest of the city, besides support from there is is a walk or a taxi or an Uber.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've seen a lot of increased utilization of that for different reasons to go to to go to work, to go to ballgames, all of that good stuff. Same thing from the MTS trolley lines. And we work hand in hand with them in order to make sure we're complementing them and really focusing our efforts on where their'",
        "'speaker_4': 'transit deserts are, so to speak. And again, that revenue and the money for the system is from the parking meter revenue in the downtown area. Recently we got approved to move that uptown and expand the entire system from downtown to uptown, using the same funds just from the Uptown Community Park District.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the other side, but same, you know, general idea of service in Santa monica. We work with Santa monica Travel and Tourism, which was previously the Convention and Visitors Bureau. This is more focused on the hotels and the visitors of the area first, residents second, and we're working to expand that with the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the program with City is an annual contract. It's from the time assessment funding that they receive. And from there we have each hotel which you'll see on the top of that, which who wants to participate in the program, can sponsor their own vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've grown that from three cars to eight cars over the past two years, and we continue to have more demand. And it's been a huge, huge success for them in this case. What they wanted with their program is to have destination general destination branding on the vehicles so we don't sell much advertising, but on the back boxes'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a little bit different. So we don't share that that revenue with them. But this is this is where their funding goes. So they own the vehicle and they can do what they please with it. So that was the other way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They've also won awards for the best new idea, which is a pretty general category, but I think a good one. And we've also again keep growing that service. In West Palm Beach. We've also worked with the Downtown Development Authority, which runs a complimentary trolley system in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We use our vehicles. They co-branded just on a regular advertising contract in order to increase the mobility in the area. And that's it. I think from here that what our job to do is we saw the mobility solution work in Long Beach and we wanted to bring it back and bring it back for the long term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's our job to do that and find the funding to do that, and that's why we're here to ask for your help in doing that. And, you know, our goal and Daniel over the past couple of months as well as going forward is to really identify the stakeholders in the city that we can draw those funds to'",
        "'speaker_4': '. What our plan is to do. And what we need to do is create one system. Whether that's involving different groups and their different goals is is only more beneficial to us. But making it one cohesive system is really the goal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Go ahead. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. You can go ahead. I really appreciate the presentation. I wanted to make sure that all of our council members had the same information that I had. As we move forward in this discussion, I think I also want to let folks know that at the very beginning we had the CVB as a part of the conversation as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'well. And so I think trying to work with the CVB and the hotels, at least in downtown, but I've heard a lot of requests from other areas of the city, which is why we wanted to bring it to a public conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, just for the record, I hope to receive and file this today and then to have a fuller conversation on the second week in November at the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, where we can engage with some of those other stakeholders and continue the conversation around how do we have a solution to that last mile?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilwoman Price. Thank you. I, too, want to thank you for the presentation when this project was first rolled out in downtown. I contacted the city manager and I think our mayor at the time and said, this is fantastic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I really want this in the Belmont Shore area. So I'm glad that Eric and John are here. I really think there's an opportunity for us to think about utilizing the service to connect Belmont Shore to Alamitos Bay, especially with Second and PCH coming and we've got Ballast Point and Boathouse on the bay and all those businesses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we had a system like this in place, we can keep keep the transportation corridor, the primary transportation corridor, a second street, and avoid going up and down the residential streets, which has been a major concern for residents who live on some of those densely parking impact, densely populated parking impacted streets where they don't want any'",
        "'speaker_5': 'transit vehicles going through it. We could just keep it on Second Street and go back and forth between the shore and second and PCH. I think if there's a way and I know that's one of the things and I think Council Member Pearce for bringing this forward and for allowing us to put some language in there that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'says let's look at whether or not we could use some of the money from some of the self-assessments that we have or some of the meter money that is collected in those areas to put towards a program like this gentleman, Gabriella Yates from my office is going to come and give you my card, if you wouldn't mind'",
        "'speaker_5': 'reaching out to me via email tonight or tomorrow, I would like the two of you, if you're okay with it, to present to the Belmont Shore Parking Commission about this program. They've been looking for an idea like this for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, Eric, is that okay with you if they come and present to the Belmont Shore Parking Commission about what this concept is? Because really that would be a partner that would have to have some skin in the game if we're going to move forward with a concept like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I love it. I think it's great. And I think, you know, we're going to have. Thousands of new spots created in terms of parking with the development of Second and PCH and the reconfiguration of Marina. There's a real opportunity to have that be the parking center and have people just be able to leave their cars there'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and go back and forth using transportation like this and keep Belmont Shore active and thriving as a experiential corridor. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm really appreciative that this is going to go to the Transportation Committee. I think that's a great place for it to start. I think that. By Boccia over the next few weeks, the last few weeks said to be consistent with that, making sure we know what we're talking about, feasibility studies at all of those things, what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they cost. But I tell a huge supporter of this, just in looking at Douglas Park and the number of individuals who wish they could get on scooters and or bicycles to get to and from either Doris Way, our newly improved and more traditional business corridor or to Long Beach Exchange and the number of businesses that have six'",
        "'speaker_2': 'or more people who are all going there at the same time to be able to coordinate large pickups and drop offs because the parkade is already just at capacity. You not get into Jersey Lakes, you not get into California Fish Grill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're literally waiting for a parking spot for 15 minutes. And so some of those businesses could have more business if we had a trams like this. And I see either a luggage exchange management company or any of those businesses looking to be sponsors on the sides of the vehicles to be able to provide that funding.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Otherwise we'd have to go all the way to the 20th. So we'll work with you on that date. Also, just one question, general destination branding. Would that include like a phrase like go forth? I'm just just going to.'",
