        "'speaker_3': 'But I think it succinctly captures the essence of where the city city's going. And it's the collaboration with Powell and all the other arts communities and the downtown. And we're we're now being recognized. In addition, our team worked very closely with the convention center staff to bring the Longines Master Equestrian Competition, which was two weekends ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's Paris, it's Hong Kong, and it's Long Beach, actually, L.A. But we say Long Beach and and with that, it's kind of like the Grand Slam of tennis, where if you win all three, you collect a purse of $5 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we had horses that were flown in from Belgium, and they had to have 48 hour quarantines and people and space outfits because they couldn't touch them. And actually, when they left, they left two horses behind for us.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So the readers of these publications got to see Long Beach as a summer destination, which ran through April through July. But our bread and butter still as a community is our convention business. And it's a continued investment into the convention center that continues to reap the dividends that we've been enjoying as a city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with our turnkey facility. You'll see what our customers have to say is right there and it's all walkable. You can walk to everything entertainment, shopping, amazing food. It's just one big ball of energy and a lot of fun.'",

Having gone there for the Longines tournament and seeing how that space was completely transformed was incredible. And also just walking around the area and seeing a different group of folks there enjoying the property and enjoying the event was impressive to me'",

I don't know how many people have been there recently. The staff really seems to enjoy working there and it makes you excited to be there at the event, and I've really only seen that here in'",

I love hearing about it because then the next week and I'm probably at the Convention Center seeing this glorious thing.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we believe that this is going to be a team effort, but because the consultant team, which consists of Jacobs Engineering Group, as well as a number of sub consultants, they took fairly deep dives in some technical areas that they're in the best position to present that information at the study sessions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff will be available as well to help answer any additional questions. But we do believe that there's a benefit to having the the consultant team present the findings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I guess I need to get some details. How many members of the consultant team do we expect to have present? I mean, because it's it breaks down to $10,000 a meeting and that's just seems a little bit excessive in this regard.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Well, just to be clear, the while there are team members who will be participating in preparing for the study sessions, we and we will have only two members from the Jacobs team in attendance and one principally who will be in charge of presenting the material.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it will take an amount of time to prepare for it, to ensure that the presentation itself is is very solid and thorough. And for that reason, that's what we have budgeted, the amount that we have for the two meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Mr. Romo, ultimately, I would hope that we are in a position that our staff and our city attorneys are capable of and qualified to answer questions regarding this feasibility study, because the feasibility study, I believe, was actually developed for our city, not for Jacobs engineering, to continue to to to make make money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's a statement more than anything. And so and I guess the question is, do you feel that this is this expenditure is necessary for these two meetings?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe that it is for these two meetings. I think, again, a lot of work has gone into this, as everybody knows, over a series of several months. We believe that having the team from Jacobs be part of preparing it and then executing it at the next two study sessions would be of benefit and a value for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the city, for the constituents that I think want to hear about the feasibility study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So will Jacobs engineering be on hand when they come back to make and when this issue comes back to the city council?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's part of what is covered in the base contract, the precise or the exact nature of how will be presented. I believe that there will be a stronger, greater presence of staff in in presenting the report to council in November.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, I'll just make my comments. It just doesn't seems excessive that we have to go through to 30 sessions and incur extra cost where I think we do have staff expertize as well as city attorney expertize. The city attorney I've been reading the the feasibility study as well as the city attorney's opinion on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the most you know, the weight of this, the study, a great deal of weight should be given to our city attorneys in this regard. And so I don't think I could support this.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'City attorney and city staff. But we wouldn't be able to delve into the Jacobs report as much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well. Does anyone on staff have a preference as to whether Jacobs be there, or is that an appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Question recommending that Jacobs should be there 100%. And we believe that the two commissions, in order to respect them, that the authors of the report should be there to be able to answer any of the questions, to get into the weeds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think of the authors of the report are not there. I don't think it's it's not it's not going to answer all the questions of the two commissions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just, you know, thinking out loud here a little bit, I to trust our our city staff and our city's city attorney's office implicitly. But I, I wonder this is a very technical report that was conducted. And sometimes I know what happens at community meetings is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Assertions and things that are made that may not be technically accurate. And I wonder if staff would be in the best position to be answering those questions in such a circumstance, or whether it would be more prudent for us to invest in having the actual experts there who can answer questions about their own report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm assuming these outreach meetings are about the report that they authored, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. And you're absolutely correct. If a community member or a commissioner wants to get in the weeds and they question anything in the report, the author of the report should be there to defend it and explain the criteria when they prepared the report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So, you know, with a great deal of respect for my colleagues, Councilman Superdog and Councilman Austin here, but I have to disagree with them on this point. I think we've already invested a great deal of money into this report, and I don't think it's fair to put city staff in a position where they have to defend'",
        "'speaker_5': 'conclusions made by another individual. I think it just would not lead to a very efficient meeting because all city staff would be able to say, as, I don't know, that's what it says in the report, I can't tell you anymore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the actual person who came up with the conclusions, the expert that we've hired to assist us with this process, good or bad, that's the expert that we've chosen to help us with. This project wouldn't be there to defend their own recommendations and conclusions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to me, it almost seems like we may as well just not even have a meeting about the report. We should just have a meeting in general just to talk about airport opinions, because if we're going to talk about the report, the author of the report should be there and should be there to answer questions and whatever'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fee is associated with them. Answering the questions, you know, we don't set those fees. We can argue all day long about whether it's reasonable or not, but in my opinion, it's not prudent to have a meeting about the report if the authors of the report can't be there to defend it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's my $0.02.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with Councilmember Price. I was going to ask the same question, just the fact that we have already invested a lot in this and there's a lot of issues around transparency and making sure that community members have all their questions asked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I would hate for us to cut ourselves short of being able to have a a thorough, fruitful conversation on this. So thank you, staff, for answering these questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Garrincha.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a member who opposed the study in the first place, I do have concerns about the cost. Oh, I thought it was. Because that we didn't we didn't need to make. But I was proven otherwise by the majority of the council who voted to have the study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But now we're here. And now let's finish it. My issue is not the price so much, but how is it going to be conducted? I mean, these are meetings of the Economic Development Commission and a meeting of the airport commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I see this going sideways if if it's not done correctly in the sense that. There was a lot of community interest when we held the scoping meetings back in March or April earlier this year. There was a lot of community input.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the format of these meetings that we're going to have with the Economic Development Commission and with the airport commission is such as is held here where the public doesn't really have a voice in expressing their concerns, but rather that the the questions are being raised or being addressed by the commissioners themselves to the consultants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't I don't see the effectiveness of that, only because you're going to get a slew of people. You're going to get a roomful of angry constituents. Here who are not going to be able to have a voice and to express their concerns and to ask their questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which brings I guess brings it all around to the format. Will the public have an opportunity themselves to ask questions? And to engage the the consultants in a conversation regarding concerns they may have about the report rather than just having a1a2 phased.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Exchange between the commission and the consultant themselves without without the community being engaged in this. So how do you. What's what's the plan that you have here?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember and other council members. The these these are commissions that are led by one of the city attorneys in Mr. Parkin's office. So they actually control the decorum of the meeting and how the meeting flows. There certainly are requirements to allow the public to speak, and that's exactly what will happen here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we we plan to have a presentation from Jacobs Engineering City staff, as well as the city attorney on the aspects of the study that the city attorney's been tasked to do at that point in time. Will similar to a city council meeting, we'll hear comments from the commission, I suspect, and then there will be the opportunity'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for the for the public to weigh in. And at that time, the commission can then, just like the council can direct the staff or the consultant to answer the question specifically or wait until the end of the questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then the commission can then raise those questions that they've heard from the Council for the for Jacobs staff, for the city attorney to answer. So there definitely will be ample opportunity for the public to weigh in and have questions answered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I haven't heard that. As long as there is going to be some community input and community interaction. I will go ahead and support this item because I, I brought it up in my, in my meeting with you city manager that if there was going to be any meeting to be held, that we needed to have the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consultants there. I don't like the price, but that's the price we're going to pay to have this study. So I will approve it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So sorry. I was just curious, are there other council members that are hosting community meetings outside of these two meetings?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Staff we're we're not aware yet. We want to send there could be and we stand ready to support them. But at this stage, we've not had a request or a date to have a meeting through a council office, but we certainly will be there and would support that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That raises a very good point. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce. So if we were to have a community meeting, we wouldn't have the benefit of having the, the, the, the, the, the, the consultants. We would have to rely on staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Manager Those are some of the ground rules that you set with the company that for community meetings that we'd have city staff there. We certainly have the city attorney, but for the meetings that go before the commissions, we're going to pay for Jacobs to be there.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Are not making sense to me. How can you expect to spend several hundred thousand dollars on a study and then not have an explanation by the people that did the study? It doesn't make sense, you know, to pay any amount of money on for an expert to do their work should come with their explanation without an additional'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I used to do engineering projects with a team in Korea and a team in Russia, and we would set up video conferences so people could ask questions. We would have whiteboards, we'd have all kinds of things set up so that we could communicate.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Well, in terms of presenting it to both the commissions and city council. So the presentation to the city council that that that was included in the base contract. So that presentation to the full council is part of the 349,000.'",

The contract hasn't been fully we don't know how much of the contract has been been, actually. Expand it to this point, how much we've actually expended toward that that that contract and help you clarify, please.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We this is above and beyond the contract. So it doesn't it's not something that we have the authority just to allow, which is why it is on the city council agenda to get permission to expand the $20,000. Otherwise, we want to spend it.'",

So our business improvement districts are Long Beach City College, our Small Business Development Center, as well as city staff from multiple departments meet on a monthly basis to review the behavior and usage of this sport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We use these numbers to drive strategy not only to develop new aspects of the system, but also to test where our users are coming from. Right now, a thousand of our 2500 sessions in the last 30 days have come from the business licensing websites.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we know that a lot of people come to us looking for information about their business license. We also know what kind of devices they're using and how they're accessing this information. That big spike in usage, of course, was October 5th when this report was announced and unveiled.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We saw the highest usage in one single day, and we've seen usage reach the 2500 sessions mark, which is an incredible statistic when you consider that it's just recently been unveiled to the public. And finally, as we finish this up, ongoing development is going to be driven.'",

So we're able to capture in real time information about how we're doing rating the services rating against those those challenges that we mentioned at the beginning of this presentation cost, confusion, competitiveness. How are we doing and how can we improve?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then finally we're trying something new in that we have put our marketing and promotion tools out on an open source platform called GitHub, and that code is available to other organizations, partners that will help to embed that code on these digital banners in their websites and really try to institutionalize this point throughout the community so that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the entire ecosystem, including all of our business support services, our business improvement districts, our local universities and colleges, can embed this point in their practicing curriculum. So with that, I'll finish my report and be happy to answer any questions about this part.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And just I just have a couple comments. I would say I think this is great, fantastic. And I'm really interested in seeing what the next step is. If someone, you know is savvy enough to get an app in or go through a website to go through this process, then they probably could navigate City Hall on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'their own. But for those who aren't savvy aren't that savvy, I think this could be a good tool if it sort of helped keep that, hold them accountable to sort of the next steps and things like when they need to get, you know, signatures for a facade of a sign program, they just want to get their sign'",
        "'speaker_0': 'up. You know, another thing is it would be good if we looked into DocuSign. You know, we're still collecting wet signatures to get a rebate on like facade project or a web signatures from property owners. And sometimes you have more more than one property owner, and it isn't worth it for a $2,000 rebate to go to people'",
        "'speaker_0': 'across the country. And it would be good if we somehow streamlined it to have DocuSign in there to where they can. The next step, after you get your business open, get your grants, get your rebates and all that stuff process.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'When you get them there, you want to if you get them to download that, you want them to be able to do everything they can while you have them. That's my comments. Councilman Andrew's Councilwoman Price.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Her name is Lisa West and she's been helping businesses through this process. So this is going to be much more efficient and we're already starting to talk about it at our community meetings. So thank you. I do want to say, while the code for America people are are here that, you know, about two or three years ago'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I saw the TED talk on Adopt a Hydrant and I would love to see some quality of life apps be developed for the city of Long Beach through Code for America. I've talked about it a lot. I've talked about it with John.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've talked to I know my former chief of staff, Julie Maliki, spoke with some of the Code for America folks in San Francisco. And I recently talked with our the chair of our innovation commission. I think there are a lot of opportunities for us to incorporate technology into our quality of life issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't have the need for an adopt a hydrant here because our hydrants don't get snowed in in California. But we do have medians and trees and homeless issues and bike theft issues and bike tracking issues. There's a lot of opportunities for us to incorporate innovation into quality of life issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So community watch groups, anything like that. So I'm so excited for Biz Port not to take away from how exciting this port is, but I would love for our residents to have more of a finger on the pulse of what's happening in the city around them and have a sense of empowerment and engagement, much like our business'",
        "'speaker_5': 'owners do. But this is this is a fantastic, tremendous new addition. And Heidi, congrats for taking the lead on this. So thank you very much for the presentation. It was excellent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. This is wonderful. I actually sent a little message to Lisa while I was here thanking her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I have a couple questions are just actually just a couple of thoughts I had.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is fantastic. As my colleagues have stated, I love all this because I think that this does give businesses and entrepreneurs that are budding another opportunity to do things through tech, which is really great. What type of I know we have analytics on the back end, so I mean, are we looking maybe at a year out or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'what where are we looking at as kind of our deadline to see how this is functioning well or not?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Gonzales. So so the cool thing about the way that this architecture is built is that it's entirely iterative. So it'll continue to be shaped by the usage and behavior of the users and the feedback that we get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's also a collaborative project, meaning that our business support agencies who really drive the good work to attract and retain and grow our businesses out in the community, we're able to use this tool as a shared platform to leverage and better empower them with the tools that they might need to really expand that effort and grow business'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And so so something I think in terms of analytics and what we call business analytics is that there will be a round of initiatives coming that relate to leveraging or making open more city information through what's called our Argo hub.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a few weeks ago, really the council considered an item and approved the contract with Ezri to expand the GEO Hub and to leverage city owned data and make that available to the public to start developing even more applications that can help for them to self-serve and solve problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we really think that in terms of analytics, that the launch of the Geo Hub and the new Geo apps and we just recently featured that at the Civic Innovation Summit last Thursday and then we rolled it out in terms of the applications at at Cal State Long Beach on Saturday with our first Geo Apps challenge'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We believe that that is going to be a huge driver of opening up that data and providing more analytics about how people are using this portal to ultimately expand the number of business licenses in the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. That's wonderful. And one more thought that I'll add. I think that's fantastic. I'm wondering if there's a way and I think I've talked about it with you before, to identify these entrepreneurs or existing businesses that currently have patents, because I think that that's what makes the city very inventive and unique, is learning how many patents they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have in the city. And so that would just be really interesting. Maybe if there's a way to embed that in the software, I think that'd be great. You know, maybe clicking on something. I have a patent and maybe a short snippet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think LinkedIn is starting to do that as well. Like, do you have a patent? And that information may be very valuable to us. Thank you and great work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'What's next? Are there ways on here for us to if they're expanding their hours to collect their signatures on here to do things that will allow us to kind of fast track that growth part in a new, exciting way.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'versus exploiting the homeless issue that already exists from Long Beach to other communities. And I think that's why we need to to look at this truly as a regional issue.

I think it's important also when we talk to the city governments that are doing similar things like Santa Barbara and Monterey and Las, I think we should also talk to some of the nonprofits that are also administering these types of programs to get feedback from them, because I see'",

One is the out-of-towners I think that we can look at when we look at other cities, making sure that we have Long Beach residents that have a Long Beach driver's license, that those are the first ones that are welcomed'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into a program like this. I also want to talk about the fact that there are only a limited number of parking spaces that are probably out there and that we wanted to ensure that we're doing this partnership with churches.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I've reached out to Pastor Sanders and I've also reached out to several other clergy folks in my district that will welcome having a community process as we look forward. So it's not just with city staff coming back with a report, but that we in the community and in the districts are also coordinating with nonprofits and churches'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that might be ones that are volunteering to open up these services. And so I think that we can definitely ensure that we're not opening this up to everybody. And even though we've had the health department say that people aren't driving here by the busloads but so one I think that and to I also had a comment around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'parking and how this impacts parking. I think that if anything, this is something that helps with parking. And when we look at the cost to cities, it looks like HUD has estimated that taxpayers pay about $40,000 a year for every unsheltered homeless person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this includes expenses like emergency room fees and parking ticket enforcement. And so this is one other area that we can alleviate some of the costs that occurred with having a homeless population. So again, look forward to a study coming back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And thank you, Councilmember Pierson, the rest of the council members who brought this forward. I will be supporting this because I think it merits our attention. I'm especially appreciative of the public comments. I think there's a lot of value in public comment and hearing from our residents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so and I don't want you to get me wrong, I think this is an important issue that needs to be before the council. But in the future I'd like to see it on a normal schedule so that we have the time to, to air it to, to for public disclosure and to give the public the heads'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up to be able to come in and weigh in on an important issue like this. And so to the best extent possible, if we can avoid the supplemental agenda for or for items like this that isn't that doesn't necessitate an urgency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would appreciate that. But I will be supporting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Councilmember Austin. I'll just put it on the supplemental just so we can try to get along with the RV. If that's a 30 day or 60 day, I'm okay with having this come back in 60 days so that we can have more community input.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just would say that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I will just say I want to thank Councilmember Pearce and those who signed on with this proposal. Sometimes public policy development is a process. One item may lead to another item, one thing that you think might be an unintended, unintended consequence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You come out and give, you know, do a good, try it out at fixing it or make an attempt to fix it. And so sometimes it comes together organically. So I like this approach that allows staff to study it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It engages stakeholders like clergy in the process. So so I'm you know I'll be supporting this tonight councilmember been.'",
        "'speaker_9': '20 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Already past the 730 go. I got to go for it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because the FISA study was on the agenda tonight. I'd just like to remind you, this is we're voting for a study. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all over the place tonight. Councilman Andrews, anything else? Anybody else want to say? Anything. All right. Thank you. Members, please cast your vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This concludes our regular business. We have one more opportunity for public comment and anyone wishing to comment on an agenda items. Please come forward and state your name. You have 3 minutes. Is there any public comment?'"
