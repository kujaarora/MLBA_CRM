    "Recommendation to receive and file the Elections Plan for the 2020 Primary Nominating and General Municipal Elections.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Clark will move to item six in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Report from City Clerk recommendation to receive and file the elections plan for the 2020 primary nominating and general municipal election. Here to present information on future of L.A. County elections and the new voting system is Los Angeles County Registrar, Recorder County Clerk Dean Logan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you. Bring my book for signature. Those of you who don't know, Mr. Logan is now a published author. His book came out a few weeks ago. You remind us what it's called. So set. Have to look on Amazon.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's exciting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Case Studies on elections administration is one chapter, but I'm very pretty appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We got some stories here in Long Beach we would like to share with you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So good evening. Council Members. Dean Logan, Registrar, Recorder County Clerk for Los Angeles County. I really appreciate the opportunity to to come to speak before you today and to share some information about the new voting experience that we are rolling out in Los Angeles County, starting with the 2020 election cycle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And before I get too far into it, I want to take this opportunity to to thank your city clerk, Monique Della Garza, and her staff, who have been absolutely integral partners with us throughout this process. And we could not be where we're at with the success of this effort and with the hard work that still remains ahead'",
        "'speaker_8': 'without without her support and all the work that she's done. So thank you, Monique, for that. So I'm very pleased to share with you that that after ten years of of work and research and engagement with the public, that we are ready to move towards a revolutionized form of voting in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when I say revolutionized, I'm talking about the voting experience we have in Los Angeles County from the perspective of a voter walking into a voting location on Election Day. The voting experience really hasn't changed since 1968, when punch card voting was first unrolled here in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A lot of things behind the scenes have changed and updated since then, but from that voter experience, it really has remained the same and a lot has changed since 1968. And it is time for new opportunities, new options and new choices for voters in that voting experience.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we hope that through the work that we've done that, that we're doing this in a way that is going to increase participation, but also live up to the significance of that voting experience for our 5.4 million registered voters in Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I only have a brief period of time this evening, so I'll focus on on the significant elements of that change in voter experience. So gone will be the single day, single location, voting on a random Tuesday between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're moving towards a vote center model where voters in Los Angeles County can go to any vote center in the county over a period of 11 days to cast their ballot, which means we will have two full weekends of voting and we will give voters the opportunity to choose to vote at a location that is either'",
        "'speaker_8': 'convenient or more significant to them. So if it's easier for them to vote close to their home, we'll have vote centers in that area. If it's easier for them to vote somewhere close to work, somewhere close to where they drop their children off at school, or somewhere where they go shopping on the weekends.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That the idea here is to be present in the community and to meet people where they are. And so so if they watched a debate on television the night before and they feel engaged and they feel like they're ready to cast their vote, that while they're out in their community, they will see a place that's available for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'them to do that. So the vote centers are really the most significant change in that that allows voters to vote anywhere will open those starting 11 days before the election, four days before the election will increase that to a larger number of locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, those are available anywhere in the county at those vote centers. You will also be able to register to vote and vote on the same day. You can update your voter registration. So if you had an address change or if you had a change in party preference, you will have the opportunity to make those changes as'",
        "'speaker_8': 'well, drastically reducing the the need for provisional ballots, which often extend the canvass period in our elections process. So we're very pleased to be able to offer that. The way that we will be able to do that is through the use of an electronic pullback.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when voters arrive at these vote centers, they will check in using an electronic tablet poll book. We will be able to access all registered voters in the county. This is also our security mechanism so that if you do go vote somewhere close to work and then you try to go vote somewhere close to home, we will'",
        "'speaker_8': 'know that you have already voted and and we will be able to prevent any any attempts to vote more than once. They this will replace the paper roster. So you may recall in 2018 we had some issues with our paper rosters in L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the great things about this model is over that 11 day period, it really gives us a better opportunity to to recover and respond to any unexpected conditions that might happen during the election process. Another feature that we will unroll that we're very excited about is an interactive sample ballot, and this is an option that will'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be available to all voters. It's option. It's not required. But just as we mail everybody a paper sample ballot, we will now make the sample ballot available as an electronic app that you can download on your personal device or access through our website.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can then go through your process and press make your preselections by marking those on your electronic sample ballot. Take that with you to the vote center, scan it into the voting device, and it'll pre populate your choices so that you can print your ballot and have an expedited voting experience.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We think that's a game changer for voters who are used to interacting with their personal devices. It still allows for the security because the ballot that you cast at the vote center is that. Paper ballot that's produced app on the device.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can change your mind at that point. But we also know with all of the consolidation of elections, with the local districts and municipalities now on the even year cycle, that our ballot is going to be very long, especially in March and the presidential primary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's going to be a long ballot. So the ability for voters to have that option, to have an expedited voting experience is particularly important. That ballot marking device that you will encounter at our vote centers is that is been a labor of service and a labor of love on this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is designed truly to be a voting solution for all people, meaning that that voters with disabilities can use the same voting device that all voters use. They will no longer be relegated to a single device in the back of the room that that the poll workers are less familiar with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Everybody will vote on the same device. It allows, to a large degree, voters to customize their voting experience. So it has audio capability, it has a tactile keypad. It has the ability for voters to select the language that they wish to see or hear their ballot in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It has an adjustable touch screen so that voters in wheelchairs or voters who are particularly tall can use the same device by adjusting it. And ultimately, the device produces a human readable paper ballot that is the official record of the ballots cast.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what's going to come back to my office to be tabulated. So there is security and transparency involved in that can be fully audited and and recounted as necessary. So for us right now, we two weekends ago, we had a mock election.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We opened 50 vote centers in the community, two right here in Long Beach to introduce this to voters. We're now in a four month period of rolling this out through public education and outreach campaigns. We have a demonstration center in your lobby.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you to the clerk's office for that. That will be live here on Long Beach through the end of this month. We have street teams that are out in the community demonstrating this everywhere we possibly can. Right now, that's really the point, is to get the word out, because while this was designed by and for the voters'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of Los Angeles County, we are all creatures of habit. And unless we get the word out, people will expect that voting is the same as it has been in the past. So any assistance and partnerships for for people who are here tonight, people watching, and certainly our partners in the city, we have staff ready and available to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to assist with those processes. And we look forward to delivering a new and exciting voting experience that lives up to the significance of our electoral process for the March 3rd, 2020 presidential primary. And just to note that those vote centers will begin opening on February 22nd.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we are very close to that process. And in it, I understand there's a debate tonight going on on on television, but it does seem clear with our primary being in March that California is going to have a stake in the nomination process for the the presidential campaign.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're excited to to roll this out and to do it in a way that gives our voters a chance to be heard and to be confident that their vote has been cast as they intended to do. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Public public comment time is there we have Mr. Good you excellent and Mr. Roberts and so is the individual to come up and speak. Mr. Good you accent. Next time we. Wobblies. Yes, this is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think they're behind me and ready. But my name is Amy Ericson, and I'm a resident here in Long Beach for my entire life. I'm here with the Long Beach Suffrage 100 tonight to thank our city clerk, Monique, too, for bringing the new voting machines to the city and allowing us to come and try them out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been putting the word out through our circle of women that has been put together. We also are here going to be here every month to honor women through this year of the suffrage. And this is the perfect agenda item to do that on tonight, because the 19th Amendment was really set up for making sure that everyone'",
        "'speaker_2': 'can vote. And I think that's the important piece of what we're doing this year as we're having our events, as you're seeing us in the community. It's to remind everyone that we are here to share the idea of getting out into the community and doing good work, but also voting for the things that we need and as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well as working on the census. So you'll be seeing us working around that as well this year. And we wanted to be here tonight to honor our first women that we're going to honor throughout the year. And in this case, because yesterday was Indigenous People's Day, we wanted to honor, honor some tongva elders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's important to be aware and honor the space that we live on here in Pomona and make sure that we are thinking of those people. So we have a great man here who's going to speak about his own mom, who was one of those elders here in the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think it's also important for everyone here to know, as well as the council people that we are honoring women throughout this year that did things here in Long Beach over the last hundred years. There is an honorary there is a recommendation form on our website.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'd like each of you, including the council people, to bring up bring forward women that we should honor through your districts. We want to see every district honored in this way and anyone here in the audience to go and find that and share that with us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we'll be choosing those and bringing them to council one or two at a time through each month. We don't want to take a presentation time or extra time. We want to be able to fit this into the regular work of the council, and we're going to find good moments to do that in each of these times'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So thank you again. Some of the women of the suffrage 100 group are here. Appreciate them standing back there. If you see us around in our whites or in our sashes, it's because women are being talked about and honored in our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We came to the library opening to honor Billie Jean King being there. And we appreciate all that you guys are doing as the council to help us through this year. I'm going to give the rest of my time to Louis Robles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some like me. Um, yo.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yo MC Tax Tokyo Visa Pool. Good evening, Honorable Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Glad you could join us. And city council members, citizens.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of Long.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Beach. Welcome and good evening. Happy to be here. My name is Louis Park. Epifanio Valenzuela Ramirez, Jr.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just call me Louie. You have to remember all that. I'm a member of the one in your band of Mission Indians, a Hashim Em nation. We're state recognized as a native peoples of Orange County. Our traditional land extended from here in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long Beach, throughout, throughout Orange County, down into San Juan Capistrano. But more importantly, I'm a lifelong resident of Long Beach. I grew up in North Town, attended.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'McKinley, Long Beach, Jordan, Long Beach City. Cal State, Long Beach graduate. My parents moved to Long Beach in 1948. They bought their dream house just on the other side of the airport because they wanted to be in the country.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The north Long Beach of that time was pastures, open land. They have memories of coyotes, horses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's what brought my.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Family to Long Beach. You know, but I'm going to take you back. Before Long Beach was one more city, before there was Rancho Los Cerritos. Before there was Rancho Los Alamitos, there were the villages of Tex Sanga, a Wanga, a manga Pavone, all Indian villages here within the boundaries of the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some of those were occupied until the mid 1800s, you know, and those.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Villages were occupied by strong.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Women. There's an old saying that when you want to get words, you bring in the men. But when you want to get things done, you bring in the women. And so it's been traditional that the women of the native tribes are the ones that got things done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And my mom was a strong descendant of that. My mom believed there were there were forth there. Three things you didn't you told my mom. You never told my mom. You never told my mom can't. Don't or you shouldn't because we're all things that she was going to push against and get through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My mom grew up one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of eight and she always.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Wanted to go to school, but she couldn't. She stayed home, helped raise her younger brothers and sisters. My grandma was a single mom. She went to the bank and sat in there. This is in the 1930s. She sat in the bank until the bank president would give her a loan so she could open her own flower shop'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So she was a single mom and a business owner in the thirties and forties. So this strong spirit has been going on since Native women all to this time. And I think as we honor 100 years of suffrage, it's that strong spirit that started with the warrior native women that carries on today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so from my family, it was just a real honor that my mom was was singled out. And my mom would say, I can hear her up in the stars going, I'm just one person.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Don't I'm nothing special, you know? And so I just honored all the grandmothers here, all the mothers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're the ones that get things done, you know. And so it's those same women that that pushed for suffrage and 100 years. That's just a blessing, really. But thank you for this time. Thank you for honoring my mother.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this celebration will go for a year. And you're going to hear a lot about some incredible citizens of our city.'",
        "'speaker_9': '2 seconds. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much for all the stories we tell. The stories.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Council Members Thank you again. I want to just commend our city clerk, Monique Delgado, for all the work and recommendations you're doing for the election plan 2020. It is definitely a plan that will bring more diverse communities to the election booth, underrepresented groups into the election booth and women into the election booth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's just amazing to have a city clerk at this time, at this 2020 time, when we celebrate the right to vote. We will send you a book on Lillian Valenzuela Robles so you can learn more about her work and many other women who made who gave women agency to go to work in their communities and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'also represent the communities and ultimately have the rights that all other people have. Lastly, within this year, suffrage is an unfinished business. That is are our motto. That's what we represent, that this election plan is part of making suffrage hopefully one day finished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But as of now, suffrage is unfinished business. And thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thinking of Suarez. I want to just to add, Mr. Logan, I saw most representation in the back. It is plain back there. I just want to just commend you and your team and just thank you for how available you are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You just you and your team do a fantastic job for the entire county. I know you have a great partnership with our Clark, but I also know that the amount of work that you all put in to ensure that we have safe and fair elections is really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know 2020 is going to be a huge shift in the way elections are are operated, and certainly with technology and the way the pulse centers will be working. And so I just wanted to thank you for your work and for just continuing the partnership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much. Mr. Logan. Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to also commend you. I got to, as a county employee, attend some of the early meetings and to see a organization as large as the county of Los Angeles make critical changes, and to be so innovative and really think about keeping it lean and what does it mean and how do you honor our past and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'make sure that people have confidence in the voting system? It's really impressive work during a time when transitioning large systems has been seen across the country as very, very, very difficult. So cheers to you and the work that you and your team have done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hopefully you'll stay with the register recorder for many, many more years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I yes. On top of congratulating you guys for job well done. I think it's always important to remember why we are doing what we're doing and we know that the city of Long Beach, there's been times when we've had 10% voter turnout.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that this is not just to be up with technology, it's not just to kind of change the way that we've done things. It's to really make sure that we strengthen our democracy in the city, that everybody that is eligible to vote does vote and knows that there are different formats to get that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I really applaud you guys for thinking outside the box on how to reach those difficult to reach communities. And I applaud the awesome women here today, and I look forward to seeing the diversity of women and people that have either been a part of the suffrage movement or people that are joining.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you guys very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. And with that, please cast your votes.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the city council. So we do have a presentation for you tonight. We're excited to be here tonight to present this to the council. This is a very complex land transaction that we're doing here and a lease agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we do want to spend some time to walk through what we're doing here. The direction the council gave us and the challenge that was presented and the creative solution that has allowed us to get to this point.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I do want to give us the history of community hospital. It's been an asset that has been in Long Beach for over 90 years, opening back in 1924. It is actually a designated historical landmark and that happened in 1980.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the hospital went through a significant growth period during the 1960s, the 1980s, from a very small facility into what it was until it closed. And that was 158 licensed acute care beds, including 28 what we call acute care psych beds or behavioral health, which were very critical to the community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it had been acquired along the way by a number of different entities, but it was an under lease in operation by Memorial Care in 2011. And then we had the seismic issues that came up, and there was an identified active seismic fault line under a portion of the acute care facility that was identified in 2017, and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it ultimately was closed in 2018. And so there have been impacts. Community hospital is a is a critical asset here in Long Beach that the council really charged for for us to find a way to get it back open again.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do want to underscore kind of, you know, what it had done when it was open. There were 27,000 emergency visits in 2016 that accounted for about 10% of all the visitor visits for the area. We transported there about 5000 times from our fire department in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it was what we call the most accessible receiving area or a catchment area for stations for eight, 14, 17 and 18, which essentially covers most of the east side parts south of of near the beach and in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But it really is a community asset that affects everybody, because if that asset is gone, that means all the other hospitals that serve all the other areas are receiving more patients. And as predicted, we did see an increase in hospital and transport times when it closed in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And rescue transport times, the time it takes to get to a hospital has been up and that's over 10% and in some cases up to 20%. And so this council gave us a challenge knowing that, a the hospital group was basically turning it back over to the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We had some decisions to make and the council really set out some priorities, saying that the utmost priority is to really provide that lifesaving emergency medical services and acute care hospital that we wanted to minimize our transport time through advanced life, life support to the fire department that we needed to really be creative and look at creative'",
        "'speaker_10': 'partnerships to meet all the state regulation and minimize our costs, and that we should utilize the value of the property to help contribute, constrain the financial risk and liability. So in essence, the Council was asking us to be creative and recognizing that achieving all of this required really a different approach than a traditional real estate transaction, and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that we would be willing to accept some additional risk and some additional creativity in how we would put this together in order to deliver the potential for a hospital. There are still a number of things that are unknown, and John Keiser will help walk us through that today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is unknown about the state licensing and permitting process. There is still further geotechnical studies to do. We still have information to gather on, on detailed construction planning and total construction cost and whether or not a hospital there is financially viable for a smaller, acute care hospital.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That said, we do believe that what we are presenting to you today is the best deal to open up a hospital that meets all those critical public safety needs. And it has been a good partnership with our team at NWN and we'll talk about that a little bit at the very end.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So with that, I'd like to turn it over to John Keisler to walk us through, you know, kind of what's happened over the last year and a half and also to get into the deal terms before we get to the financials.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, honorable mayor and members of the city council. Just a quick recap on the last two years. We came to you back in November of 2017, and that was when we first received news from Memorial Care about their their needs to move on and ultimately began our process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You originally directed the city manager to do a targeted recruitment, looking at operators and developers who would have the financial and operational capability to actually address a project like this. We did due diligence on five of those operators that had presented letters of interest and ultimately landed on one fantastic team that that had the ability, the experience'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to execute such a complex project. In March of this year, we came back with a scope that both parties had agreed to for an interim agreement that allowed for NWN to enter the facility and begin not only doing some additional due diligence, but preparing the facility, submitting an application for a hospital licensing, and then preparing the facility'",
        "'speaker_11': 'for the complex permitting process. But over the past few months, we were also able to clear a number of major hurdles relative to the permitting and licensing deadlines that are imposed by the state. So where we are now is really we've made a progress in in coming to terms on the long term agreement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'm going to actually read into the record a few of those terms so that we can make sure that the public understands what this lease and cost sharing agreement entails. And ultimately, talk a little bit about some of the impacts fiscally and some of the challenges that remain.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As we know, this is to be used. The property is about 8.7 acres, but the property will be include an acute care hospital. That is something that you guys had set forth and ultimately include the medical office building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Other health and wellness related uses in emergency care has to be provided at the site at a minimum. Also, the operator has agreed that they will sublease a portion of the facility to our SART team, which is a critical component of our police department and other public safety services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Essentially effective October 15th today for up to 45 years. Under the initial term of the lease, there will be two tenure extensions that are optional, but that would be a total potential term of 65 years. We this will be at a dollar a year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there will not be a lease rate because the tenant is going to be taking on significant seismic compliance. And we'll talk about that in just a moment. But the tenant has offered and we've agreed to as additional rent, some what we call profit sharing or if there are net profits in the first five years, 20% of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that will be shared with the city. The city will not have any responsibility for for maintenance. We've learned over the last few months, as an example, that we spend almost $200,000 a month to maintain a facility like this when it's not operating.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is a large campus that it requires a lot of security, a lot of systems that need to be maintained, utilities and other things. They will have 100% responsibility for the entire. Campus, all buildings and grounds. The tenant will be solely responsible for seismic construction working with the state of California, as well as maintaining all of those'",
        "'speaker_11': 'permits over the term of the lease for the next 45 years. They will also they've agreed to split the costs of that seismic retrofit. So typically a landlord would have responsibility for major capital improvements and then provide the facility to the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In this case, they're taking on those actual the work of the seismic construction and sharing the cost. 5050 The city has agreed up to a 50%, up to the $50 million estimates that are architects and consultants estimate it will require to complete the work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we will pay our share of the seismic costs over a 15 year period on any external funding that we're able to generate. We will contribute. That could be a grant from Homeland Security or a hazard mitigation grant.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Something that could offset the costs would be credited against the city's annual seismic payments after the initial 5 million of external funding secured. So that was another term that the tenant agreed to. Now, in terms of a default, so what remedies might we have as the city?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Of course, because we've committed up to $25 million, we may withhold it any time for until the default is cured, a portion of those seismic payments. So that provides us with some security and hopes help to cure any defaults.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we have to remember that unless there's a if there is a fundamental default in that environment, we would still have to offset the costs of the initial capital that the tenant is going to be using to get their hospital started in operating any net losses that they incur other than bankruptcy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We'd be responsible for reimbursing them. And I'll get some more details on that in just a moment. Now this agreement does allow for voluntary termination. So, you know, this was an issue where if it becomes financially infeasible, if there's some sort of other outside incident that occurs, that would force them to terminate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They can do that, but they also could be entitled to recovery of their costs. And then the hospital capital costs, which they may be entitled to be reimbursed by the city, could include all the seismic work, maintenance, restoration costs, debt service for for the construction and any net operating losses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it would only be costs associated with the acute care or hospital portions of the facility. And that clock would start ticking on the effective date, which is October 15th. Now, in terms of the the hospital costs that the city could claim, you know, if there were profits generated by the facility, by the operator, that would offset'",
        "'speaker_11': 'their their claims for reimbursement, any profit share that they paid to the city and any city lease admin costs of $250,000 a year that we might incur for oversight and management of the of the lease. We would get credit for those things and then the payment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is an important term that we've been discussing for some time now that that was needed to offset the risk that this operator is taking on to to for such a complex project. But the city would ultimately have some responsibility to either reimburse the tenant for their net losses or net hospital costs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We could sell the property on the open market and then use proceeds from that sale to to pay those costs. Or we could sell the property directly to the tenant. An important term of this payment clause is that under no circumstance will the city owe the tenant more than the open market value of the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in that way, as the city manager mentioned, we are containing the ultimate or total liability with regard to reimbursement to the open market value of the property. And that was a really important condition of the city council back in March when we we entered the first letter of intent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, one other condition that we negotiated is that neither party can claim as part of their costs for reimbursement or credit anything before October 15th. So that's that's something that is important to the deal as well as the tenant has agreed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this was a major council priority that they will make a good faith effort to rehire current or former community hospital Long Beach staff that were impacted by the original closure. So with that, some of the potential outcomes that we summarize in both the council letter, the staff report, if anybody wants more detail about the more technical'",
        "'speaker_11': 'terms that I just described, you can go to the staff report and get that additional information. But here's a just an overview of potential outcomes that may have a fiscal impact for council consideration. So of course, the big one is the seismic payment under outcome number one, we approve the lease the hospital operates, it's successful.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is our ideal situation. We would have up to $25 million over a 15 year period. Of course, after that 15 year period, we're not obligated to contribute more to the project. So it's really $25 million over the 45 year term of the lease and those administrative costs that we've identified for oversight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That could also include very specific types of expertize relative to health care accounting to review the financial reports and otherwise under outcome number two, which would involve the lease being terminated prior to the end of the 45 year lease, we still could incur a $25 million of costs after you're 15, we could have paid our full $25'",
        "'speaker_11': 'million of seismic contributions and the lease could terminate after that at that time. So under outcome number two, we want to make sure that the public and the councils aware that we could have that same financial liability. And at some point after year 15, the operator could determine that it was no longer feasible to provide a hospital'",
        "'speaker_11': 'at the site. So that is a real concern of ours and we want to make sure that we're very transparent about that. But outcome number three would be that this lease is not approved tonight. And ultimately, we we shared with you that the council would decide on next steps for the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It would not be acute care because this really is our only shot at getting that done under the deadlines that the state has has imposed. But we have found out. Over the past couple of months that the carrying costs of this property, given all of its security and maintenance needs, could be anywhere from 2 to 2 and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a half million a year in carrying costs until we were to either sell or lease the property for other uses. Finally, as part of the fiscal impact funding sources, so how would we offset the costs of this proposed lease?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The big cost, of course, is the annual seismic retrofit payment, which in the first five years will be $1 million per year in year six through 15 will be 2 million per year. And if you add that all up, that's $25 million over 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right now, staff is recommending that general fund budget reductions would pay for that $1 million a year cost in in these years, these first years or another solution would have to be identified. It has been suggested, and we put this in the staff report as well, that previous actions taken by the council to consider including this as'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a public safety infrastructure asset of the city, that it may be eligible for Measure A if that are valid or if that measure is extended. So that would be an example of an alternative funding solution that's not available to us now, but could be available to us in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other liabilities, of course, are the ongoing operating costs that we have for administering these complex leases. I mentioned before it could be anything from very specific types of accounting expertize. It could also be management consulting in health care administration to help make sure that we're able to assist with the seismic compliance or other business operations associated'",
        "'speaker_11': 'with the lease. And there could be a lease termination payment now. This is an estimate estimate of 91 million based on the city's own third party appraised value of the property as if the seismic retrofit was completed. So our appraiser took a look at the property and they calculated the value of seismic retrofit that would need to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'occur. And if that retrofit was completed and the state was to license it as an acute care property, the estimate is that it could be worth as much as 91 million. That is the total potential exposure in the event that the net hospital losses, if the operator were to default, we would we we could be exposed up'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to the amount of the value of the property. So that is, again, an appraised value. If default were to occur, we would have to go to an open market sale and the market at that time would dictate what the true value is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So economic benefits. One other section, of course, property tax revenue, jobs and sales tax. These. Once a property is transferred from public to private, use those those numbers change. So we don't have assessed values for either property or sales tax, but we do see at least 250 jobs associated with the acute care facility.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So timing considerations. There is a statement of urgency included in the staff report because we have deadlines with California Department of Public Health. And so we are recommending that that council takes action tonight and that will allow for approximately 2 to 3 weeks that when our operator has indicated they need to staff up and stage equipment in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'preparation for state inspections, which they have established with California Department of Public Health and and the operator has indicated that they need some certainty. They need to know that the council agrees to this long term agreement and cost sharing agreement before they make the massive capital investment of staffing up and preparing for state inspection.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in terms of addressing council, city council priorities, staff recommendation is ultimately that after those two years of extensive collaboration, of testing the market, of due diligence and working with various potential operators, we believe that this is. This proposed lease is the best opportunity to achieve the city council direction to reopen an acute care facility at a'",
        "'speaker_11': 'community hospital. And so we are recommending this proposed agreement tonight. And ultimately, in terms of next steps, what that might look like for the community is that if the agreement is executed, approved and executed by both parties, the effective date would be October 15th.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Today, the hiring process would resume. State inspections would would take place either end of October, early November. And then, of course, once that hospital license is approved, it would be up to the operator to to open the doors.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that could be projected as early as they receive their their hospital license, with construction plans due to the state of California, what's called the Office of Statewide Hospital Planning and Development in June of 2020. So there would only be about 8 to 9 months for the city and NWN to work together and submit those detailed construction'",
        "'speaker_11': 'plans to suspend to continue seismic compliance work and continue operating the hospital. The good news is, is that our speed has given us an extension to operate until January one of 2025 because they designated our construction plans as a rebuild.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we would be able to operate or NWN would be able to operate as they go through the seismic construction to comply with state regulations through 2025. So with that, I'm going to end the staff report and answer be happy to answer any questions that you might have about the lease.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so Mayor and City Council, that is our staff report. I do want to say it took a tremendous amount of time and effort to get here and we, you know, definitely didn't do it alone. So I want to really think the mayor and the city council for giving us this direction and giving us a challenge to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'really do something out of the box to get to this point. I want to thank Councilmember Supernova, who has been this is at the top of his list every single week with us and has been really focusing on this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In addition to councilmembers Price and Mongo, who the three of them together have really formed kind of the core team. Of course, our partners from NWN, you know, this is going to be run by a private entity who needed to step up and take a lot of risk on their own to do this and especially and particularly'",
        "'speaker_10': 'John Molina without which would not happen. We want to thank the foundation for all of their support. The California Nurses Association. And then finally, just the everyone behind me, but also in the in the audience who you don't always see for city staff, particularly John Keisler.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As you can see, this is incredibly complex and the work it takes for him to really understand this and negotiate it. Rich Anthony, Oscar Orsi, Diana Tang, John GROSS and many, many, many, many others. And with that, the mayor and council, I know that was a lot, but we wanted to make sure you had an understanding of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'really the deal in front of you. And we are available to answer your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you and thank you. Acting city manager Tom Modica for all those. Thank. And that's where I was going to start. First to Mayor Garcia and my council colleagues for all your support and especially for the act last March of unanimously approving the interim lease agreement and the city team that Tom mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are six key people who did all the heavy lifting on this, and four of them are right over there. But I'll mention all six in alphabetical, alphabetical order. Deputy City Attorney Rich Anthony, Director of Financial Management. John GROSS, Director of Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'John Keiser Acting City Manager. Tom Modica, Deputy Director of Development Services Oscar Orsi. And also the Manager of Government Affairs who's now known as the Chief of Staff to Mayor Garcia. And that's Diana Tang. I'd also like to thank everyone for being here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The stakeholders, of course, all of you. John Molina, thank you for being here tonight. I see Virgin Arbutus, the new CEO of the hospital. Thank you for for being here. And I also want to mention the CMA, the California Nurses Association.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just looked up today when our first meeting was and it was November 8th, 2017. So that's before the item came to council. And we really appreciate all their efforts and have one of their original badges here with me tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think you were these for the Belmont Shore Christmas parade in 2017. So thanks for being there for the long haul. I think I'll wait for my council colleagues in the public to speak. But I just wanted to say one thing about the concept of risk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's been talked about, and John Keiser mentioned it in his report. I don't know of any real estate transaction that occurs without an element of risk. What I will say about the risk in this deal is that whatever it ends up being, it pales in comparison to the risk our residents are at for not having it here'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilman. Super now. Very well. Very well stated. I do. And I want to thank the council team, the city team and my council colleagues who have really provided a lot of patience as we go through this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This really is a city wide issue. It's a city wide asset. And although it affects the east side, primarily looking at the service area, it really extends pretty far throughout the city in terms of the patients that the hospital has serviced in the past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I did have a couple of questions that I just wanted to get clarity on. And forgive me, Mr. Chrysler, you may have already touched upon these issues, but I just wanted to call out a few things specifically, because I know these are the follow up questions that will get at community meetings and such.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just a few, few clarifying questions I have. So on page six, you talk about the external funding. Can you share a little bit more about the grants that could be secured by the city and and how that relates to what our seismic payment obligations would be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely, Councilmember. So we have a first hour seismic cap or seismic responsibility is $25 million. If we're able to secure an outside grant and we've been we've been very active in developing what's called a benefit and cost analysis of how a hospital fits into hazard mitigation or disaster management planning so that we can go after federal grants'",
        "'speaker_11': ', for instance, FEMA or the Department of Homeland Security. Those grants can be substantial. And if we're able to secure, say, a five or $10 million grant to help reopen and then seismically retrofit this asset. So it's available in a disaster.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If if we were to receive $5 million, that would just go to the project. That would go to essentially reducing the overall cost of the retrofit to both parties. If we were to get more than that after that first 5 million of of external funding, maybe it's multiple grants, maybe it has to do with fundraising that's involved'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a capital campaign, for instance. Once we get past that first 5 million, then we would start to see our seismic cap reduced as the city. So as an example, if we were to receive two grants of $15 million, our seismic cap would be reduced from 25 to $15 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that would save us as a city from using either the general fund or some other funding source. So the first 5 million goes to the project, and if there are cost overages, it could it could be the case that the $50 million estimate for seismic retrofit that that that our consultants established, it could increase and it'",
        "'speaker_11': 'could be more. So that's why the first 5 million in external funding will just carry or cover the cost of the project overall. Anything after that would reduce our cap.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So if we were to get a $15 million grant, it would in essence reduce our payments. 10 million?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And are there grants out there that are that substantial?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, we've actually seen as advertised. And periodically when there's unfortunately a disaster somewhere in the country, there will be a notification from the federal government about a certain amount of funding that Congress will appropriate for hazard to address the existing disaster.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But then I believe it's 25% of those those grants have to go to mitigation of future emergencies. That's where we have worked with the California Office of Emergency Services at the state level to identify some of these grants.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've actually just finally completed a pretty complex benefit and cost analysis so that we would be ready to apply in the event that the next round of funding comes from Congress. So yeah, it is substantial and hospitals are really, really important assets for disaster response.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this kind of project addressing seismic issues is really looked at favorably.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so I know my time is running out a little bit, so I just want to skip to a couple other questions I have and then maybe I'll circle back. You talk on page 11 about sales tax and use of the property for alternative medical.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What is the alternative medical that we're envisioning that would produce sales tax revenue? What does that qualify as alternative medical?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So ultimately, that's going to be decision for the operator to decide what kinds of medical services would be eligible and practical for the site. But if there are any medical services that would also require the sale of of.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, goods or equipment or other things. They could have a sales tax associated with them, not the services, but the complementary equipment and other sales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I see. And then lease termination payment estimated up to $91 million. Will they still cover the seismic retrofit or no? I mean, if they if they did if they terminate the lease before the retrofit is done, what happens?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So. So ultimately, if if the lease, the seismic retrofit would have to be completed over the next few years. In fact, pad the state would require the operator meet certain deadlines, which begin with June of 2020. So if they were to terminate over the next couple of years, it would be before, you know, the seismic deadline'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on the city would only be maybe a couple of years into the payments, a couple of million dollars. So, number one, our liability would be capped by how far along in the project that they get. Number two would be it depends on how much they've invested at that time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So had they started the construction or had they realized within just a matter of months that the cost for construction may exceed their keep their capacity? So it will completely depend upon where they are in the process. You know, the way we've structured it is that there's disincentives to stretch it out and there's disincentives to to walk'",
        "'speaker_11': 'away. But hopefully, both parties also have incentives to stay in the deal because of the potential benefits that completing the project entail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think let me and let me go ahead and maybe go back around and if we pick you up a thousand repairs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I also wanted to recognize I'm not going to list everybody but everyone that's been listed and everyone that's been a part of this. Congratulations for getting us here. I know it. We have the the big R word risk, but I think it is a risk that is worth taking whenever we put our constituents and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'health care needs of our community first. I had two points. So when I'm looking at option one and option three, essentially what you're saying is it's the same cost if it was for that period of time. But we're investing in a hospital versus just sitting on property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know it's a silly question, but I just want to hear it said one more time. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. Correct. In the cost of of a property that's not activated is a liability because it's not generating revenue and it's not generating public benefit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you for that. I wanted to ask what the hiring process would start soon. What does that process look like?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, well, fortunately, we have a Pacific Gateway already working on this and we have a representative that this is underway. So we have been over the past few months collecting names of interested potential staff for the site. And if you would like, we do have more detail about what's what's happening now and to to ramp up for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the inspection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just briefly. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I'd like to introduce Lucius martin, who is our business outreach manager for Pacific Gateway.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. We've been onsite involved with Community Hospital as the Workforce Development Agency for the City Pacific Gateway since May of 2018. We provided 11 rapid response sessions during that time to the existing memorial care employees. Since that time, we've provided a survey to all of those that were interested in coming back to Community Hospital under the new'",
        "'speaker_9': 'operator, which over 250 respondents completed the survey of the 250 respondents, I would say. Half of those are Long Beach residents. Many of those folks had to temporarily move on. But after doing this kind of work in workforce development for 15 years, I've never met another group of employees that were impacted that were so passionate about coming'",
        "'speaker_9': 'back to the place that they had been separated from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's great. Thank you for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That. One last question. I know the governor signed several bills that were very exciting recently, but I understand he did not sign the one that would extend it to 90 days before somebody could close a hospital. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's what that's what we understand is that he declined to sign the bill sponsored by Assembly member O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Heartbreaking. I just wanted to publicly say that that is is heartbreaking. And so in this one where it could be terminated. What's the length of time that that you guys have agreed to?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So in this case, this is this this contract. I'm not going to say supersedes it. But but the agreement between us is is 180 days. So in the agreement, if there's the notice of termination, it's far longer than the state regulation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we can always be more strict than than the state in that case.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's wonderful. I want to thank the parties involved in making sure that we obviously this has taken us two years to get here. But having 180 days is much better for our community, not only the workers, but the residents that live there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So congratulations on this. I'm very excited to vote yes tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And council woman mango.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. A lot of great work has been done. I just wanted to once again thank the community. For two years there have nearly always been someone who supports community hospital at dozens and dozens of community events and functions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We go to a month and I know that there's a group of fifth District residents, two or three in particular, that make a habit of attending all the meetings, looking to the audience. But the light's not great, so I don't see them right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to be there and to be able to answer questions from your your peer community members is just so powerful. So the work that you've done has just been really, really impactful. And we thank you because I can answer those same questions at community forums over and over and over again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to hear it from their own neighbors and while I am a neighbor, they really love the passion and commitment from each other. So thank you for that and for your continued crusaders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have some public comments. Let me ask Larry Goodhew, Brandi Welch, Ellen Lockridge, Jackie McCann carelessly. Please come forward if I can have everyone line up, please. On the at the podium, we have Brandi Welch and Ellen Makris, please, and Jackie McKay and carelessly in that order, Mr. Goodhue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Come on, Larry. Good you address on file. I thoroughly support this. Always have. I think it's an outstanding project and I'm wondering whether or not we could get additional funding, additional federal funding. To have an expert. In psychiatry.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Start looking into the conduct and the behavior. And the criminal conduct of our mayor and the councilperson from the second district. And they're in get some federal studies. To help this city and other cities identify those. Problematic people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That has cost this city so much money. In actual dollars as far as a reputation. I think it's well worth. Examining that possibility we have without question. No question. Within three years, both of those individuals are going to be behind bars.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The feds are already working on that. But we should not have had to wait that long for that. And unfortunately, unfortunately, my sense is the. Our city prosecutor is not the most aggressive person in the world. So the fact is, well, there are always going to be bad guys.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We need some professionals to be able to identify those. And I think that this is a great place to start. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Good. Next step is Brandy. Brandy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much for allowing me to address the council this evening. My name is Brandy Balch. I'm a registered nurse at Long.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'That would require hospitals and health care facilities to provide 180 day notice to the public before downgrading its services and or closing a facility. Well, California lawmakers.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Ellen Markowitz. I have a couple of things to say. First, Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for keeping this going because I know we would both rather be watching the debates right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To all of you, this has been a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hard work and I am so forever grateful. I am a former employee of Community Hospital of Long Beach. I started working there in 1983.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lucius I would like to be a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Current employee of Long Beach Community Hospital, so just make sure I'm on your list somewhere. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really am so excited that the possibility exists for our little hospital to open up again because East Long Beach needs an emergency room.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much next week to please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Good evening, Jackie McKay. And I just wanted to thank you for all the hard work you've already done. And I know it's a big ask financially to keep asking you to do this. I know it doesn't displace the human cost you about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Last April, my mother called and she wasn't feeling well. So ordinarily I would just drive her over to community because we live about a mile away. Unfortunately, she's a Kaiser patient.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I drove.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Her to Kaiser Downey and she died in the parking lot. And she would have died either way, you know, not for nothing. She was older, but is a human cost is so much bigger than this financial thing. And I'm so grateful you guys are taking that all into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I must just please put me on the list. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Closely.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Carelessly. Here. I agree that we need an acute care hospital, and I understand that everyone is emotionally attached to that location. But this business deal, it doesn't get you what you're looking for. I mean, I want to thank staff for being so candid.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's in your paperwork. If you look at this, it talks about the risks and what it's going to cost us. And if you look at outcome number two on that chart, that should be enough to stop everyone in their tracks.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, what that says is that at any time Mr. Molina can back out of this deal and that we owe him. We need to reimburse him for all of his investment, which is potentially tens of millions of dollars, and that the reimbursement amount is limited to and likely offset by the sale of the property.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what you get is probably just that you're going to lose this property eventually. And it even says on this number two, for several reasons this is a likely outcome. So that's from your charts. It's hard for me to understand that we would want to pursue this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'To protect his investment, Mr. Molina wants an escape clause where he can walk away from it for any reason, and the city has to reimburse him. He can be purchased the property and repurpose it at any time, and we give him his investment back.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if he sees a better deal, whether this is a viable hospital or not, he can shut it down. That that's not a good deal. How does that get Long Beach, an acute care hospital. The the risk all seems to be on the city side.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Why don't we build one somewhere else? Why don't we go find someone who knows how to build these at states? And here he doesn't make any claims to be able to run a hospital or to even know how to do this seismic retrofit.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So why choose a location that is fraught with risk? The overall terms of the lease make it financially beneficial for the tenant to terminate the lease at some point, regardless of whether or not the hospital is viable. That should be enough to stop you in your tracks.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We're going to eventually lose this property. That is the outcome of this deal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Premier Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. First of all, I thank my colleague, Mr. Superdog, because the fact that we know in the east and the east side of Long Beach, we need an emergency hospital. I think if you can just take a look at it and see about the homeless crisis and the mental illness that we have, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, the closure of the community hospital. It's led to overcrowding at the emergency rooms in St Mary's and the mama hospital. This is something that's almost a necessity that all of us should take time to look at. It shouldn't be about money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's about human lives. And this is why I think that, you know, team has expertize and dedication to make this project work. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Q I'm going to get I cued up again because I spent my first 5 minutes asking questions and I didn't get to talk really about how I feel about this project. So I felt the need to queue up again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I think here here's how it plays out practically for a resident in and on the east side and why this is so important for us. And I have multiple personal stories, but about three weeks ago, my mother had to call 911 and our amazing fire department went and got her and helped her.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they had to transport her to Los Alamitos Hospital because that was the closest hospital. And it was it's about six a little more than six miles away from her home, whereas community hospital would have been at least half that distance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to me, which I just shared a few minutes ago, I've got a mother who's battling breast cancer, metastasized breast cancer, and is on multiple medications and minutes matter. And so for me, not having an acute care facility, that's just my personal story.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'm sure there's hundreds, if not thousands of stories just like that where the option is not there for East Side residents, and that's a problem. Personally, I'm grateful that we have a partner, at least one of the partners, and all of them are wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at least one of the partners has a heart for the community such that they're willing to invest in making this 90 year. Offering for the city of Long Beach continue to exist and to ensure that the historical designation of the site as a landmark in our city continues to exist and serve the purpose for which it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is known. I think it's it's really every time we want to build a new facility or we want to reinvest in a facility, some of the comments that we hear is build it somewhere else. Why don't you start from scratch and build it somewhere else?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think. That's a very shortsighted argument. I say that with respect because you have to have the appropriate site and location, the financials have to work out and they have to be the location has to be in a place where it services the population that it's intended to serve.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would mean we would need to find another site, a site of this size that's able to facilitate this type of service or offering. And that's something that we can talk all day long about, about how plentiful those opportunities are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But in reality, they are not. If such opportunities were even available, which they are not, they would be very costly for the city and for our partners to get to a position that we need them to be. I'm not saying that there's not risk involved with this deal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There absolutely is. And I'm also not saying that I'm not concerned about that risk. I absolutely am. But what I am saying is, given the import of this facility to the east side of Long Beach and to the to the city in general, it's a risk that's worth taking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I very strongly support this item tonight. And I thank staff for educating us and taking us through the process. And on behalf I mean, I look out in the audience right now, and I have at least five of my own residents that I see sitting in the audience, several of whom live like two blocks away from'",
        "'speaker_6': 'me. And I see them as I walk my dog. Any one of us would be in a position where we would need emergency services. And right now our best option would be Los Alamitos Hospital, which simply does not have the capacity to take Long Beach as an additional resident or additional customer base, patient base.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you very much for your work, Mr. Heisler, and your team and of course, our city manager. Acting city manager for the great work that you've done. We appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. I'll just do what I can to add to that. I want to just, again, thank our staff for the great work and the very candid staff report. I mean, we have basically all the information we need to to make a make an informed decision this evening.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One also recognize and compliment my council colleagues led by Councilmember Supernova, who has been on this issue from day one. And I'm certainly here to support his efforts and the community's efforts here this evening. A lot has been said about risk here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We heard that word over and over again. And it appears to me that when I weigh the risk, there are risk with any of the three options before us this evening. The staff is laid out. We went we entered into this down this road with a goal in mind to restore an acute care hospital, to meet the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'needs, the health care needs of the residents in East Long Beach. And provide relief for overall emergency care system in our city. A community hospital has certainly met those needs. It is situated geographically in a place that that meets the needs.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And it has done so for many years. And so it's clearly an asset for our city. And for that, I'm just going to be very short and sweet. I'm willing to take the risk to save lives, to provide critical care emergency services, and restore up to 250 health care jobs in our city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't believe we can afford not to take this risk. And for that, I'll be supporting this item this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And before we go to the vote, I just want to say a couple a couple words. The first thing I'll say is I want to just think the incredible work that's gone into getting us to this point, not just from the staff we've done, I think, a real phenomenal job under difficult circumstances.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank the this council and the body for continuing to be supportive of the reopening of community, especially, of course, Councilmember Supernova. But the entire the entire council has been has been involved and active on this issue, particularly those on the east side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank the community, the foundation, the multiple members of the community that have reached out and sat down with me to kind of talk over overall about the impacts of the hospital and its closure on the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I certainly want to thank the medical staff, the team, the nurses. You've been phenomenal and great partners and probably our strongest advocate, certainly in the capital in Sacramento. And we're just we're proud to stand with you in this struggle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we know that there is going to be a good outcome on the other end of it. So I want to thank you for that. And of course, I have to thank when I meet Mr. Molina, you and your partners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The truth is that we went through a process and we went through a competitive process to get us here. This was not a decision that was made lightly. It was a decision that was made through looking and putting out interest and getting getting back interest from from from different folks and seeing what was actually viable and, and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'who could actually put this project and this deal together. And where we ended was and this this partnership with me, when that staff has been so supportive in promoting and ensuring that it get across the finish line. So I really am grateful to Mr. Molina and the team for their commitment to not just reestablishing an important part'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of our community, but really a community has been a legacy and a important part of our city's history. And so I just want to thank you for also preserving that and understanding the value of not just the emergency services, but of the history and the jobs and the connection that this site has to to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to note that there has been a lot of work that's happened behind the scenes in Sacramento to get us here. I think, obviously, we've been engaged on the day to day conversations, but I can't express enough how how appreciative we are to the different agency staff that have worked hard, in particular Assemblymember O'Donnell and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'his team, who have been very instrumental. And I also want to thank Diana Tang for her active work in this whole process as well. And so thank you all. And of course, I am supportive and I agree there absolutely is risk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The greater risk is to leave your hospital closed. And so with that, members, please go ahead and cast her. Mr. Molina, did you I feel like you almost jumped out of your chair. Did you want to say something?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm John Molina. I am representing M.W. and I think this hospital is very aptly named. It is the community. I want to thank the nursing staff, the physicians, the medical staff, all of the other employees maybe who aren't caregivers, but support the caregivers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Everyone who came to the numerous community meetings that were held to give their input the success of this hospital, and I have no doubt it will be successful, is going to be due to that commitment of everyone in the community to band together, to revitalize an asset that is here for everyone's benefit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We didn't get into this. To make a lot of money. We didn't get into this to make it a land transaction. It was a very difficult negotiation, but it was one that John Keisler and Rich Anthony and the teams that you've all mentioned came in with their eyes open and with a goal of making things work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The thing that strikes me in hearing folks talk, both sides talk about the critics and those that are supportive. What you are doing tonight is entrusting us. To manage a city asset. And I take that trust very, very seriously, as seriously as you folks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it is a big obligation on our part. And we will not let you down. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Mr. Molina. And with that members, please go ahead and cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Can I get. Thank you. Thank you all. Can I get a motion in a second for the consent calendar, please? She continued, You have anything for consent? Okay. Please cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not here today to oppose the entertainment permit, but I am worried about today's. This has been an ongoing issue at the boathouse for five years regarding this establishment, which Stuart just bought maybe nine months ago. I don't blame Stuart one iota for what he's trying to accomplish.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd be doing exactly the same thing he's doing. But unfortunately, I think what we're going to do is going to add more problems to the existing problems we already have today. They just said it's a restaurant bar. He has no kitchen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He has no restrooms. He's built a 20 foot wide or 15 foot wide garage door that bleeds out to his patio now. So I know one of the conditions are that you have to have the entertainment inside. Well, I know exactly what he's going to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'An entertainer is going to have his feet right on the line of the inside of the building. And he's going to be playing to a total audience of inside and outside. Well, before it was just inside. The vast majority of these people go to the restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He has one. He has a key for one bathroom upstairs. London boats, which has 25 duffy boats right around the corner from me, has no bathrooms. They use the same key to go to the same bathroom. I'll just tell you right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What do you think? They're all going to go into the boathouse? And I would do the same thing and use the bathrooms at the boathouse. Aqua Link. 14,000 people wrote our link in the month of August. No bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Guess where they're going? The dock is next to the boathouse. I don't know what to say that. I just want to make sure that conditions, whatever they may be, they have to be put in place. They have to be followed up on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Being 20 years on Pine Avenue within in segment license I had, you could never get rid of the bad guys. Nobody would ever do anything. Nobody is held responsible when they're going overboard with the music. We pay $450,000 in rent annually in that location.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The wine bar is going to pay 25,000. He has maybe one or two employees. We have 90 employees. I'm just concerned. And my license is ten feet away from his patio. I'm license in the courtyard. I don't know whether the staff knew that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We use that courtyard all the time for banquets and it's tied into our banquet room. So there's already a clash. I've lived and breathed this stuff for 40 years in this city. I had my first restaurant I built here in 1979.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know what the issues are and how the remedies are, and it's a very slow process. So I just want to make sure there's a method that we can come to with the city to have somebody license taken away, not in a nine month, one year, 18 months, two year fashion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If it's creating a negative impact, it needs to be addressed. And I'd like to recommend maybe putting a committee together of city staff, the financial staff or whomever puts out an entertainment license that they meet on a quarterly basis and discuss other issues to where that can be addressed immediately and not get aggravated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's all I have to say. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Do we have staff that's prepared to talk? I only caught the tail end of Mr. Morris's comments as staff prepared to address that issue because I agree with him. It's it's really difficult for us when someone's not following the rules in terms of entertainment at their establishment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My staff and I have tried to do our own like counter-surveillance measures. And it just so turns out every time we go to a place, there's never music playing when we show up. So can you address that?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes. So we appreciate Mr. Morris comments. And we know this has been an issue in the past. The entertainment permit that we're recommending tonight does have a condition that does state that all entertainment has to remain indoors, so any doors or windows have to remain closed during the hours of the entertainment.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I know that garage door concept was a concern of yours. So that is addressed in the entertainment permit. And we also work with PD on these issues. So if issues were to come up regarding the entertainment, they do contact us right away and we stay on top of those issues and stay in touch with them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And thank you for that. I appreciate that. You know, I will be watching this issue very closely and working with our acting city manager on making sure we have a swift response when we do have complaints, because we also have a lot of live awards in that area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I do know Mr. Morris's business is fortunate to have received an entertainment permit, and we do monitor and very responsive to calls or complaints that we get from liveaboard with with that business. And we would not that we've gotten any complaints.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But in general, we want to make sure that we're treating all businesses the same in terms of what they are allowed to do in their operations and how it impacts everyone else. So that's absolutely important. I want to talk about this particular item I'm in supportive of this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've met with the new owner of this business. I will say I was extremely disappointed in the practices of the previous owner since they were completely out of compliance with the city's rules and expectations. No permits were sought in the manner that they were supposed to be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I have been personally assured by the owner, the new owner, that that won't happen. And I feel very confident. We've also been working with the tenant at that location to ensure that the signage for bathroom facilities and other public access points are made clearer so as not to impact other businesses in that shopping center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I will state right now for all time this will be recorded, that it's my expectation that every business owner with whom we do business in that shopping center understands that having an entertainment permit and other conditions associated with running a successful business there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Comes with it. A lot of responsibility. And that responsibility is both to the city, to the residents and to the other businesses in the area. We expect you guys to work together in a friendly competition in order to ensure all of your successes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That entire area is changing. Tremendous opportunity for all of us. And I think that if we're working together within the rules and helping one another be successful, everyone serves a different interest in that. It's a very diverse set of businesses there, and they serve different populations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I want us to be able to work together and make sure that we are respectful of the impacts that our business model will have on the other businesses. So with that, Stewart, I completely would you like to say a few words?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Councilwoman Price We just wanted to ask within this entertainment permit, we can add a condition regarding the signage for the bathrooms, if that's a concern for the parties involved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I don't think anyone would object to that. I think signage that clearly marks where the public restrooms are would be great. And I understand there there were reworking some of the signs because it before it said bathroom for tenants and the average customer doesn't know what that means.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think we're changing it to have London Vote Rentals and marina wine specific signage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Stewart Nakahara and the new owner of the Marina Wine Bar. I just want to thank you, Councilwoman Price, for all your help and Lisa West in your.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'For all.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'You've given me throughout this process. And I do know it's a long.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And tedious process with a lot of information. The first thing that I'd like to address that came up are the bathroom situations, because that's something we've really worked hard at trying to fix. We've been having meetings with the Counsel's Office as soon as or as recent as last Monday to come up with maybe changing the even the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'traffic flow. So instead of sending people out our front door to go to the restrooms, that goes right past the boathouse, front doors to send them along this other corridor that we have that leads them straight up to the stairs where our bathrooms are with a big.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sign that says Marina Wine Restrooms upstairs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we think just maybe changing the traffic flow will help a lot of that and push people away from the front door, from the front or the boathouse instead of coming up through through our ways. So that's one thing that we're working on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I believe the artwork for the sign is done and I'm not sure if it's been ordered yet, but I know that everyone's signed off on it and gotten it ready to go. As far as the other stuff that we talked about, to Mr. Morse's point that you made earlier about music being outside and with the previous'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ownership not necessarily in compliance. If you're familiar with the area, about a year ago there was an outdoor stage that was built on an exterior platform out in the out in the courtyard that music faced out from the parking lot and it wasn't shielded by any sort of buildings was surrounding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was just there echoing out in competition with a lot of the other noises that were out that were coming from Milanese and a couple of the other spots. One of the first things that we did is we tore that out and got rid of it and moved the entertainment inside.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have a large garage door that we put in that rolls up that extends indoor to the outdoor. We created a music performer's area inside. We don't have any speakers outside anymore. We also got in all of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My goal in this wine bar is not to be a rock bar or a club. It's a place that you can sit down and have a glass of wine or beer and not have to shout to be heard.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So our goal isn't to create music that is exuberant and, you know, beyond our whatever. I think it's 50 feet from our patio. That's that goes straight to the boathouse. We've been really, really diligent about making sure we don't have speakers in that area and that we are being good neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There is a lot of entertainment in that area. Milanese, I know, has a speaker that they put outside that faces us toward the parking lot, the boathouse area. Their music is on the backside. So we don't really hear them and I don't think they hear us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But there are customers coming in and out do so we just try and be really aware of of that situation. Where we're located is right in the center, right at the entrance. So I feel like it's our responsibility to put together a good foot forward, not just for us, but for the complex as a whole.'",

There is so much happening at this location. And so I just would be interested and maybe Councilman Price might, you know, might be more plugged in.'",

It has become so active with so many great businesses coming in that there are some conflicts between the multiple different uses down there the boaters, the the visitors, the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we are actively working on it with the groups. It is city property down there, but it's also privately managed by a group called Bandcamp. And then we have all of the city assets that are there. So we are currently in the process of really working on the parking because that is one of the larger issues'",

Good evening, Honorable Mayor. Members of the Council, I'm here to provide you some updates on what we've been doing with the ordinance and what we're going to be continuing to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm very excited to do that. It's hard to believe that this council requested this ordnance already. One and a half years ago, on September 3rd of 2018, we reached phase one in this phase included city facilities and permitted special events.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Phase two included larger restaurants as defined by the city council as being 101 people or more seating 401 people or more and franchised restaurants. That includes our subways and Starbucks and McDonald's and Jack in the Box. And it's interesting that many of these chain restaurants were already in compliance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There have already been some pressure on these restaurants, too, to steer away from polystyrene. So the subway's Chipotle Starbucks, jack in the box, McDonald's, all these chains were already in compliance. We did have a few like Chick fil A and 7-Eleven that requested specific assistance staff provided them with that.'",

It also includes a ban on certain retail products such as craft beads, pies, expanded polystyrene craft beads and coolers. 77% of the food establishments in the city fall under phase three, so a huge chunk of the food establishments fall'",
        "'speaker_9': 'under phase three. I'd like to note that the Health Department started making site visits back in September of 2018, and to date they've found that one third of the restaurants that fall under Phase three are already early compliant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also had public works staff go out over the summertime, starting much later than September 2018, around June of 2019, and in a three or four month period, they visited nearly 300 restaurants and found that out of a sample of 287 businesses, 43% were already in early compliance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we were really pleased that that the restaurants are partnering with us so actively. So how did we get this message out there? We did a lot of outreach and education. We had direct mailers sent in June of 2018.'",

January 2019 and about a week ago, we sent follow up postcards reminding the affected businesses of what their requirements were.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We also we also have a phone free website for that provides resources and education to these businesses. And I'd like to mention that we gave away nearly $13,000 in incentives to our businesses. To put that in comparison to other cities we're aware of that have afforded economic incentives were San Francisco which is much larger obviously and Encinitas'",
        "'speaker_9': 'which is much smaller. Obviously, neither city had anyone to apply for economic incentives. We really put that message out there. So some of our businesses could take advantage of that, and we're really proud of that. We also did a little knock and talk.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We borrow that phrase from elsewhere. We visited 362 businesses. We had a multilingual strategy. We had print advertising, fliers, lots of social media posts, lots of Facebook and website promotion of the program. We called it phone free. Long Beach was how we branded it, and businesses who complied with the ordinance, if they so chose, could join from'",
        "'speaker_9': 'free Long Beach and become a phone free Long Beach member. And what we do is then promote those restaurants as being phone free. We provide them with window decals, a letter from the mayor. We provide them with paper straws and special recognition, one on one assistance and promotion at city events.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We visited restaurants in every council district. We visited at least 30 restaurants in every council district. Obviously, some council districts have more restaurants than others, or certainly they might be clumped together more than others, making it easier to hit more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we had very positive reactions and especially want to call out restaurants along Retro Row in CD2, in Belmont, Shaw and CD3 and along Atlantic Avenue in CD8. Such willingness and downtown's such willingness to participate, and it's almost as if they teamed up together and said, Let's just do this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, it was great. Continued promotion of foam free Long Beach. Over 100 posts on Facebook and Twitter. Six weeks of advertising on Facebook and Instagram of nearly 30,000 people reached on that 13 print ads in multiple languages, including the Grunion Gazette, the Long Beach Business Journal, LA Opinion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This next slide is one of my favorites because these are three businesses I wasn't even familiar with, and we like to go out to new restaurants and places to try out. And this is exactly what we were trying to accomplish with the Fall Free Long Beach Partnership is to promote these businesses, and we're checking out new restaurants'",
        "'speaker_9': 'all the time now that we didn't even know existed. So we're really excited about that. But that's not all. Along with our foam free Long Beach campaign, we started to bring your own Long Beach campaign, and that was helping people make commitments to reusing their own material.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, for example, we have given out about 5000 packages of reusable to go items. You may have seen some of these. They include reusable cutlery, collapsible bowls, reusable chopsticks, metal utensil kits, reusable straws. And we have gotten pledges from 4000 residents of Long Beach to utilize these items and take them with them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The goal being as more and more people bring their own reusable items. Restaurants need to purchase fewer fewer products to use for to-go items. I have to compliment the Health Department on what amazing partners they've been. They've played a major role in compliance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They've played a major role in education. And without their support, this wouldn't be possible. They have integrated education and compliance into their annual food facility inspections. They go to the facilities each each year, and they've been working with the businesses to help them come into compliance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Their main focus, as they do with any new roll out of programs, is education, education, education. How do we get people compliant who aren't? They found that 33% of the businesses they've visited are already in compliance. And as I said earlier, a smaller sample over the summer, over a shorter period of time, we found 43 are actually'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in early compliance. Enforcement procedures allow for a focus on education. That's the goal. The second visit will reinforce that compliance requirements. A third visit may result in an administrative citation, which seldom, if ever, happens. Or an office hearing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A fourth visit could result in a referral to the city prosecutor or business licensing. The ordinance allows for a procedure to be put in place for temporary exemptions due to hardship. No one has asked for that temporary exemption at this point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A hotline has been created and online format will be available for the public to report repeated violations to us. At this point, I'd like to thank the Council for having a thoughtful approach to this and phasing this in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a unique way of doing it. Most cities that we don't know of, any other city that has a phased in process of this type. Most cities just give you 30 or 60 days and you're either in compliance or you're not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You move on. So I think the businesses are very appreciative of that sensitivity. Thank you. And I would just like to add quickly that I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Recognize the leadership of Erin Roland. She's been leading this effort for the city. She's done a fantastic job in. Get to the point. We are and we look forward to her continued efforts as we move into phase three.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. Do you have any. Public comments. I don't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No strangers, Vice Mayor. Can I say a few things?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I was going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I was gonna go by the diocese. Okay, fine. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. Vice Mayor. Sir. Thank you for that report. That was a really, really great report. I'm surprised, pleasantly surprised to hear that 33% of the small businesses are in early compliance. That's incredible. Thank you for that statistic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I didn't know it. I know that when we initially those of us that really advocated for a phased in approach, wanted to know what the fiscal impact might be for the small businesses to phase in fully. Do we did we do a study on that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we have any who did the study? Do we have any information on that? Like what is the cost to them? What kind of a burden is this for a restaurant that that seats 101 or less?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Price We didn't do a formal study. We didn't commission a formal study for that. We do have some research, though, on cost comparisons, and we found very little differences in cost comparisons. And it also depends on what a business decides to use.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have one business that went to a using aluminum foil and said they saved a tremendous amount of money over it. And we have some businesses that have chosen to go more expensive options. But they've also commented that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Their customers seem to really appreciate the fact that they've moved on, as there seems to be some sort of social stigma starting to develop over polystyrene. So, you know, I can give you some examples where we have foam, for example, a 16 ounce foam cup for cold drinks was about.'",
        "'speaker_9': '$0.04 a cup, and now they're about four and a half cents a cup in some cases. We have other examples where a nine inch foam plate was about $0.04 a plate and now the paper plate is $0.01 a plate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it really is all over the map.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's fair to say that in some cases they actually reduce their costs. In some cases, their costs went up. But in those cases, it's negligible. The range is around a half a cent or so it appears.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I would say it probably averages maybe a penny.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then remind me on this. Did we did we include large retailers like Smart and Final and other retailers in our ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'With respect to the ban, the retail sale ban on ice chests and with the Kraft foam balls. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But not as to cups, plates, things of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So there's an opportunity there to to further expand the ban.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. If you should so choose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm frankly, I'm surprised that they're still selling those, but that's just my personal opinion. And the other thing that I thought was interesting is that no one has applied for the hardship exemption. Was that something that was discussed in all the visits?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That that's an option?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can't honestly say it was discussed in all the visits, but yes, they were made aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. And I'm assuming that's included in the outreach materials that we provided.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, it was. And I think an important point that we wanted to add to your question earlier about economic impact. One of the things that we're also trying to champion, and we included a slide is to bring your own campaign.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we're finding that more and more restaurant patrons are actually bringing their own containers to to if they're having take home and they're utilizing that. So I think the overall usage of the containers themselves are going down, that that's a trend we're seeing happening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's great. Finally, on behalf of the third district, I want to thank you. It looks like you went to 75 businesses, restaurants in the third district, more than any other district. And I'm assuming that's probably mostly due to our business corridors because they're highly concentrated in those business corridors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I thank you for doing that. I think that individual outreach goes a long way. And I will say just anecdotally, I'm noticing trends in terms of the bring your own. I work in a courthouse on a day to day basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my the my staff that works for me are all much younger than me. And they've apparently caught this on this train long before me. And they a bunch of them got stopped at the metal detectors because they were trying to bring in their own knives and forks for their lunches.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the bailiffs were looking at them like they were aliens. Like what? What are these little bags? They had all had these cute little bags that had like their straw, their knife in their fork. And they they all you know, someone went and bought some for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was trying to bring them in. So they called the supervisor and they're like, your employees are trying to bring knives and forks into the courthouse. And they said, well, of course, we don't want to use the plastic ones.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this definitely is a as a change. And I could see how that social stigma would continue to grow in light of what I'm seeing with my the opportunities for learning that my staff provides me every day. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I was wondering. No, no, I wasn't trying to stop.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you for the great report. I have another item coming up right after this. Obviously, to expand a little more on this on this topic. But a lot of the outreach and education component of this process, especially when you're raising it in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's very important to keep people connected with what's taking place. So I have a new one here. So it's a knocking talker. That's a that's a that's opposed to what I always do, what I'm campaigning, which is smile and dial.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Impressive flesh, though, which is what I'm doing when I'm here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We all have our methods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, we do. But no thank you. And and in the multilingual strategy, it obviously is, is is working. But again, I think we need to expand the efforts and try to get the the mobile restaurants more and more in tune with what's taking place, especially to be operating here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So but thank you for your efforts on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And while many third district restaurants were mentioned, I don't recall a mention of Jojo's in the fourth District, but I believe they are part of the plastic campaign, foam campaign.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They absolutely.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'That's what I'm from what I'm hearing. I think the goal would be is that we would work with the restaurants to have alternative options. And so, for example, if there was a member of our community with a disability and wanted a straw, I mean, similar to the example that we shared this evening, there are alternatives to plastic'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that can still serve the same purpose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, I guess that would be the better goal. But if I wasn't seeing a difference between someone carrying one in from a store and this does not regulate retail sales once again. So the the juice boxes with the little straw glued on the side will still be in existence, unfortunately.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely. As you may be aware, the recycling markets, the commodity, passive commodities do not have any value anymore.

        "'speaker_8': 'Two other government officials said. The officials again spoke on the condition of anonymity because the planning hasn't been publicly revealed. The changes would attempt to give the federal government a larger role in supervising the housing and health care for residents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Given the cruel and unusual.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Treatment that this administration has exhibited against immigrant families while utilizing remarkably similar terminology. It is worth taking the news of this latest sadistic policy very seriously. Martin versus Boise recognized that Anti-Camping laws that kick the homeless out represent an unconstitutional, unconstitutional form of cruel and unusual punishment by.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Denying individuals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The right to sleep, by having the city of Long Beach officially endorse this effort to get a reactionary.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right wing Supreme Court to overturn this landmark.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Decision. Instead, please affirm the legal status and human dignity of all of our residents by passing a local homeless Bill of Rights following an example set by the states of Rhode Island, Illinois, Connecticut and Colorado. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Is Derek where the police? Derek, come forward. Is Katie Jay here? Katie. Gerry, please come forward. Katie.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'My name's Derek, where I am born and raised right here in Long Beach. My father served in the United States Navy for 25 years and served stated for 20 years. I have a degree in sociology and I'm currently homeless.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm the founder and CEO of Homeless of Possessed Land Homeless Solutions, in which we try to put homeless people to work for free of charge to any business or landlord who is willing to go into the fight of affordable housing and solve this homeless issue.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For the city to adopt a resolution in support of the Martin versus Boise will be damaging to the city's reputation of being a leader in the homeless fight. I say that because as a resident of the city and in being homeless in this city, I know firsthand that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There is a criminal element that is put on homeless people because they're sleeping in public. If we, the courts say that homeless people or people sleep is a natural phenomenon. If we fall asleep in public, then we're all guilty of and we all need to be cited and go to jail, just like they do right here in'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They've been doing this for years, and a lot of homeless.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'People don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trust.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Any offer of help from the city of Long Beach because they believe that if they go into the multi-service center, they're going to be cited in arrested for being homeless. That is counterproductive to what you're trying to establish as a city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So for YouTube to support that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That resolution will be counterproductive to what you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Very counterproductive. You got people out here just working day in and day out, trying to do something to help alleviate this problem. And the problem is, is that not all homeless people have mental health issues. Not all of them is lazy and not all of them is uneducated.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Many of those educated, many of them work for free. On a daily basis just to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Change the hearts and.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Minds of people in this city. Because I know firsthand that a lot of gang leaders in this city didn't get this message, would they, getting from city hall exterminate the homeless? It's an American right to be protected, but for our possessions and be protected by the government in which we're under.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And only place that we can find is protection that is on public land, because will we sleep in public and private land? The gang members are going to find this and they're going to do exactly what they've been doing, stabbing us and shooting us.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'While we're sleep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. First, I would like to begin by sharing an excerpt from an article entitled Formerly Homeless MSW Alumna Giving Back to Ella's Homeless Katie J. MSW Class of 2016 experienced homelessness as a child. She now helps the homeless find permanent housing and access to mental health services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A Bay Area native. Katie did not have a traditional journey to the U.S.. Suzanne to work pick school of social work at the her parents divorce. Katie lived with her mother at the age of ten. They were evicted from their home, forcing Katie to sleep on couches and bounced between several homeless shelters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Finally, at 16, she was taken in by an aunt in Oakland. Despite attending 32 different schools, Katie received her high school diploma in 2003. Thanks to help from the East Bay College Fund. She went on to college and eventually pursued her master of social work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Katie spoke with us about her experience as a homeless youth and survivor of domestic violence, how she came to USC and her current work as a downtown Los Angeles emergency shelter. I say that because as an advocate and as a social worker practitioner, I stand before you in support of the entire homeless population community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The majority of the clients who sleep on the street are my current and former homeless clients. Shortly after this article was published in December 2017, I myself was forced into homelessness for doing what I was trying to do as a social worker practitioner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My daughter and I lost my residence of seven years where I relocated to Los Angeles from the Bay Area. During this time of homelessness, I myself had to sleep on the street as well as in my vehicle. I stand before you in support of my colleagues to oppose this ban?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The homeless clients that we serve. They need the support of the county and the state to help them move forward, to become successful, to become a success story like myself. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment. We're going to go ahead and go to a vote. And let's just count on one place to do everything else you comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First of all, I want to thank everyone who came out tonight and taking time out of your schedule to be here. Just a few things here. Public camping is illegal in the city of Long Beach. If we want to change the law and we want to have a discussion about whether it should be illegal or not, that's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a conversation that we should have. And I encourage my colleagues who are opposed to this item to bring such a discussion forward. I don't believe that my personally I don't believe that people should be able to sleep in public places when those spaces are closed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The reason for that is because residents also want to use the parks and or the beaches, and we don't have the resources to clean up these public spaces from encampments and do a sweep for public health impacts or threats every morning before kids and parents go to the park or to the beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The police should be able to enforce the laws as they exist. If we don't agree with the laws, then we as a city council have the power to change those laws. But unfortunately, in the five years that I've been here, I've heard a lot of support for our police officers not enforcing the law.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But not once have I heard a council colleague bring an item to say this particular conduct shouldn't be illegal at all. Right now it is illegal and our police officers are not able to enforce the laws that exist on our books today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They are in a difficult spot. When we have it is not illegal to be homeless. Absolutely not. And the city should do everything in its power to help support our homeless community. We should offer services. We should offer housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should offer as our quality of life division does in the East Division. They bring people to the courthouse that I supervise. And Mr. Stephan knows this. I don't know where he went. I actually walk those individuals into court and I have the judge recall their warrants so that the quality of life officers can drive them to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a facility so they can start rehab. I've done that probably about ten or 15 times so far, and that's something that gives people an opportunity to move forward. But it's because of their warrants that they can't get in the system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're not being arrested on those warrants by our quality of life officers. They're having those warrants recalled. If you don't leave or accept services and it's illegal to be in a particular place, you should be cited and you should be given the opportunity to accept the services that the city provides.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Living in a public space is illegal because the very things associated with living can cause unintended dangers. When bathrooms are closed, the only place where human feces can go is on the public space. When we don't have access to areas where people can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Relieve themselves. It impacts neighborhoods unintentionally, but it does impact neighborhoods. If people are using drugs. Not that all homeless individuals do, but if people are using drugs, there is always a risk of needles being left behind or drug residue being left behind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We recently had an incident where pets were being rushed to the emergency room because they had consumed methamphetamine that had been left behind in an area where there was a homeless encampment. So there are a lot of public health dangers and risks associated with camping and public property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city does not have the resources to clean those areas as efficiently as I wish we could. I think some of the controversy that has been stirred up as a result of this discussion and certainly was the subject of the L.A. County discussions, is exactly the reason why we need the Supreme Court to clarify this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Every city is dealing with this issue, which is why multiple cities and multiple jurisdictions have signed on to file the amicus. We are not joining in the amicus. We're just passing a resolution to support our colleagues in L.A. County who have weighed in on this issue because of the impacts that they've seen throughout the county.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I ask my colleagues to support this item, and again, I urge my colleagues who are opposed to this item. If you don't think that camping in public parks when those parks are closed should be illegal. Please, let's have that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's not what tonight's item is about. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Vice Mayor Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. You know, I listen to my counsel wrestling with this item and it kind of gets me very close because the fact that, you know, we talk about public parks and things of that type, this is where most of my homeless people in my district, that's where they camp out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we don't have enough room to incarcerate these individuals because the fact that they're homeless. We know that we're in a crisis. But this crisis has to be where we have to take responsibility ourselves to help these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as much as I respect my colleagues with this, we have to find a way we know we in a crisis also. But to say to incarcerate someone because of a situation of being homeless, I can't go along with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know we are that. We are what we call we are the keepers of our city. We have to sit up and make decisions. And our decisions, I don't think, has to be in for any form of incarceration, because that's not what brought them to become homeless.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Homeless came about not because of them, you know, wanting to be homeless because of the fact that other issues came about to make them homeless. So now we're going to have to come with a situation where we can help these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know what those individual could be as individuals, you start losing a few paychecks and see what happened. So I'm just I just can't really go along with this as much as I you know, I respect my colleague and I hope we can come up with something even better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you very much. I want to, first of all, thank those who came out and commended every one of your your words were very heartfelt and taken seriously by this council member. So I want to just just say, Derrick, I've got your outreach on Messenger a couple of weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I look forward to following up on the conversation with you and certainly empathize and and feel that the stories. I think there's a lot of hypotheticals being thrown out here. And this is a resolution about an amicus brief on the Supreme Court that may go to the Supreme Court or may not be heard by the Supreme Court'",
        "'speaker_13': '. I've heard hypotheticals about people being incarcerated for being homeless. I don't think we've. Oh. Gotten there yet? I would have. And I did hear that, you know, Long Beach is making great strides. I know we're going to continue to make great strides.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I mean, there's nothing. Oh. In what's being proposed tonight that says that we're going to turn the course in terms of our, ah, our approach to homelessness. I think we are looking at a multi-pronged approach. I think we need to, to, ah, to be very, very assertive in terms of solving this, this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think Long Beach is also going to be very continue to be very compassionate when it comes to dealing with our population experiencing homelessness. I know our law enforcement officers are doing that. The city council has put forth resources to try to put public safety.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Officers and firefighters. Through our hard team and quality of life officers who are doing outreach on a daily basis and complimenting our health department outreach workers. I think it was noted. And I'm sorry I forget your name, but it was noted that it takes up to 17 contacts to bring somebody into services.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Right. And the way I look at this is that we should be using tools to you to bring that number down. Right. 17 contacts is too many times. But if somebody experiencing homelessness knows that, hey, you know what?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There is a carrot and a stick. You know, I might do better going into talking to somebody or going into a shelter and getting help. That is where we should be really working to motivate individuals to go toward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And so I don't see the harm here in supporting this amicus brief. Our county supervisor, Janice Hahn, is somebody who is extremely compassionate, somebody who's worked very diligently on this issue throughout her district. Mark Ridley-Thomas is somebody who I have a great deal of respect for.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'These individuals voted in support, right? They led the effort and they are leading voices, not just in the county but also in the state on this issue of homelessness. And and for that, I'm going to support this. Again, I think we need to have the tools.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think we need to have a multi-pronged approach. I don't support incarcerating anybody for being homeless. That's not what this proposes to do. I don't see that as going in that direction, and I don't think this council would support that type of activity or that type of action.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We're saying that we need to have more tools. We need to have a little bit more enforcement and and motivation for for individuals to get off the street and get into services. And that's one way that we're going to help solve this issue of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Turanga.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mary. You know, we had a discussion last week and we talked about the tools. We have the tools. And this what this abacus does basically is puts us on the level of trying to criminalize homelessness. I totally oppose that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would be. I will be opposing this resolution when I drive around the city, when I drive to L.A. or when I drive to Santa Ana. I see the big problems there. We don't have that here in Long Beach is one of those things where, like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we're trying to do here is trying to work with homeless people. I agree with Councilmember Austin. We have to have a multi-pronged approach. This approach right here is not part of that solution. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Price. And then we'll go to the vote.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Okay. So a couple of questions. Here are a couple of comments here. And I agree with Councilman Austin. I mean, the goal isn't to incarcerate anybody. For those of us who work in the criminal justice system, I cannot begin to tell you how many collaborative programs are available collaborative court programs, rehabilitation programs, mental'",
        "'speaker_6': 'health diversion programs. I, I have never seen somebody incarcerated and in my experience for like a trespass on a public property, the prosecution's office, I know there's a lot of misconceptions about what prosecutors do, but we work hand in hand with the public defenders on people that have homelessness issues to try to work with them on that'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The the point of this is that we shouldn't. It. If people are sleeping in public spaces, we should have tools as a city to be able to enforce our laws. Now. Most of the time that enforcement means a citation and a admonishment to the person that it's a public park and they can't be there if the individual'",
        "'speaker_6': 'happens to have warrants. There is a possibility that they would get arrested, but that's up to the discretion of the officer. And in that case, they would be taken to the Long Beach jail, where they would have the opportunity to interface with our jailhouse clinician and further get advice and guidance on options for rehabilitation and services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's all before any cases even presented to the district attorney's office for review. But I'm hearing from my colleagues and I understand where we're at as a counsel, I respect the fact that we may not all see this issue from the same perspective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's one of the things I love about our city. It's very diverse and we have different perspectives. What I'd like to do is instead of a resolution, the motion that I'd like to make is just to write a support letter as opposed to a resolution, because I think a support letter supporting L.A. County's vote is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'L.A. County's actions perhaps sits better with some council colleagues, and maybe not. Maybe that difference doesn't matter to them. But I would like to request that this item be a support letter as opposed to a resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Members, Castro voted to change this from a resolution to a support letter of the L.A. County action. Please cast your votes.'"
