        "'speaker_5': 'It seems to me that everybody who works there has a passion for what you do, and that's why so many of you have been working together for so long. It's unusual to see that kind of longevity in a workplace that was very that that was moving to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And every time I drive by the center, whether on the freeway or if I'm going to Westerly and happen to drive nearby, I, I think about that. I think about the dynamic through your leadership, Dolores, that you've created there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But just sometimes when you try to put people in a workplace that they don't have passion for who they're working for or what they're doing, it's just not a good fit. And you guys have created such a great fit, which speaks so much to the service that you provide, the folks that seek you out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just everyone there cares from the heart. So thank you for everything that you do day in and day out. And thank you also for educating us on the wide number of services that you provide to folks who are disabled and others who are maybe going through addiction issues or economic issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that was eye opening for me. I did not know the breadth of the services that you provide and all of the different folks that you touch through your work. So thank you very much for everything that you do.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mayor. I also want to thank Councilwoman Gonzales for allowing me. Inviting me to participate in this and this event. I also had the opportunity to visit the Civil Resource Center a few months back, and I was just simply amazed at all the wonderful work you do there, the state of the art technology that you have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and the state of the art resources that you provide for all your clients. I go out there and it's really amazing. I can remember way back in 1990 when the Disabilities Act first came into into effect, and there were very little resources available at that time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nobody knew what to do. And but you've hung in there. You've been in there throughout the whole course of it, and it has actually grown to get to where you're at with the state of the art. I want to thank you for your service and thank you for staying in Long Beach and doing the work that you'",

        "'speaker_1': 'How difficult would it be to add voice boxes to the crosswalks so that those who are seeing impaired could go across the street? How how difficult would that be? What grants are available nationally to see that these people are able to cross the street by themselves without someone assisting them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This particular young lady I met her seeing eye dog died. And so she was having to get a new one. And and we sat and discussed for quite a few minutes that just to have voice boxes at the crosswalks for those who cannot see would be a great service to those who are seeing impaired.'",

That dispensary has since been closed for approaching two years now. Yet for some reason, this denial of this license for all sales continues to be a vestige of a left over issue'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that doesn't even involve all case, but rather involves the landlord for the building that all six rents. All the owners of all six fine pastries were unaware of this issue. They are not they did not even come to own the business, nor come to rent the property until long after the dispensary was removed.'",

Unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in. I do have a couple of clarifying questions before I make my motion and recommendation, and that is to staff regarding the what has been'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So when was the transaction to sell the property?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We received the application or the first notice that we were aware, and a new operator was looking to operate that bakery on July six, 2016.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And the the fines on the property permits win. And up until what point?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The fines on the property. Sorry. The fines on the property started on March 13, 2012 and ended on August 9th, 2014.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the the property owner missed their no, I believe his name is was the owner of I'll say Lorraine during that period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the property turn switched ownership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The property owner is still the same person, but the bakery business. A new application was received for the bakery.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, so the what's before us is a recommendation to deny the business license and application submitted by the the the business all, says Lorraine Fine pastries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'That's a mistake.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, hold on. Actually, sir, that that's not the way it works.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think there has been outreaches by the city to the property owner to resolve the the leans. As of January 5th, June 15th, there are eight liens against the property of $604,000 with penalties and interest is currently over $1.1 million and there's been no substantial offer or issued to resolve those.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think. Did you say that the city has made offers?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. The city has indicated a willingness to discuss it, but we have not received any kind of offer to resolve those lines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Well, I'm a little bit challenged by that. I will just say that I am I'm aware of this this property, this location. It is definitely created a great deal of consternation in my district for during a period of time in question here, where the property owner was fined.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On several occasions, I've had no opportunity to to meet the property owner or to be in any conversation whatsoever with him about this matter. I'm concerned that there, um, there hasn't been a willingness of the property owner, at least what has been represented to us here today to enter into some sort of settlement negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But, you know, I think in in good faith, in spirit, because this is this is a very, very serious decision before the city council. I would recommend and I'd like to make a motion that we continue this item for 30 days and allow such a conversation to be had, or at least open the door for that and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'come back and see where we are on this. So that's my emotion.'",

So close public comments on the hearing. And let me go back to the council for any other comments or discussions.'",
