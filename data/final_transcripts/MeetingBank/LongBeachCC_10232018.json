        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Now I'm going to go back because I have to leave. Can I move that up?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Unless. Objection of the council. Yes, the chair can move the calendar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The projection. Okay. Please come up. Item number 40, she believes item.'",

Read the first time and later What to do next. Regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading Citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a member first instance. Could I have a second, please? Fine. Okay. Yesterday. Any comments on this item? Public comment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wanted to make a few changes to the proposed ordinance, if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public can you want? Well, we'll let you go, that's for sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That way they can comment on the proposed budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For that purpose. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Very much. So there's just a few clarifying changes I would like to make, and I'm asking that through the process of inter delineation that we make the following changes on page one, subsection f. Hotel employer means a person who owns controls and or operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach and ask that everything after the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'word beach be deleted as not necessary. Under on page two. Item 5.54.030. Subsection A. I would ask that we add on the first section there, a hotel employer shall provide a panic button to each hotel employee assigned to work in a guest room without other employees present.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Regardless of job classification and at no cost to the hotel employee, it is recognized that b I would like to add it is recognized that because of the varying size and physical layout of each hotel, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then to resume the rest of the paragraph under sub b. I'd like to add, after the hotel, employer must allow guests room doors to be left open during cleaning. I'd like to add nothing herein shall prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Room door closed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit. Under item B sub two a I'd like to add. After the word behavior for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel. Under Section 5.54.040. On page two of three, I'd like to remove the word immediately.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The chapter shall be brought into full compliance with provisions of this chapter. And I'd like to add, not later than six months following the effective date of this chapter, to allow compliance by hotels of all sizes. Those were my only changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So with that, thank you. Vice Mayor. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman Margo. No comment. Okay, Count Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can we is there public comment that we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can get when we go into that? Okay, fine. Could we have public comment on this item? You want to come and speak on it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening. My name is Gary Hetrick. I reside in the fourth district and I do have a few comments. I've actually got a letter on behalf of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Community that I'd like to read into the record.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I'm also on the steering committee of the Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Community. Community, excuse me, Honorable Vice Mayor, members of the City Council, Long Beach, City Attorney Charles Park. And on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'September 4th, our council members Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mungo Andrew Super. Now, Austin brought forward an item that directed the city attorney to draft a similar ordinance to measure WW, slated to be on the Long Beach November 2018 ballot. That includes a request for hotels to have safety panic buttons, but similarly ignores working conditions of workers by not limiting the square footage assigned to hotel workers'",
        "'speaker_12': '. We believe this creates a conflict of interest under the Political Reform Act. We have submitted a formal request to the Enforcement Division of the Fair Political Practice Commission for further investigation and clarification regarding the Long Beach City Council.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Item 8-0797 and its conflict of interests with the Long Beach Council item Agenda Item Resolution 8-0118. We believe that this undermines the efforts and hard work of major WW proponents 46,000 plus voters and residents of the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We are clear that these efforts are put forth to confuse voters to the advantage of hoteliers and opposition to the measure. Additionally, it should be noted that these same five council members who were the same ones who opposed similar previous motions brought forward in the past year advocating for these safety measures.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was made clear to us that we could not count on our city council to protect Long Beach hotel workers due to this measure. WW As set forth on August 17, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution 18 Dash 0118 for the placement of Measure WW on the November 2018 ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'WW, if approved by the voters, would require a hotel in the city of Long Beach. Of 50 or more rooms to supply hotel employees who work in guest rooms without hotel employees. Present with an electronic contact contact device for summoning unseen assistants and reporting threatening conduct absent from tonight's proposed ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'However, our measure WW provisions that hotels and business lobbying groups disagree with most venomously. The proposed ordinance does not include a proposed excuse me a provision requiring hotels to post a notice in guest rooms, advising guests that hotel employees have panic buttons and are protected under the law.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The proposed ordinance does not include protections against inhumane workloads or mandatory overtime. The proposed ordinance does not include robust enforcement and anti retaliation provisions that major WW does. Again, we believe this creates a conflict of interest under the Political Reform Act with grave concern.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. The aim of public comment on this item. And we move back to the diocese. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you. So I still have the same concerns as I did last time relative to timing the process. I spoke with Charlie today about legal implications that we had talked about. And you'd met and I was on the in the understanding that when we had brought this when this was brought forward last time, that we would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'receive a two from four some sort of memo that would talk whether it was no legal implications or legal implications, that it would at least address that question prior to this coming back. So can you address that city attorney?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'After our conversation, I'm been able to watch the entire tape because it went on for quite a bit of time. But at some point, 7 hours and 42 minutes into the meeting, you had raised those questions. But the only report that was requested back at that time was the Economic Analysis Report.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I believe we had asked about the Political Reform Act, and I had indicated I had just received the proposed ordinance on the Friday before and had not done any research on it. But I, I didn't know that there was a request for a two from four and I didn't see that in the in looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I asked Linda in my office to also look at the tape. If we missed that, I apologize. But we did not provide it to from four. We did do the legal research. We do not believe that this proposal before you this evening is any way illegal or that the council is prohibited from moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If it wishes to do that tonight, it does not violate the Political Reform Act. We did receive one letter from the law firm Democrat and Stamper and Hillsborough. We had two different conference calls with them, with their research analysts, their general counsel, and their outside counsel on September 7th and on September 19th, where we discussed in detail'",
        "'speaker_13': 'their letter and why we did not believe that it supported the conclusion that the Council could not move forward with that. So we did our own research on this and we believe that it is if both measures, if this is adopted and WW is adopted by the voters, they can coexist.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It does not conflict if one passes and the other doesn't. Obviously then the other one could go forward. So with that said, we believe that if council wishes to move forward with this ordinance this evening, they can do so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. So I would like to I'm still I have a lot of questions. And I think another major topic that was brought forward was outreach to the motels that I don't believe has been done. I've connected with a few motels in my district and they've not even heard of this ordinance whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so with that said, I'd like to make a motion for a substitute motion for a received file of this and for us to get additional information back, whether that's the legal implications in a two from four and then maybe even I'd like to hear from my colleagues as to what they'd like to do in terms of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the business outreach and then even a fiscal impact study on this, as we talked about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I think I still have the same concerns. As we previously had. I think that I did outreach to my businesses as well and received an email today that said that there had been no outreach done. So I'm curious from city manager, you know, as we stated the first time this came up, we did four years of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'outreach with big hotels that are very different from hotels of 50 rooms or less. And I feel very uncomfortable with continuing to move forward with an ordinance not, you know, a study, but an ordinance today that would dictate something for those hotels.'",
        "'speaker_8': '50 rooms are lost. So can somebody clarify where we're at with that community process?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm not sure that we were directed to do a committee process that the staff level for hotels under 50.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had about a 30 minute conversation about it last time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't recall.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, I support the substitute motion on the floor. I think my position stands the same as previously. You know, approving of this ordinance today. I'm not comfortable with the fact that there's an OPC, you know, request for investigation on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not comfortable with the fact that our vote has already been used to politicize something that's on WW, which is what we said would happen. There's already a mail piece that's out there that's paid for by the chamber that's trying to interfere with something.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is not appropriate for us to be voting on this before the election. I'm all for waiting and getting some more information and engaging with constituents and businesses. I think that that is the responsible thing as elected officials to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I support this substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Councilman Richardson, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So so we had a long back and forth about the process and not what we landed on was that this will come back after we conduct the public outreach. And I believe it was Councilwoman Mango's motion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I, I, I offered a friendly to say no outreach during the election period, simply so that, you know, simply so that we maintain the integrity of the election that was happening. And then Councilwoman Mongo accepted that friendly and then I went back and watched the earlier today and that's exactly what happened.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So, Mr. City attorney what what how did how is this in front of us today?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Council member and members of the Council. I do not recall the direction to do public outreach prior to bring this back. There was a discussion with the mayor myself on that. This may come back. They were asked within 30 days and my recollection was there was discussion and I think John Keisler was talking about the study, the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'economic impact of that study and how whether they would be studying hotels with only 50 rooms or more. And I believe he said in the tape that the study may have some hotels in it with less than 50 rooms.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So some of that impact analysis may be applicable. May not? I, I don't recall, but I do not recall any direction from the council that prior to bringing this ordinance back, that some sort of outreach and report be presented to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That to me, that wasn't clear in the motion and on the vote. Five oh to bring this back to city council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there was a bit of comment or back and forth about how long it would take you to bring this back. I believe he said something like, you know, 6 to 8 weeks it would take to bring this back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then we had a conversation about we had a conversation about outreach and a number of councilmembers expressed their concern about, hey, this is very different than WWE because it impacts a lot of smaller businesses. And in general, I don't think people would have a problem with, hey, if this is the direction the voters want to go or'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the council wants to go. Sure, implement it citywide. But we should have a conversation with small businesses. And a lot of questions were raised about just, frankly, the political nature of this, given that there's an election, you know, two weeks from now with Major WW And already I received over the weekend a mail piece stating that the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'city council already has an ordinance on panic buttons. So this is the timing of this is exactly what we talked about. Political. It's political. And if we really want to do it, this is a sin. Since a sincere effort, then what we should do is do what the motion what my understanding of the motion was, and we'",
        "'speaker_11': 'can talk about that offline again. But my understanding was we are going to do outreach to the small businesses and we were going to begin the outreach after the election has come and gone and so and so and so that would be my sub so that we go back to what the original Y understanding was and if'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that wasn't what was what the motion was, if I misunderstood, if I have a misunderstanding, then that's what I would offer to the full council today that no, I don't think that we should receive a file. I think there's a lot of merit to the proposal, but it should happen after we've conducted outreach and that outreach should'",
        "'speaker_11': 'be in after the election period. And when I and to be more specific outreach to and there are there are groups that represent these smaller motels I know because they engaged with us when we initially talked about cracking down on nuisance motels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so there are groups of stakeholders that probably we know who they are because we're engaging on the conversation with the motels right now. So we should engage with those groups in small and maybe talk with the different council members about the smaller motels in their district about implementation plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think in general, in general, it may not take a very long time if we're already engaged in these people to say here's our rollout plan. But I think it should be I think we should do everything we can to be sincere about moving this forward without any appearance of this being politically motivated whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I am not making any implications to any city attorney, anybody on the council. I just think in an election season, that's when people are going to people going too soon. So my substitute substitute motion here is that we pick this up with outreach after the election period, a period of outreach to the small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then we bring that back and allow that to inform the crafting of this ordinance and bring that back to city council after that process has been concluded. And so that's my substitution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Danny in 1/2. Okay, fine. Yes, Councilman, you may know.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Vice mayor, many of the concerns that were raised during the first discussion of this really raised eyebrows, especially in the sense of that this was item was being fast tracked. It was presented as a supplemental item or a holiday.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then we discuss it on a Tuesday following the supplemental introduction of this item. There was a lot of discussion, as the city attorney pointed out, there was a seven hour discussion that went into well into the morning and a lot of things were probably missed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I don't blame either the city manager or the city attorney for probably missing some of those points that were made by Councilmembers Gonzales and Pierce in regards to doing outreach and getting a24 from Memo to the Council regarding some other background and some other discussions that we had that evening.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was a long night. And certainly reviewing the the video, you know, 7 hours, 7 hours the same. It's a full day of employment. So it's it very easily I could see where we could miss that. Or a lot of the questions that I had then are still not answered.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this is incomplete staff work as I as as I see it. And it's not complete. It's still had to work to be done. I support the motion currently on the floor because we do need to wait and we do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This has been totally, completely politicized. Like we didn't want it to be in the first place. And yet here we are and there's probably some more hit pieces out there talking about the city. You know Mr. Good. Mean the the problem is is that when you put a part of an item on supplemental.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's it's supposed to be something that's going to be well looked at. It's going to be studied. It's going to be properly reviewed and presented. And this item was not. And so I my position stands and I will be supporting the substitute item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Congressman Young Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Vice Mayor. I'll keep my comments brief. As I know we have been going back and forth and debating this particular issue for now, well over a year. And this council and many members of this council have come under serious criticism from various organizations for not moving quick enough on this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't necessarily see this as a politicized issue. I'm going to be very quick when I do see it. It has been politicized. But in terms of this ordinance, this ordinance, I think reflects the will of this entire council, and that is to provide greater protections to the women in the hotel industry.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And whether or not what happens on a ballot in a couple of weeks, this issue will provide an assurance that greater protections will will happen for for women who work in hotels, for any employees who work in our hotels in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I don't think I want to support the substitute motions. And for that reason, I won't. But I do have a question for the the the maker here Councilmember Price you in one of your your amendments to your original motion you struck the word from 5.54040.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Any hotel containing 50 or more guests were suites rooms operating under existing business license. On the effective date of this chapter shall immediately be brought into full compliance with the chapter. You changed that to six months. Can you explain why?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. I did that to be consistent with our desire to have outreach, similar to what we did with the Styrofoam ban to give smaller businesses or hotels the opportunity to win, get educated, and then figure out because the cost is going to have to be borne by the motel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they'll have to figure out what the costs are going to be an address to the ordinance. So that was the point of it to roll out implementation for the motels.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it was actually to do the outreach that's being recommended.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, because we don't currently have an ordinance to outreach to them on. But once we do, we'll have they'll have six months to get into compliance with the requirement that they have panic buttons and they'll have to evaluate what the fiscal impact is going to be for their own business, depending on the number of employees they have'",
        "'speaker_7': ', that it's a broader category than just housekeepers pursuant to the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Well, thank you for that clarification. I was concerned about the shift from immediately to six months, but understanding the reasoning and then hearing comments from our colleagues, I think that makes good sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Congresswoman Press?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Could the city attorney read the changes again? I was trying to find the ordinance. You were making changes? There were a number of them.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, I can. The the first changes in 5.54.020 definitions and subsection F and the new language reads as follows Hotel employer. That means a person who owns controls and or operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach, period.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The remainder of that definition is stricken. The next change is found at 5.54030. Subsection A After the first sentence, a new sentence is added that reads It is recognized that because of varying size and physical layout of each hotel comma, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels, period.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The next change is added at 5.54030. Paragraph B, subsection one. A new sentence is added. Nothing here in shall prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest room door closed during cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The next change is in that same section at paragraph two. Small a at the end of that sentence, they add the language for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel. Subsection 5.54040 Application to existing hotels.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That first sentence strikes the word immediately and adds so that it reads I'm sorry. So that it reads any hotel containing 50 or more guest rooms or rooms operating under the existing business license on the effective date of this chapter shall be brought into compliance for compliance with the provisions of this chapter not later than six months'",
        "'speaker_13': 'following the effective date of this chapter. And that would conclude those reports. I would add that on that last change, if WW were to pass, as a number of people have said here, WW would take precedent over this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So anything that is in WW or is more restrictive as to the 50 or more hotels, that would be the applicable law as to the 50 or more hotels.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Those I think those are my questions right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, counsel. Come to us and you through our council. Okay, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay, Mr. Attorney, going back to. So if we have a conflict that I believe one thing was voted on, but what was presented is something very different. What is what is the process to resolve that conflict?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The you could do a motion at the evening of the meeting where the vote was five. Oh, you could have done a motion to reconsider that matter. No, I mean, that time has passed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If the process let me be more clear, if the process that I believe was voted on, if there's a conflict on how we interpret what happened, is there a path or a process to reconcile that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You could do a motion to rescind the previous action by the city council to reflect any changes the item and and or when you approve the minutes from that previous council meeting you could say that there's an error in the minutes or there was an error in the in the in the minutes as prepared.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And you could do a motion to rescind the previous action by the city council and clarify it. Or you could clarify if you believe it was an error in the minutes of what was actually voted on. You could have that could be clarified at that time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that we are here today.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There's nothing you could you could put an item on the agenda to do to rescind the action taken on September 4th, or, as you've done in a subject, one of the substitute motions to receive and file this current item.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And at that point, you're free to start again. You really haven't taken any action on the ordinance itself.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Hmm. So really, there's no path beyond relitigating the conversation through re agenda, izing a motion to rescind that action. If we believe that what you have interpreted and what you've prepared is not consistent with the path that I thought the council voted on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's the only path to reconcile it?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. It's a policy decision for the council that if what we brought before you and what you have before you this evening is not what you asked for, then you can vote to send us back, to change it, to receive and file it to do whatever it is you'd like to do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Next question is there. So in crafting this ordinance, was this done internally or was this was this was a consultant hired on this? How was this crafted?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This was done by one of the attorneys in my office. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it was crafted internally. Was any language in this ordinance lifted from the ordinances on the ballot?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The answer to that is yes. We tried to, in the definitions and in the body of the language, to look at the proposed measure that is on the ballot, so that in the event that both of these passed, we could be consistent with our interpretation and and with the operation of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Was has industry at all at any level of the industry? Have they been consulted on this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have had conversations with, yes, hotel representatives. And as I mentioned earlier, individuals from Unite here and their law firm.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. So. And when did that outreach take place?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As I indicated, we got a we received a letter from the law firm. The date of the letter is. September 12th. And on September we had a meeting with them on actually September 7th before their letter. And on September 19th after their letter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So September 12th and September 19th. And then this was crafted in those subsequent weeks, obviously to be be placed on the agenda. So this was had to be completed and then go through a review process and and then the noticing to go on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. We because of the meeting was dark last week. It probably would have been ready for last week, but we weren't ready before that time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So this was drafted in about two weeks then. If we were we spoke with them about a month ago. This was drafted in two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yeah. The ordinance had been drafted and was being reviewed. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So how long does it normally take to craft ordinances of its nature?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's impossible to answer. Tell me what the ordinance the marijuana ordinance took as years. Other ordinances take us a week.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. I mean, this is like lightning speed. I mean, I've never seen an ordinance. And this.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This ordinance is almost.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And this ordinance isn't that complicated. And it's four pages.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, well, I don't know. I think, you know, we worked on a motel ordinance for human trafficking and conversions and all that, and it's been it's been well over a year, and I haven't seen an ordinance come back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It just it just seems to me that this came came it was developed fairly quickly. And I really wonder what the urgency was, because I didn't hear any motion, anything, any language in the motion that said expedite.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Actually, there was conversation during the meeting between the mayor and there was an expectation that this would come back within 30 days. And I was saying I didn't know whether we could do it within 30 days. It's now 49 days after the request to prepare.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there was also conversation about waiting until we had outreach done after the election cycle. So how do we determine which comments we include and how we consider what we receive from the council and which comments we don't?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The comments that were made, if they're not part of the motion, they remain comments and questions unless there is a direct request for that to be included or to be part of the motion. So while there was, as I think Councilmember Urunga mentioned, there was extended discussion on this item.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I believe at the end of the day, the motion that passed five zero was to bring this back and there was no at least I wasn't aware and I wouldn't be doing the outreach study anyway, but I didn't hear that as part of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And if I missed it, I apologize. But I certainly did not hear that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You have a copy of the motion. Is that available?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, it was a second substitute motion was made by Councilmember Mongeau, seconded by Councilmember Price to approve the recommendation as amended with a one year implementation period and remove recommendation for the motion carried by the following vote. Price.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Supernormal Mungo Andrews and Austin. Yes. Absent Gonzales, Pierce, Suranga and Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there was so there was no no direction in that motion to expedite it and have it done in two weeks then.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I just read the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And then so in terms of in terms of the ordinance that's here and then what's going on the ballot in November in general, would you say that it's better or worse to have a little bit more time to see what the rules of the lay of the land or the law of the land is?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If that if that happens in two weeks, we know with the law of the land. Is this the process you prefer to move forward? You know, in general is our city attorney is our elected city attorney. I would like for you to have a you know, a position on how you'd prefer our laws of our city to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'be created. And it just seems that this has been rushed a bit. And I just wonder if you didn't have direction from the council to expedite. Is this what you prefer to do?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There's a lot of things probably I don't prefer to do, but this isn't this isn't this isn't political on my part. I was asked to prepare a motion. I an ordinance. I prepare the ordinance and brought it back if if there's the will of the council to adopt it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The timing of that is I'm not going to play games on the clock. If it's ready, I bring it back. If I could point out that one of the motions made that evening, but then there was a second substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The substitute motion was to spend 60 days doing outreach, feasibility study for hotels under 50 rooms and request city attorney to use language currently in WWE and apply it to hotels under 50 rooms. That motion was made by Pearce, Councilmember Pearce and seconded by Councilmember Urunga.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That motion failed. The substitute substitute motion was what was passed. So there was no request for outreach in the substitute substitute.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And so my next question. Councilwoman Price, is there a copy of all those editions? There were. I tried with my highlighter when he read them off to try to keep up, but they came out pretty quick. Is there a copy, though, somewhere?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No. The amendment? Yeah. Is there. Is it written anywhere? I'd like to. Okay. So I'm going to say I'm sorry I missed I missed probably the first few. So unless you want to like. Maybe we go through them again.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd like to actually.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Share that always some additional time. Why not?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. Well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then you can tell us some stories. Anything. Let's do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So what was the first one?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the question would be directed to the city of Fallujah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what was the first one? The first I missed like the first three when you read them on.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The first change that I have in. Is that under section 5.54020 definitions, paragraph F Hotel employer. The new language will read Hotel Employer means a person who owns controls and or operator of a hotel in the city of Long Beach, period.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The remainder of that definition to be stricken.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Why was it why? Why was it included and why was it stricken? Was the impetus for that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I have no idea. He'll have to ask the maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Miss Price.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry. Councilman Richardson. You cannot ask me questions as if I am your witness in a case that's not pursuant to Robert's Rules of Order. It is, if you'd like to vote, if.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The chair would like to allow it. Okay, so I'm going to ask you to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Vote against it if you don't understand it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I'd have an opportunity to discuss it if the counts will be reasonable enough for us to have some time to actually deal with this. But we have to deal with it tonight. We're going to go through that grueling process of dealing with it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So so what it said was hotel employer means anyone who owns controls and operates a hotel in the city of Long Beach. But it struck out or a person who owns controls or operates any contract leased or sublet premises in connect to or operated injunction with the hotel's purpose or person, other than that hotel employee'",
        "'speaker_11': 'who provides services at that hotel. That seems like a lot of legal clarification. And what I don't want to do is strike it. If that somehow creates a loophole for people to somehow say that this doesn't apply to me as a hotel employer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So maybe, maybe, maybe one way to go about this is why was that extra language included? Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That language was included to include subcontractors, and it's similar, if not identical, to the language that is in W.W..'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So that that's language that came from WWE. Okay. Could it be in a situation where there's that would create a conflict between WWE on this if both of them passed?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What was the next one?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The next added a sentence and per in subsection 5.540300. Paragraph A. After the first sentence, the sentence that is added reads as follows. It is recognized that because of varying size and physical layout of each hotel comma, different devices may be appropriate for different hotels, period.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what will be the impact legally from adding that line? What does that what does that mean? I mean, some. So that doesn't need to be the same panic button, same device at each hotel.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. That there would be some ability for the hotels to have whatever is appropriate for the different size and layout. So may have something more akin to a radio that wouldn't be applicable in other hotels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. Makes sense. So. Okay. That's good. What's the next one?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The next one is in the same section, paragraph bb1 adds the sentence. Nothing here in show prevent a hotel employee from voluntarily electing to keep a guest room door closed during cleaning as the hotel employee sees fit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. And. And that seems like it makes sense to me. I just wonder if this was some of the if this was motivated by any of the input from the the outreach or I just wonder if it if this is like informed by a hotel employees experience or is it the hotel employers preference?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm just curious. That's not something you can answer.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. But my interpretation of that is it does provide some flexibility for the hotel employee. If this is a room where there's it's directly accessible to the outside and they felt safer keeping a close, this would allow them to do it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So and and what was the next. I believe I have the next one. Can you remind me what the next one was?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes. The next one is in the same section, paragraph two. So A and that's since they're adding language at the end of that sentence to say for after or threatening behavior for the duration of any continued occupancy by the person at the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Further clarifying how long they could be reassigned.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Understood. Understood. Okay. And so and now a question for you about implementation. So this goes to a first reading than a second reading and then the process of improvement. What is your understanding on that process of implementation? Because you said in the last motion there was a year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Process. What does that actually look like?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, I think there's two questions in there. The first is, is that if this were to pass this evening, you would have the first reading. The next reading would occur at your next regularly scheduled council meeting, which I believe is in two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then 31 days after the mayor signs it, the ordinance would go into effect at that time based upon the change in language in 5.5 for the hotels, 50 or more would be brought into compliance. They would have six months to come into compliance with the effective date of the chapter, and those hotel rooms with 50 or'",
        "'speaker_13': 'less rooms would have up to 12 months to come into compliance with this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I understand that, but I'd like to amend my my motion to say that, like a like a two from four in addition to this, that outlines what that implementation looks like. And I'd like to understand if there is an opportunity to because we're going to be doing work with with nuisance motels in the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is there an opportunity to find some efficiencies in how we conduct outreach to the small to the small, you know, small operators? Because if we're telling them, hey, we have a vision for what a modern motel looks like in our city, it should be consistent with our safety standards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I consider this a safety standard as well as all of our nuisance abatement, anti-human trafficking standards, all those things we're already engaging on so well. So what would be the proper way to do that? Should we just include it in the motion to include a two from four?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or is there some additional work that needs to be done to make sure that those efforts are aligned in some way?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, I think you could request the city manager, whoever this will be assigned to for implementation of this ordinance, would then be charged with notification and letting these folks know that this new law has been passed by the Council and business license could do outreach and and discussions with them.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think they already do so. And there's the task force that talks about the hotel issues that you mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Who who would take the would which department would take the lead on this outreach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So if this is a change in operation of a business, this would likely be a notification from business licensing as to a change in status.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Understood. And the last thing I'll say is it seems like the motion in front of us, it seems like the motion in front of us says that we vote on this tonight. And then in two weeks we have the second reading and then a month for the mayor to to sign it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the outreach would be would begin.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I'm sorry, correction. The motion that's before me right now is a substitute substitute on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I understand. And then the substitute substitute would say essentially that that process would just be pushed back for two weeks. So they're relatively the same, with the exception of what I just added about outlining that process. So so frankly, they seem very similar to me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they seem very similar to me. The motions now they've been explained.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, please, Councilwoman Rice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, thank you. Councilmember Richardson and I do it while you read me the the changes. I do appreciate some of the questions that were asked. And it reminded me of some of the other questions that I wanted to follow through on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It looks like by reading the ordinance that it does include subcontractor workers. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'City attorney does not at this time as amended.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And I know I'm not putting you on trial, Councilmember Price, but I do want to ask if there's a reason for not including subcontracted workers, because we know that that is a very large percentage of employees in the hotel industry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think I've made my amendments clear. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So I will just note that many hotels in our city use subcontracted workers for entire departments, sometimes housekeeping. And so while we could pass this and we could pat ourselves on the back and say we passed something, if a hotel has an entire department that has subcontracted housekeepers, like many of the hotels in the city, we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are actually not doing what we will say we will do. This also does not include the retaliation part. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'City Attorney That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So I will be brief in saying that we can arm our housekeepers with panic buttons, but if they use them and they get retaliated against, they are no use to them. One of the conversations that we have had many times is Why do women not speak out?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why do women not break their silence? Why do housekeepers not go to their bosses and is because they do not have protection from retaliation? And that is something we have seen in our hotels in the city. So, again, we can pass this ordinance tonight, but if there's not a protection for retaliation, we are not doing our housekeepers'",
        "'speaker_8': 'any good. I have two other questions, particularly around public records request. What's the city's policy on Paris? What's the timeline that we typically get those back?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So each period is different.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The statutory requirement is that we respond within ten days of whether or not there are documents to produce. We had the ability to ask for an extension to determine whether or not there are documents that are available to produce, and then the peer statute says you have a reasonable amount of time to produce those.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So some things go very quickly. If it's an easily identified document, we find it, we tell them we have it, and we sometimes produce it all within those ten days. Some praise take us months and months and months, if not years, to produce over a year, probably not several years, but at least over 12 months sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If not years, 12 months. Can you give me an example of a PR that would take 12 months if it's a PR about emails?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We got asked for any and all documents one time related to litigation on anything dealing with PCBs that the city has ever done and any water and and any data we have back to the 1930. So that took over a year, I'm guessing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So something along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So a letter came into my. To my attention that there was a PR done on September 7th in regards to this item with entities related to the Long Beach Area, Chamber of Commerce staff, affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Long Beach Police Department and Affiliates. California Hotel and Lodging Association. Its staff. Affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys. Long Beach Hospitality Alliance. Its top affiliates or agents including but not limited to attorneys. Any third party.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Any members of a Long Beach City staff, including city manager's office, city attorney's office and city clerk's office. How long do you think it will take for us to get that PR back before the people that requested this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't really have an estimate on time. So we get about 3500 press requests a year, and so staff do as best as we can to respond to each one of those periods. Some are quick, some take longer.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't have an estimate on that one. I'm not aware of that one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think that my points that I wanted to make tonight before this vote happened was that I do feel unlike some of my council colleagues that this is political and the fact that the timing is not being negotiated at all, the fact that we're not adding third parties that are in there is political.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The fact that there is not a retaliation clause is political. And I would love to know if in between the last time this council item came forward and now if we've had any conversations with the lobbyist or businesses that represent hotels of 15, 50 rooms or more as a an opportunity for them to use this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's very you know, I had hoped that reason would have allowed us to have this conversation after the election so that we could all feel better and we can make that clear to our constituents. And it's just pretty disheartening that we can't come together as a council to do something as simple as wait two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Comes from New England.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Mayor. At the beginning of this item here, the councilmember from the third district made some amendments to this ordinance. In the past, when we talked about amendments to any ordinances that would basically restart the clock. That is not the case in this situation here.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm sorry. I didn't. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In prior discussions with about ordinances, when we have an ordinance brought me before us either for our first or second reading and there were additions or changes made to that ordinance, it would basically trigger a restart or re discussion or new a new amendment coming in to the city council with these amended motions or changes to an'",
        "'speaker_12': 'ordinance. I don't hear that happening here. Is there a reason for that?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, Councilmember. And you are correct. When there is a substantive change that the public would not be aware of, then we would say that you have to start the clock over, start first, reading again. The item this evening and the changes, as I understand them, are in early delineations and changes to the language that exist so that'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the public is on notice of every said. There's no new sections being added. They're not changing the overall sections. They've changed some timing. But we believe these changes could be made this evening and you could have first reading this evening if the council so desires.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, so if today's a first reading, then they will come back to the city council at at a later date for a final adoption.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Who would come back for second reading? I believe it's the 13th. The workload dark next week and dark on the Tuesday for the election, so that following Tuesday it would come back to the council for second reading.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if we still had some concerns on the 13th about this ordinance, as there is worry with the changes and the amendments that are there, can we still introduce other concerns that we might want to add or make other changes to the ordinance at that time?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. The impact analysis, it is dated October 11th. And can we can someone walk through that? Because although it's it's discussing the hotel ordinance that is on the ballot, I think it's pertinent to this discussion overall because it it goes over the impact analysis economically for us here in Long Beach and then also goes through methodology.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'd like us to just sort of walk through that a bit and in our findings and all of that because it just came to us in a two from four version.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, I will do my best. So we if you remember, the city council requested to do a impact analysis and that the scope of which was sort of spelled out here on the council floor. And we did our best to implement that through a group called Bay Economics.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's somebody we have used in the past, as we have looked particularly about any hotel incentives to be able to bring high scale hotels into our city. And so the city council asked for it to be done in about 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That was at its August 7th meeting. We reported back at that 30 day mark about where we were and quickly engaged by it ended up taking us about.'",
        "'speaker_4': '60 days to do.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That was for the methodology. It was really turned over to Bay. We gave them the scope of work. They interviewed a number of stakeholders from large hotels, small hotels, medium hotels. It was really focused.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the measure.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It wasn't focused on this particular item, but rather on the initiative ordinance that was brought to us to both understand the the scope of it, the financial impact primarily to the city. In order to understand that financial impact, we needed to understand the impact of the various provisions on the hotels themselves.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I concluded that some of the provisions would have very little impact or no impact, and it has financial conclusions which were very difficult to put into real dollars, especially in the short term, but did have some conclusions about the potential impact on hotels that have not yet decided to be constructed in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'They're under the entitlement phase but have not pulled the trigger to actually begin construction. It interviewed some of the, you know, samples, and there were confidential interviews of small, medium and large hotels, as well as the CVB, as well as Unite Here for to be able to get labor perspective.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And finally, it looked at various other similar ordinances that were done in other cities to try to understand their experience of the implementation of the ordinance. And then that entirety of the report was presented to you and the public on October 11th via memo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. I appreciate you going over that a little bit. Okay. So with that and this is my main issue with this is that we we don't even have obviously WWE on the ballot. We didn't even have an ordinance that came back and we did a study which I think is fine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did that. It was very in-depth. It was a third party and now we have this motel ordinance in front of us with absolutely no study. No information, no economics. We don't know. No business outreach and different from the polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will make that distinction. We did do outreach with polystyrene. In fact, myself, I went with my office to every single business improvement district to talk about polystyrene. So there's a difference in that. In addition, and I want to ask our city attorney this question when when the when the polystyrene styrene ordinance came before us, I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'believe there were a few amendments that were to be made. I think that was on timing. And you had mentioned that it would start over the clock. So are you saying now the amendments made by council member. Price would not start the clock over.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If I recall correctly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Seems very there seemed very stark to not do that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If I recall correctly. I don't know what changes you're referring to on the polystyrene, so I don't have that in front of me. These changes and why we don't think they start the clock is it's it gives the hotels more time rather than less time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So it is it from that perspective, they have additional time to do that so that it's more favorable to the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we did that with polystyrene as well.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I believe that I'm not sure what we do with polystyrene. I don't have it for me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it was a I believe at one and it was a we I think we had like a one year period and then we moved it to 18 months. And that started. You said that. We would have to start over the clock.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that what I'm getting?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I don't recall. I have to go back and look at the minutes from that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So you're just saying now. So I just. So I'm clear. We're not starting over. She's going to go in first reading. Whatever happens tonight, they will move forward.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's correct. That this if the council approves this this evening, this would be first reading. Second reading would be November 13th. Additional changes could be made there that could start the clock over if additional changes are substantive and then depending on how the council decides to vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I think everything else has been mentioned. The last thing I will just continue to to harp on is the just impact analysis. And I don't know if there's been any thought about that. Knowing that this is going to be a major impact, whatever happens.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the election with the election or even aside from that? Okay. I had one other just clarification, because we didn't take a two thirds vote to rearrange this agenda item. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It doesn't require a two thirds vote to rearrange the agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thought it did because.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This does not take the council and the chair can change the agenda unless and I mentioned this prior to the start of this, unless there is objection from the council hearing.

But there's one great thing about this city, I think, that distinguishes us from many other cities, and that is our robust public participation process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I don't want to do anything to damage that. I think we have more civic participation, more. I mean, our council meetings are packed week after week after week. And so. But I do like the idea of looking at other public agencies and how meetings are run.'",

The city of L.A., other, larger, larger public agencies that don't have as much public participation, but still are managed and or comparable amount of public participation, but they manage to still run meetings efficiently.'",

This is sort of deja vu all over again because many years ago, the reason we have the meetings where we have them now and the structure we have right now is because of the concerns raised by the community in terms of the city council not being accessible about transparency.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Meetings were held during the day starting at 2:00 in the afternoon with hearings and committee meetings and and then starting the council meeting that at four, I think it was two or three in the afternoon. So we are here because of the review that was done before and this this this meeting that we have now a result'",
        "'speaker_12': 'of that. However, I am supportive of the fact that we should revisit where we're at. I mean, I can see time now to look at our efficiencies as we are currently so that we can make even more refinements.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But I think that anything that pushes meetings out or adds meetings or makes them even earlier to where the public is not going to have access to these meetings, I think would be, as you said, counter-intuitive. So let's keep that in mind as we move forward with this and looking forward to what the what results.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thanks for bringing this forward. Council Member Super. And I think it's a great item. Anything we can do to be more efficient. So a couple things that have not been mentioned is I'd like us to just think about in this research the the preplanning of holidays and days that we remove off of the the council calendar'",
        "'speaker_5': 'just because, you know, there's a lot that we're like, for instance, after the budget, we usually have a day off Thanksgiving, Christmas, so perhaps we could be a little bit more strategic and in how we're removing those off the council calendar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of course, we don't want to be here during Christmas or Thanksgiving, but the days surrounding that would be something to think about. And the only reason I think that the the group had put together an extra day like Dark Tuesday and I had to explain this to council member super not is because we have additional duties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So many of us are on committees, state, federal legislative housing committees, etc. study sessions that we have, charter amendments that we're going to do, a study session, etc., etc., etc.. And so that may be a good opportunity for us to use the Dark Tuesday for those specific meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's one thing I'll mention. Other than that, I think this is great and I look forward to it coming back. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember Longo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So just to kind of align with Councilmember Austin, I'm sorry, Councilmember Richardson's comments on the previous agenda item, there's always a lot of input from council members and that's great. But unless it's a component of the friendly amendment of what's being considered, I, I just wanted to kind of throw that in there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so while I appreciate the idea of a stop clock, I always appreciate staff's responses. But I know that kind of a component of a stop clock is also if I ask a question, how long does it take staff to respond?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that can be a part of the whole dialog. And so one of the other components could be perhaps a number of questions before reviewing. And I really appreciate the Dark Tuesday because when big items are coming, it's a way for community meetings to happen and for us to talk with the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's often difficult to get these chambers, as Councilman Gonzales said, for our committee meetings and our structures where we have the public coming in. And so I know that in looking to offer opportunities, it's great that anyone can come and speak for 3 minutes at the dais, but to have a real dialog with the community, there'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have to be dates for that. And one of the other dates that I would comment on is I know Councilmember Durango and I consistently want to be able to be able to be out in the community for neighborhood night out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our communities consistently ask us to be there. It's a time when they have the ability to ask questions that are already gathering. It's a national day, but yet every single year we have to struggle to either get it on an agenda and by then it's too late, or when we want to ask for it, we're not sure'",
        "'speaker_6': 'what the agenda might be and if there would be something time sensitive. And so I really appreciate this agenda item. And I think Councilmember Suber not for his step forward on this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. So just a few more thoughts. So one, I think another way. So if we say there's only so much PI, if it's 22 hours on average, we spend on and through three meetings we do have. And thank you for bringing it up.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The committees. The committees. I mean, we should take a real review at the committees. Which committees are not like how much work is on the docket in committees, how much stuff, how many people don't call or utilizar committees when they should?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. And if people utilize those committees, maybe they've set out some of their ideas. Or if we created the process that if there's a fiscal impact, it has a committee review first. It could it could potentially vet out some of the some of this work.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the council meetings are more are are less of a proving ground for new ideas, but rather we use it to to improve things. So that's something we could we could think about. Additionally, I'd like to just have a little more specificity on how we how we plan to engage the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So and I'm going to pose this the city staff since apparently. Well, first, let me ask, is there is it against Robert's rules or order any any process to for us to speak to the maker of the motion or ask for clarity or anything, and.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You're supposed to go through the chair. So you're not under rubber rules. You're supposed to ask the chair, and then it goes to the member of the committee. If you're not if the chair doesn't do that. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm going to ask city staff. So how would we I just want to and I don't want to belabor this, but I do want some clarity before I cast the vote today. How would we plan on actually getting input from the public on this before we make a decision?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, as the motion stands right now, we would do what staff would normally do, which is do some research. We would bring back a report and then that community input would really happen at the council stage. So we would certainly take community input.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We would be providing a menu of options and some recommendations. If you wanted to amend the motion to actually include a robust public outreach method, it could be anything from, you know, just having it will collect input from anybody or we'll have a survey or we could go out and do full blown meetings.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I think the more work you do, the longer the item would take.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sure. And and I think moving into the new building give us gives us roughly a year or a bit less. I would offer a friendly than that. We and I don't want to belabor it, but I want to actually have a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would like a meeting. And you should be inclusive of those those individuals who submitted the letter, as well as common cause because they've consulted our city before on good governance measures just to see if there's any ideas that the when the first time the council sees it, any good ideas that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I like the conversations about I like one idea, for example, that when you submit an agenda item. Excuse me, Councilmember. I just want to be able to speak clearly, make sure my ideas were recorded. So, you know, like, one idea I think is good is when an agenda item is placed on the agenda, there's a time request'",
        "'speaker_11': 'on how much time you're requesting for, for debate. I've seen other agendas do that, and it actually allows you to sort of predict how much time you're going to spend on it. Then the council gets to make a choice whether you want to spend, extend the debate or continue with what's approved sort of proposing the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's just a suggestion. So that's my friendly to the maker of the motion. Can we have as they conduct outreach, can they also meet with some of the community stakeholders in common cause?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think what I said previously, it was wide open for anyone to submit anything to city staff. Mr. Parkin, is there anything in my motion, this, my agenda item that would preclude the public from contacting you on this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There is in the motion, as I understand it. No, there is nothing that precludes the public from sending their comments or suggestions to city staff or to any of the council members or the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's a no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then it's a no.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Subs to motion the motion as written. That includes community part one meeting for community part partners, including Common Cause I myself through motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's been moved and seconded. Councilmember Mungo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did you call? Yes. I'm sorry. I appreciate the comments in my support of this item. One of the things that I think is really important is that there's an equal footing for anyone to have input. And one of the things that I would potentially encourage would be that perhaps the city clerk has a specific designation on emails'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that all come in related to it. I know that one of the challenges sometimes is we'll know what items coming two months out and people want to provide comment. However, until the items agenda is the e-com, it can't be there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so even with Councilmember Supernova's original motion, if people wanted to make that comment for it to really be filed into the record in the most efficient way, for us to aggregate that and give access to us as a council of what those comments are, because they feel like it's really important that we are able to read'",
        "'speaker_6': 'those when considering this item as it comes back in case staff does not fold that in. So what I'll do is I'll make a substitute substitute motion that we reach out to the community through insight will be Twitter and Facebook posts that let them know that the council is looking to better include the community in the dialogs'",
        "'speaker_6': 'related to council agenda items and provide an email address where all public comment could be gathered so that we as a council can have that as an aggregate provided digitally when the report comes back. That work. Great.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'm sorry that this second or. There goes the vice mayor. Not present.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's crazy.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the second will be by Councilmember Richardson. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Perfect. Trying to bring everyone together on one thing. So this is something the city clerk has done for us in the past when we know an agenda items coming, but we don't have the AECOM an option. And so I guess we would maybe say anyone who emails the city clerk with the subject line streamlining council meetings, all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of that would be aggregated so that we would all have that available to us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So we still have three councilmembers cued up in the interest of efficiency. We still have public comment on this item. Councilmember Arango.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, very briefly, I actually and this is part of the discussion that we're talking about at the super and I want Councilmember Super in Dialogs Alliance and that's good. However, I think that in addition to this, this built in efficiencies using Robert's rules for parliamentary procedure.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think that one of the things that we should be including in this is also a training, if you will, by my parliament, by certified parliamentarian and Robert's Rules of Orders and how you can use those to make a meeting much more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I think that none of us what I have, but many of us have not been officially trained or no Robert's Rules of Order. I mean, we I think a lot of us have been sort of learning parliamentary procedure as we go along, and people in the audience have been learning about Robert's Rules water.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And as we go along there and but nobody has actually received a training. Let me rephrase that again. I've taken it. But we need a parliamentarian to come in here and let us and actually show us through the ropes of using Robert's Rules of Order to make the meetings more efficient.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can train you, sir. Just kidding. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're doing a great job chairing the meeting. Councilmember Austin, by the way, I take training from you any day. I just want to concur with that. Is that the the process of us always asking the city attorney for tips on Robert's rules, I think is stalls us a lot of times.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I come from consensus building and grassroots organizing. We don't use Robert's rules. You know, I never chaired on a Democratic club or anything like that. I just I cued up not to make that comment. I queued up to say that the reason why I think it's important to highlight organizations that we want the staff to work'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with is not because not anybody can email the staff and ask to speak. It's because history shows that not everybody has been invited to be a seat at the table. As somebody that was working in nonprofits for ten years before being on this council, I know many times and we had asked to have a seat at the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'table and we didn't. And so that is why we ask for it. It's not because it's not accessible for somebody to send an email, but we there are people out there that work on this stuff that are experts and that engage with this council often.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that it's important that we include them. So I hope. Councilmember Super. Now that you will accept out that substitute motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great Council member supernova.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just want to direct everyone's attention to an item I placed on this item. That is the fiscal impact. We did the legwork on this. We went to city manager, city clerk and city attorney and asked about staff time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is something had been brought up in previous council meetings. So if we expand this item, I have to go back and ask staff if there is an impact on staff time. Otherwise, it's not the same item that the focus here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hate to call it narrow because it was wide open. Look at best practices anywhere, but it was did and did not include reaching out to the public. Okay. So I was saying that anyone can do this. But my question is basically going back to I was speaking to the substitute substitute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there an impact on staff time or a fiscal impact to add this item?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So for the substitute substitute motion, adding a inside Long Beach and doing some Facebook and social media that's, you know, can be done, you know, fairly easily.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've done that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'In the past. You put it out, that would be pretty low impact on staff. To put that question out, we would aggregate the responses and bring those back and those would help inform staff recommendations. Going beyond that to do meetings and others, that obviously is a little is a higher level of of work.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we believe from the substituted service to motion, we could accomplish that fairly easily.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So if the maker of the motion agrees to that, that I would support that, that there is no additional fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I really appreciate the comment because I'm very. I would want to send it to committee if it had an extended fiscal impact. And one of the reasons why I specifically talked about setting up the email address was I know that in prior times we can just click those select all turn into a PDF and you're talking about'",
        "'speaker_6': 'minimal stuff, time variance. And so I think that the fiscal impact would be as close as it could be to the original motion, and that was my intent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Public comment, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good. You click as the address. I support this 100%. The same way I support Councilperson Price and her positions on things. We do need efficiency and all we have to do is look back at what happened. A few dealing with the the hotel issue and the panic button.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of the people, particularly the one that doesn't know enough that you shouldn't fish off the company pier or the two council people from the eighth ninth district that the D that support the deviant. Snoop Dogg.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Clearly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Didn't don't do their jobs correctly. That whole debate we had on the discussion, the hours it took relative to the panic button at the council, people done their job. There would be no need for that lengthy discussion. You've got a staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You've got a telephone. All of that should have been worked out. Worked out publicly with your people. Then you bring it here. The public doesn't need, although it was very instructive to show how incompetent. The Councilperson for the second district and the two counsel to the council, Austin and Harrison.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are and should really be. Removed. If we want efficiency, you can set up all the rules. But when you have clowns like that, you're not going to get the efficiency. So I have clear confidence, as I said in the Council on Supernova and Super and Councilwoman Pryce as.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I've got great confidence in our vice mayor. I only wish. I only wish he would. If our mayor had the decency to recognize that his career is over and that by late spring he will be in prison, he should be resign now and let our good vice mayor take over for the balance of the year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it goes back to again the council. People have to do their own job. When you come here, you should have done all your homework. And you're not doing it. What you're doing. I do not. Well, I do know what you're doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you again. It's a commendable idea and it should be implemented. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just feel.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Good here. You had 20 seconds to spare.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank goodness. I'm Karen Reside, president of District one. I come frequently to the council on meetings. Thank you very much. Council member super north. This is long needed this discussion. One of the things that I really would like to recommend and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The previous speaker. I think it's an example of this. We limit the number of times that people can come up and speak and waste our time. That's really a critical issue for me. I, I believe that all the city employees and all the council members work really hard and they do the best that they can with the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tools that they have to work. I don't know if full time council can be on the table at this point in time, but I think that's something that our city is growing to the point where we really have to seriously look at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I believe education. Lots of people come to the council meetings and they don't know what to expect. There are some very limited instructions on the agenda. It doesn't help people understand what it is that they need to do in the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they get frustrated and upset because the council members or city staff can't answer their questions. They don't understand that's not allowed as part of the process. So people need to understand the process better. And really, I think there are better ways to put the lovely PowerPoint presentations that parking districts CVB.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All those presentations that take a large amount of time and have a large amount of staff in the audience, and I don't know if they're on the clock. I believe that those would be better if they were put on the website where people could view them at their leisure and it through their choice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I see a number of efficiencies. We look forward to the opportunities to submit comments and we'll have a have a discussion of it at the Gray Panther meeting. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Finally, these people. It's way more so again, why she's sitting there talking about limiting the times people could come up here. I don't understand why why we sit there listening to say the same thing over and over again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I feel like Yasha have a timer. We have a timer where we only get 3 minutes and some people don't even use theirs, which always sit there and linger over for 15 or 20 minutes, going ping pong back and forth and all this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's okay. Yea, the ones that waste the majority of our time which are comments or notions or do we do this? Can we do this? I don't know. That's your position. That's your chair. I just come here because I'm part of the community and I just want to know what's going on or different resources that pose'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to be out here to help me where I don't have to come cry to y'all about the issues I'm having are not in place. So if it was more structured and y'all will really manage them more and make sure that everybody is on top of their job, doing their job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But y'all could do your job. It'd be better. But just like y'all drag your feet, they get to drag their feet. They get to slip people underneath the rug. They get to push it to the side. In a way, y'all cancel city council meetings and then way then don't have one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So is a lot of things that can be changed or, you know, done differently. But it got to be some give and take. And Jackie bringing up all the new building. A new building. Yeah. And all of that sort of new building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I don't hear anything about the new park. I don't hear anything about how you guys are going to help all the thousands of homeless people. They used to at least get help at that part. I haven't heard one time y'all say anything about that part, but I heard John say building at their building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the building. At the building. That's it. It's not about the people. It's not about the community. It's just. Let's see how we going for Dangote is money. Let's go sell this property to this owner where they do a you know what, a gated community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the end, they had to pay $3 million to upgrade the park because you guys didn't have the funding. Their job was that every they wondered about the riverbed. Come on now. I do do my research and I do read and I'm very educated budget and saw a lot of people there is not even trying to know'",
        "'speaker_6': 'all this. I don't care about which I do. I'm a mother. I'm trying to be a mother. I'm not a politician.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a good.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. And I appreciate the robust conversation around this and look forward to it coming back in 90 days. Please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Misses the vote on the substitute substitute.'",

That we are not missing out on the opportunity to create good jobs, a stronger economy in our city, but also cleaning up our environment in a way that residents really have a choice and an option, which is something that in Long Beach we haven't really'",
        "'speaker_8': 'had. And so I'm not going to give the full presentation around why cars are the best model. I think that we're going to have a lot of community members that want to speak to that tonight. I did have some questions on timeline moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know that we had some questions around the end of the year. DEADLINE When do you think we're going to be able to get back some of the data that is required to meet that deadline?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What could you be more specific or the deadline?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I think that we were looking at a deadline of the end of the year that we had talked about getting our load data, the 15 minute interval load data. How long do you think that's going to take through our process?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The item here tonight seeks approval for the contracts. When the when the consultants get together, they would be able to provide that information to us as to if the data that we currently have received from Edison through our NDA is sufficient enough to move forward, or if they are going to if they really need that 15 minute'",
        "'speaker_4': 'interval data to conduct the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Aha. That is the question that I was looking for. Thank you very much. That is the answer. I hope that my constituents in the audience could hear. I think we should go to public comment and then hear from our council colleagues if we have any other questions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If that's okay with the chair.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's fine. Council Member Richardson. Are you okay with that public comment, please?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good. Quick as the address. I think this is a fantastic idea. As a matter of fact, you'll hear from this Templar of some new information that she brought to my attention. Recall, if you will, about a month or so ago, I suggested on the advice of Homer Simpson, one of my great sources of the concept of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'solar panels being put over the tennis court at Marina Vista Park, and then also capturing the energy of solar panels from the Peterson Rowing Center, as well as the as well as fire station 14 and the street lights leading up to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But then I started thinking a little bit more. And after talking to Homer and listening to this gentleman. We're really talking about a billion, billion dollar. Proposition. Our revenue stream about $1,000,000,000 to the city of Long Beach. Because every neighborhood, every corner, every street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As lights. Buildings had to have lights. Edison is not giving that money away, that electricity away. Somebody is paying the bill? No, unfortunately, in our set up, we don't know. I've tried to get a financial the financial service people, they don't know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who's paying the bills. But I think if we apply that. What I referenced before that one area like powering the electricity of fire station 14, the police, I mean, the lights and so forth, and extrapolate that through the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are really talking about a revenue stream that's got to be at least a billion. That's Beavis and Butthead. That is a lot of money. So other people will talk more cogently about it and with more, more detail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the, the I yeah, that idea just popped into my head this past week and so for the last few days. Give it a lot of thought because it is $1,000,000,000. It's a billion. A billion. They're not giving up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Edison's not giving it away. So we can harness that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you for that public comment. And I see quite a few people lined up in the spirit of our conversation here this evening. You have up to 3 minutes, but you don't need to use all 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understood, councilman. My name is Sarah Jones. I'm a District nine resident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm also a union electrician with IBEW 11 and also a journeyman. The vast majority of CCAS or more use more renewable energy. And are current utilities too. This means more projects and jobs and also cleaner air all in one package.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have had blackouts and Long Beach case will help address this. But the projects like battery storage and microgrids in order to stabilize our electric grid during the worst parts of summer. I seek and buy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Energy from this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As our project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are a plant which is creating good union jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On average, the rates at municipal utilities are 20% cheaper than our investor owned utilities. What does that tell you guys? Southern California Edison care about Long Beach. Do they care about the air quality along the 710 corridor, which is happened to be where I live?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do they care about local jobs or are they only bringing in their own people? Why should a huge utility decide what programs like feed in tariffs, energy efficiency, electric vehicle incentives? We should have local control.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also worked on the Blue Line upgrade a few years back. As a Long Beach resident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And a Long Beach worker. Thank you. I mean, my Clemson I'm a District four resident resident. I am the energy program manager at the Cal State Chances office. One of the projects we're working on right now is a K for higher education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's important to note that the keys are largely a solution that's actually kind of been solved, which is the integration of renewables into the electric grid. Edison's actually become one of the leading utilities in the country, having to install renewables and advanced battery technology.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For example, we've seen the power content, the carbon content of Edison Power reduce by 50% by from 2009 sales. To just a mention, though, that the renewables have changed the utility game. The current kind of idea is that you dispatch the load to follow the demand, but because of the variability of renewables, you have to you have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to reduce the use to address dispatch the demand of all follow the supply. A lawmaker can help facilitate that, but only if it's only if it's set up that way. One thing I think is important to note is that the state there are times when we have to export our power at a loss because there's so much'",
        "'speaker_4': 'solar on the grid that we can't use it. If we had a way to change the demand profile, then we'd be able to take advantage of that. One thing I think we shouldn't do is include whatever electricity operations in with the natural gas operations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The two are kind of at cross-purposes. And, you know, if you're trying to reduce emissions, that goal is not aligned with Long Beach gas. And I just want to mention how gas was recently found to be implementing or impeding the transition from natural gas to protected business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we can't allow that to happen here. This could include a small charge to drive emission reductions through energy efficiency or by displacing natural gas through electrification. This would make Long Beach K a leader in the utilities. This program doesn't exist anywhere else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's one to say the city can't just buy more renewable power and expect this to be make Long Beach a leader. I think there's a path forward with a K, but has to be intentional on reducing emissions, not just accounting for more renewables.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Next up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counsel. My name is James Grant. I'm a member of IBEW Local 11. I'm mainly just want to say I'm here for support to say we should go ahead and move forward with this proposal and get this study going forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mainly just because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I support union workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This gives us a lot of opportunities to move forward with providing good jobs, solid jobs, people that we can be proud of. I mean, when I go home every day, I worked here over on Ocean and Alamitos. I help build the current over there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I go home and see with my friends and family and I can look at something now proudly built in my city, man, I feel good and I feel like we should get more support like that. This is an opportunity for us to do what we love.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We like doing what we do, but we need those opportunities and this here agenda here with this. This change in the grid provides an opportunity for future bills. And I like to see a lot more apprentices coming in from the city so they can also go home and talk to your family and talk to their friends about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'something that they proudly build. This is one of those things that you look back on from years from now and be like, Man, I helped build that. And this is one of those opportunities that can provide that for the youth and also for the current workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It sounds like this can really help lower bills for our community as well. Give us options, give people a little bit of that alleviates part of those bills. Mainly electricity is something that we need. But, you know, it's getting is getting high.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's getting expensive unless bureau is getting hot because, you know, global warming, global warming is real. I've been a member of IBEW since 2015. I want to give that opportunity to other folks and I think you should definitely vote for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a good evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jane Tamplin 623 Rose Avenue District two Proud member IBEW. I'm here to speak about you support. For this, a feasibility study. I think we need to look at renewables. I think we need to look at newer types of energy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And here we are with a green port getting greener. I'd like to see our city following suit. I have concerns. I support the master plan. We're a growing city. I'm looking back a year ago when.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Edison was blowing men.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Man covers off the Volt, and I have a concern about our power supply. I would like to ask you to make sure included in this feasibility study is the battery power, our stored energy consideration that comes for our first responders and for some pardon my voice and for some of our private industries like hospitals where they have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'fallback. When they lose power, they go to generators which are not always reliable, unfortunately, but stored energy is in all times, and it is something that is directly fed from photovoltaic straight DC very savings involved. Excuse me. So for all the good reasons are more you're going to hear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do ask for your support on this and I thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Counsel. My name is Robert Diaz. I'm a journeyman. Inside assignment for the IBEW Local 11. Two years ago, I purchased a home in Long Beach, where I reside with my wife Molly and my son Bronson. My son is a third grader.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He goes to Bernie Elementary. CCAR would lower utility costs, which would help families like mine with the rising cost of living. Most importantly, it will create local jobs employing local workers. I would love the opportunity to build in my community, build in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm very proud of what I do. And I. I'm very proud of what I do and and the feeling of accomplishment that I would receive building in my own community. Working closer to home would reduce travel time, lower emissions, and it would allow more time for working families to spend together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, council members. My name's Jennifer No. Not only am I a proud member of IBEW Local 11, but I am also a mother of two children that go to couple's junior high school. I hope we can get your support on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not only will it create jobs in our community, it will create a sense of community pride, and it will give our children clean air, which is very important not only to them, but everybody else on the planet. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Hello, council members. My name is Manny Solis. I'm a longtime IBEW member. I have 32 years in local 11 IBEW Los Angeles, and I have resided in Long Beach on Bourbon Street here in a and Stacy Mungo's district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was accepted into the IBEW in 1987. And at that point in my early career as an apprentice, I was very fortunate to have worked on a few projects here in Long Beach and Terminal Island as well. But one I wanted to mention was the Surf Project, the Southeast Resource Recovery Facility, where they burn trash and and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'created power through a steam turbine when they heated up the the water and the piping. But that was one of the projects that I worked on. I'm very proud when I go by that project, even today, 32 years later.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And also, I worked on projects like at the port where we did ship to shore power. We provided power for the container ships that come in, and then they were able to turn off their diesel engines, which limits the pollution.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we've done that for the city of Long Beach as well. And being in this trade has provided me many, many years of great service and giving back to the community through the IBEW and also that. I'm thankful that our city leaders, leaders such as yourself had a vision back then.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I would hope that you'd continue to have that same vision for renewables and for clean power. As I have progressed in my career now. Not only electrician, also high voltage cable slicer and an instrumentation technician. That was free education through the union.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we are providing free jobs and outstanding careers for many, many youths that are coming up. And with that, I just wanted to say that approving this CCI feasibility feasibility study would move this clean, clean energy forward. And also, I would like to ask you to approve.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're also likely to approve the implementation of the C c k in a dual path so that both of these. Both move forward and create clean air and clean power for all the residents, not only in Long Beach, in Los Angeles and on the West Coast.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, council members. I'm Patricia Chen with Long Beach 350. Um, we support the staff recommendation and are pleased that the city is taking the first important step to implementing community choice aggregation. Um, it's probably one of the most important things that can be done within the city towards implementing the upcoming Climate Action Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, and it's particularly timely now that we have a U.N. report that tells us that we're in even worse trouble with the climate than we had previously thought. We do ask that you guide the development of CA in Long Beach in a direction that will result in the fastest possible transition to renewable energy and keep rates low'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for residents. Build a just transition with good green local union jobs. Um, for instance for gas and oil workers to move into as they move out of gas and oil extraction in Long Beach. And we'd like to see solar and electric incentives that are attractive and meaningful to residents of all walks of life.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And while we're here, I just want to make sure everybody lined up that wants to speak. And if not, please. Okay, I see you and I see a different guy. This lady in the front will be the last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perfect. Council members. My name is David Brzezinski of Unite and Energy Consulting, Efficiency Hero Consulting and member of the Long Beach Sustainable Business Network. With the conclusions of the recent U.N. report in mind, Long Beach has a societal and economic responsibility to investigate the feasibility of crime and to take steps between becoming a more sustainable city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That being said, we need to do it correctly. We must be intentional on the implementation and making this particular measure and this particular study. Extremely important for us to be able to become that city that we want to become.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will not work if we do not take due diligence in taking a study and learning how to become the most effective care possible. Thank you for your time, and I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi there. I'm Gabrielle Weekes, resident of the second District. But I'm the chair of the Sierra Club for the region. So I represent somebody in every one of your districts. And we've heard from people from all the districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, I'm here mostly as an environmentalist. If we had community choice aggregate, we would have less air pollution. And boy, we're at capacity with that. I've been following Community Choice for over a decade. They were doing it in the Midwest and Massachusetts, smaller states than us worked the bugs out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, you know, we've got quite a few of them going in California. The Marin County, one is so very, very popular. It's now selling energy to a lot of its neighbors. Lancaster came here and did a speech to the Sustainable City Commission over a year ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lancaster's is doing really well. They've signed on a bunch of other cities and now the county. Sheila Kuehl started one for Los Angeles County, and it's got a lot of cities in it. I can't remember how many, but a lot of the big cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So everyone's doing it and it seems to be working well. No one's had any problems yet. Large cities like Culver City and Santa monica are in the county. One I hope we move forward. It's not just good for the environment and good for the workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of workers have talked about getting good paying jobs here. These are jobs that can't be outsourced to China or someplace. But the another thing that we haven't talked about is that when we provide job opportunities for our neighbors, it is a lot less money we have to spend on city services, parks, programs, babysitting the babysitting'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that happens in libraries a lot. If people are making a decent wage, they don't have to rely on you guys to provide all kinds of other services for them. So that's it's really a win win win economically for the environment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's really going to help all of us. I'm pretty sure if you have any doubts, just look at Marin County, look at Culver City. They're loving it. And if you want to talk to me about it, I know I emailed you guys last September about it with our one page flier with some information.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of that's changed a little bit. But if you want to have a conversation with me, feel free to get a hold of me, because in the last year, I've only learned to love it more. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Okay. Hello. My name is Dean Thorgy. I'm a Long Beach resident. Seventh District. I support signing the contract. I think it's going to confirm that the code be feasible. It's worked everywhere else. There's no reason why I shouldn't work here.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'A k if it's well managed, you have some money to work with. Mainly because we don't pay dividends to stockholders. That money is to use here for things and we could do a lot of good things with our money.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We have to choose from some options. So here's my wish wishlist. Number one is to move as rapidly as possible to 100% renewable energy. The state has targeted 2045 when all the electricity in California has to be carbon free.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That's pretty good, but we need to go a lot faster. As a couple of other speakers said, climate change is the big problem, right? It's getting worse and it's getting worse faster than was expected. The science, the climate scientists have told us that the world needs to get its greenhouse gas emissions down to net zero before 2050'",
        "'speaker_14': '. That's everything. Everything. Not just electricity, but everything else. And electricity is actually the easiest part. So we should move really fast on that. The second thing is that I think we should put a large piece as possible that makes sense into local generation to build things in the locality, to provide local businesses with contracts, and especially to'",
        "'speaker_14': 'target local employment, especially for people who really need those jobs. The third one is that connected with this is that we should have programs that help reduce air pollution in the neighborhoods with the worst air pollution. So that doesn't directly come from the electricity generation, but it comes from other things, like we can use it to use'",
        "'speaker_14': 'this as a support for more electric vehicles to get vehicles that use gasoline and diesel and natural gas off the road with EVs. Then you can use the EVs and the charging system as the battery system for storage.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we generate a lot in the afternoon. We charge the batteries and draw them at night so there's no waste. So it can be part of the electrical system of the car. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. Council members Angelina Galette of I'm founder of the Renewables 100 Policy Institute. I chaired the World Council on Renewable Energy, and I'm also a member of the Long Beach Working Group for Community Choice. I'm here in support of this item, of course, and believe that this is the first step that allows Long Beach'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to empower the option of choice and enable the city to have a more local control and visibility into its energy future. The future that we all see in the energy business is highly digitized, decarbonized, decentralized and democratized. This initiative literally allows power to the people because renewables are very flexible, very modular, and they enable us to be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'building the community by community, sector by sector, focusing on the local needs with local control and what we need for our communities to achieve the goals of decarbonizing the future. CCI is another high risk at this time. They've existed for almost eight years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have credit ratings. They have been able to be funded. They have access to funding. And they operate well and efficiently. They have a track record of providing reliable service, improving resiliency, investing in jobs and economic development, and ensuring community inclusion and control.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A feasibility study and more importantly, an expedited implementation plan would allow Long Beach to have the option of exploring a CCI and indeed moving forward with the CCI. Being able to keep the deadlines that are imposed by regulations and statutes is important so that you have the option to transition as fast as possible to be able to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'take advantage of this opportunities. You can certainly work with local utilities, with the local city departments and with all stakeholders to shape the energy future of this great city. The 18 cases that have existed today have saved more than 100 million to their customers, and they have done it reliably and also with a remarkably low attrition rate'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of less than 3%. So people are incredibly happy with their case and they like to stay there because they have the option. Working with the utility hand-in-hand means it's a win win for everybody, including the utility, including the CCI, including the city and all stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Bottom line, while being low risk can provide benefits such as improving the environment, creating local jobs, investing in new technology, new development, improving resiliency and reliability of the system, creating economic development, and, most importantly, under local control. We heard about the Europe plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We heard about the fears of the community, as would enable Long Beach to epitomize the saying Act locally, think globally while you create the best K that I'm sure even Council Member Rex Richardson could be proud of for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Sustainable City Commission. I'm speaking in support of the item and I want to say that I was thrilled to see that the city staff.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Was presenting a recommendation to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Move forward with a comprehensive study.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With this item. I was a little crestfallen that it's a.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'One year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Item with three years optional to extend. I just want to say that Long Beach sometimes takes a while to develop good policies. It took us.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Ten years of discussing before we finally banned Styrofoam. It took many years to discuss urban agriculture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before we adopted a good policy. I think those policies certainly benefited from a lot of discussion. But Councilmember Pierce pointed out that there is an opportunity cost and so just urge you to move forward as quickly as possible on what is really a good policy that's going to benefit the city in so many important ways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was two years ago that the county launched their CA. Since that time, over 70 cities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Have joined them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Including almost the entire county of Ventura. And the cities that have moved forward with CCS have seen reduced rates for their citizens and businesses with increased renewable.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Energy portfolios, more local generation, more local jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's so many benefits to it. So I just urge a yes vote and to encourage city.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Staff to move forward as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Quickly as possible. Thank you so much. Good evening. My name is Dave Shukla. My address is on file and I am one of the founders and the operations director of the Long Beach Alliance for Clean Energy. I'm here this evening to urge for your strong support for a feasibility study for a Long Beach Community Choice Aggregation program'",
        "'speaker_4': '. These programs provide too many tangible benefits to communities and municipalities in California for our city, for Long Beach, to ignore the first and as we've heard many times, is the transition to a 100% carbon free, clean energy system meeting net zero goals, something that the investor owned utilities have steadfastly not achieved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it is something that now that we have not only AB 32 and SB 100 on the books, Long Beach must have the ability to determine the viability of whether these programs are feasible and perhaps even beneficial. Second tangible benefit is expanding the development of local integration of distributed energy resources.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dealers are some of the most promising and innovative pieces of the transition to clean energy from demand reduction incentivized in place to new generation to battery storage throughout the city, to microgrids. These assets can not only be owned by their local CA programs, but they can provide more than just mitigate of measures to energy demand load and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the resultant pollution, but also allow us to adapt to lock down climactic changes and provide greater reliability of grid service. And this should be really great news to all of us in Long Beach. Seeing as how we all have seen blackouts and common increasingly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The third benefit is economic development. These programs such as Marine Clean Energy, SBA, Clean Energy, have already broken ground on a number of projects in their localities that have strong economic fundamentals. From job training and apprenticeship programs to local hire to quality working conditions and high standards and output of work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we heard about so eloquently from the gentlemen who worked on The Current. We can build jobs. Careers. Workforce development that you can't offshore. That we can build out from our existing high schools and community colleges. Job programs that like the the nursing program at City College.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can be really proud of for for the tangible benefits that they provide. The next benefit, obviously, is something I don't have time for. So please, I urge you to vote for this feasibility study and do so with all posthaste.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. Thank you for allowing me to address the Council on for our city as you all represent a wide array of constituents. My name is Tiffany Davey. My address is also on file and I'm the average director of the Long Beach Alliance for Clean Energy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would like to express our support for the site of. Let's start with the first reason as this would provide the option for Long Beach to move towards 100% renewable energy, which would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Allow Long Beach as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well as we've seen with other cities, to achieve their sustainability goals much faster. In light of the IPCC report, which has been mentioned many times before this evening on the global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius, Long Beach does have the opportunity to create the pathways that will mitigate our solutions in the required 12 years of action.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This item. This item also supports the United Nations SDG number seven, which stands for the Sustainable Development Goals. Item 7.1 ensures universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services. 7.2 by 2030. Increase sustainability and the share of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Renewable, renewable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Energy in the global energy mix. And 7.3, which by 2030 would double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. I want to thank you and again, ask you to support this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. Council Staff Thank you for the opportunity to speak and thank you for your service. My name is Joe Sullivan. I work for IBEW Local 11 as well as the National Electrical Contractors Association. This represents about 350 electrical contractors in L.A. County that employ approximately 10,000 electricians.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We are in support of moving forward with this feasibility study. We think when CCS are done right, they can create jobs more quickly than utilities do. And when they have the right structure and the right workforce standards and the right partners involved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Other CCS have achieved record clean energy levels. We're seeing other benefits, like creating jobs. Lancaster As you know, there are several businesses we're seeing with other CCS solar projects on brownfield sites in low economic areas. We're seeing EV programs of EV by gallons and free EV charging systems to improve air quality in areas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we've seen cities that have goals of 100% renewable energy. And these are 20, 30 years goals. And they achieve them right away once the key is in place. They facilitate these goals and they can facilitate the port's cleaner action plan as long as as well as the city's goals.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what's important with these cases, they can help the community economically. When you create jobs, you force us to go out and hire apprentices and our apprenticeships. Amazing. It's a five year program with a remarkable education. It costs nothing for the students.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It includes not even books, tools. After the fourth year, they have full family, medical, dental. They retire with dignity and a great retirement. And they earn family sustaining wages. And all this is taught at a net zero facility with a state of the art microgrid.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So these cars are proven. We believe they can create good benefits. But not only do we want you to go forward with the implementation plan or the feasibility study, but we also encourage you to concurrently move forward with an implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You cannot get in the queue with the resource adequacy delay without an implementation plan. The CPC has passed a law that requires you to wait one year to start a CCAR in the clock doesn't start until the beginning of the year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if you wait till after this year, the clock takes two years to launch your CCR. So the implementation plan needs to start concurrently. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening for the council. In name is Sona Coffee. I'm a resident of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The fourth district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm vice chair of the city's Sustainable City Commission. I'm also here to speak in support of this item and to thank you and the staff for bringing this item to the city. You've heard the infinite amount of opportunity and benefits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That a community choice aggregation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Program can bring to Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And there really are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a lot for the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City to take in. And it's important that this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Study is structured properly so that we.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can really.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Incorporate all the benefits that we're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some things that were mentioned today, really looking at.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The different structures of the amount.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of renewable energy we want to bring to Long Beach. So looking at the scenarios where 50%.'",
        "'speaker_6': '100% renewable energy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And making.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure that those are part of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The study and that we get to assess the scenarios and the rates for that. Probably one of the most exciting things about CCAR is that you, as we as the city, will get to set our rates for electricity and pass those benefits on to the businesses and the residents in this community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And doing that in a way where.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're focusing on green energy. So we're trying to move towards 100% renewable to meet the state's goals, meet the city's goals that are reflected by what the community wants here and by the Community Action Plan that we'll.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be working on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One request I would have to make of City Council and we've heard this I think a couple of times is the timing. The data that the city has now would be enough to start the risk assessment piece of the study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That should take a couple of months if it would be possible for the staff and consultants to come back in the first quarter and three months to bring that to you. That won't be enough to do the implementation planning that Joe just mentioned from IBEW 11.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The implementation planning requires that interval data that Councilmember Pierce was asking about. So if there's any way to fast track that request through Edison and get the data back as soon as possible so the city could meet the year end deadline, that would be key in terms of getting that implementation plan in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If not, if that takes some time to get from Edison, at least putting in a structure for a timeline every three months, every quarter, something like that. So the council hears back on the progress of the study and that the community hears back from it as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would be great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. We appreciate all the public comment. I'll take it back behind a real council member, Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I want to thank everybody that made public comments, everybody that's been a part of the process of the work group. I know that everyone that spoke today has been involved in this not just for this week, for this year, but for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I really want to thank you for educating me, my staff, and working with city staff along this process. And so I want to be clear, I hear the concern loud and clear to clarify with staff that we are concurrently doing the implementation plan along with the study, and that the implementation plan based on trying to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'get the data and some of our legal questions addressed, that that is a 4 to 6 month process. Is that clear? I mean, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I'd actually like to clarify that. So we would absolutely be trying to get that data from Edison. So we we are the single largest customer. We believe that we will be asking for that implementation data, the 15 minute data.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'However, we have done some research into this about whether or not we can file an implementation plan prior to the end of the year. In order to do that, you would have to pass an ordinance saying We are doing SCCA.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So you would have to positively pass morning saying We're in, we're going to do it before you complete a feasibility study. That's not something that staff is comfortable recommending. We believe you need to be doing that feasibility study.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'That's why we're here tonight and then we will continue to try to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Get that data. We are hopeful we'll be able.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'To access it or we'll do as much of the feasibility study as we can. And our process is right now about a 4 to 6 month process. If we can go faster, will go faster. But we do believe you need to have a feasibility study before you make a decision on whether to take that next step and'",
        "'speaker_13': 'do the implementation plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could we request? I would like to request that this item comes back in four months with a review, even if all the data is not there, but that in four months we actually have a staff report on where the implementation in the study is.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Sure, we can certainly do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I know that. I think one of the challenges with this item has been that we've had a lot of dates, we've had a lot of information. There are a lot of aides out there, 18, that already exist.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've seen Lancaster that's done a great job with their work. And just trying to get us to have these conversations holistically with everybody at the table has been the goal. And so can you briefly talk about the process that the study is going to to implement for how they're not only gathering the data, but some of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'things that they're going to be doing to include all the stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly Pearce, like any study, it starts with gathering the data and then the next step would be doing the analysis. In this case, you have to look at a load analysis and that would look at Long Beach is very unique.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These other cities that that have been mentioned are nowhere near as complex as Long Beach. I think there's approximately 140,000 Edison accounts in the city of approximately 150 of those control, over 50% of the load. So their participation and their opt out status would be critical to this study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And those things have to be looked at in very much in detail. There's been some recent regulatory changes that have impacted the PCR charge. Those also impact the feasibility study and next year there's going to be another direct access offering by the PUC whereby large industrial and commercial customers can elect to participate in those procure their own'",
        "'speaker_4': 'power, basically circumventing a PC or a city's choice. So we need to look at those very much in detail. So that would be part of the analysis. Once you've completed that portion, you would have a better understanding of your load.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then you have to look at forecasting the rates to compare. Would a pricing schedule be advantageous to what Edison's offering? There's a number of things that are changing in that arena as well. So all those need to be conducted first.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once you complete the analysis, you would draw some conclusions from that and make some recommendations. And we're hopeful to have that completed. We could do something hopefully very quickly in four months, but if it got more complex, it would certainly take a little additional time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. So just no matter where we're out of in four months, we could get a report back at council. Not a two from four, but at council. That would be amazing. Keep us on track. I want to also highlight knowing that Long Beach is complex, knowing that it's different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know that it's been brought up several times that here we have city and other cities don't have. SC You know, Lancaster has a different structure than us, but they've really worked with seemed to be clear with everyone is that this doesn't take SC out, but they deliver the energy that we opt on what percentage we want'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to be renewable? 100% renewable would be amazing of course, but that SC still has a role to play in this equation. And so I just wanted to to say that I urge my council colleagues to vote to move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that this is the way that we can democratize power. This is the way we can ensure that we have job creation, not just for Long Beach residents, but we can have a conversation down the road about how do we prioritize who gets those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, is it single families? Is that people that have been previously incarcerated? This is really an opportunity to lift all boats, to clean the energy, to clean our air, and to transform the city of Long Beach into practice of what so many of us have felt here for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I think it's the right thing to do, and we can continue to have community conversations about this in the next several months. But I'm really happy that we're finally at a place where we're agenda raising this and bringing all these consultants on board so that we can do it the right way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Councilman Alston. So I think this ESEA conversation, I've followed it for a long time and though a lot of people have, I think it's a really interesting conversation and I won't elaborate too much, but I see some real potential opportunities here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'More specifically to the benefit programs for our local residents as well as create local jobs. Now I want to say that I don't want us as long, long beach as the second largest city, not just in L.A. County, but in six Southern California counties.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't want us to be absent from the regional conversation in our case. And I know that the county, Los Angeles, has been for a while talking about a countywide SICA or establishing some guidelines or some rules. I knew that there was a deadline before about a opt in and when they didn't get certain participation, I know'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that conversation had changed. And so I think being the large the large city that we are and our relationships with the county, we should communicate to the county that we are engaging in this discussion and see if whatever accommodations can be made for us to participate in the regional conversation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because what happens is those cities who have opt in, opt in, they're going to be able to help create the write the rules for whatever happens at the you know, whatever happens at the county wide level. They're going to be able to help write those rules.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And although we're not at the place where we have an ordinance passed tonight, I think they will want to know whether or not Long Beach is interested in engaging in this conversation. So I don't think it would be too too much to ask, you know, ask, you know, Tom or whoever to to reach out to Gary zero'",
        "'speaker_11': ', the county or whoever is engaging and say, hey, look, we've taken this first step to engage in this study. Our council is very interested in this, but we haven't until we figure out these things, we don't know if we're going to be in or not, but we like to participate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that might help inform our decision of whether or not we participate. So so first, Tom or Mr. West, is there is there any headaches with reaching out to the county and requesting that we be a part of those regional conversations?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So we have been part of the regional conversations. We sent staff to just about all of the regional county meetings. So we're very much plugged in to what's going on at the county. And part of this study is my understanding is we would be looking not just do we do our own care, but could we participate in'",
        "'speaker_13': 'somebody else's. So yeah, we you know, we can certainly reiterate the discussion that we had tonight, but also we'd be looking at their model to see what what they do that might work for us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. And again, you know, I think this is very interesting, some real opportunities. You know, everything else we've done, we've aired on the side of local control. We've aired on the side of the American Army. Conclusion. We've, you know, we know that there are gaps in terms of like, you know, there's a lot of programs for low'",
        "'speaker_11': 'income solar individuals. And solar is very expensive. But what about those middle class working families who are getting 300, $400 light bills and they want to participate, too? And we can figure out, you know, we can figure out programs by utilizing this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think the opportunities are there. And I'm glad to hear that you're at the table for those regional conversations. I know that they want Long Beach to be a part of this conversation, but we should do our diligence.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So those are my remarks. Again, I thought, I think this was healthy. And again, whatever we can do to make sure we don't miss any opportunities with the county, I think that's helpful. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thanks so much for everybody staying real late. We appreciate that very much. I know this has been a good conversation so far. And thank you, Bob, for being here and certainly doing the work behind the scenes and getting us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we appreciate this very much. I just want to reiterate, you know, there have been a lot of interest within our residents and not just people who are environmentalists by trade, but really people that just absolutely care about our city and want to diversify our energy portfolio.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And having been a councilmember that experienced in 2016 the drama we went through with Edison, and not to say that that can happen anywhere else, but I think that we have an opportunity here to really look forward and see what the options are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And really, as I mentioned, put the power to the people. I really love that because that is very important. And I know a lot of our residents really want to have that choice for many, many reasons. And I do think, you know, the governor, Governor Brown, has mandated by 2045 to get to 100% renewable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we can absolutely do that beforehand. And I know that's something that is attainable and this is moving forward in the right direction. We'll do that. A quick question. If we were to once once the feasibility comes back and if we were to create that the ordinance, are there any challenges with the implementation plan with the state'",
        "'speaker_4': '? Know you would follow the implementation plan with the CPC and it would basically put them on notice of your plan and expected load requirements and your methodology for preparing it so they could schedule that accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then is there any other, like issues with that at all? I mean, anything else that. Would keep us from doing that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And so what I would just close in saying is that, you know, the K what's nice is that in getting it, you know, move faster is that there are rules changing every day with energy and with state legislation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would say the faster we can get this done and I know we're doing as much as we can, you've heard it from various people, the better in terms of being able to make our own decisions and do what's right for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you so much for indulging us and we appreciate it and I look forward to moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. So I'll just add my comments here and say that I'm going to support this item because I've been intrigued with the case for some time now. Many municipalities, local governments throughout the state are looking and going in is moving in this direction because it does provide an options for clean and renewable energy for for our communities'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and it creates good local jobs. And from from my standpoint, those are those two points alone should be merit this council being aggressive about moving in that direction and staff for that matter. And so I'm really encouraged by the fact that we are moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're going forward with a feasibility study tonight. I know under the staff report, it says timing, considerations. And I just want to be clear on that. It says to expeditiously complete the cay feasibility study for the city. And what is expeditious me.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you just one more time if you could just tell us what that means.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the current estimate, based on the scope, is about 4 to 6 months we've been asked to come back and four months, and we can certainly do that and we'll let you know where we are from from that point.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So as Bob mentioned, it can be pretty complex. And if we need to do additional study, I will have the contract authority to do so. But our plan right now is 4 to 6 months.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I know there is a lot of urgency and excitement from the public on this and certainly by some members of the council as well. But I think tonight by approving this this item, we will make a great first step in this direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I'm supportive of doing that. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Thank you. I just had two comments. One. One in reference to County versus Long Beach. I think we're a city of half a million. And when we talk about local control, we talk about job creation. The county level doesn't have as much detail to what kind of job creation we want to the type of level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think it's great that we're having this conversation about Long Beach and what that might look like because the county's kind of already done their process and we would be opting into that. So we we have that there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's important for us to identify what a Long Beach process would look like. And to I guess, my my question on the implementation plan, if we did an implementation plan and we did an ordinance, is there anything keeping us to that say we submitted that to the CPC?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there anything saying that we couldn't three months later go through a process and say, you know what, a CCAR isn't right for us?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly you have that option. I believe it's the Palm Desert one just did the same thing where they filed their implementation plan with the APC and then recently withdrew that great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that was the clarity I was looking for, that we could do an ordinance, we could do an implementation plan. If that takes 4 to 6 months, however long that hopefully sooner rather than later, but that even that doesn't tie our hands requiring us to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just want to make sure that was stated clearly. So thank you, everybody, for your support and thank you. STAFF Let's vote.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Members, please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion carries a two.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. Looks like we finally did something right tonight. So next up is a public comment for those who signed up early. We have Larry Goodhue, Christy Moore, Melly, Fernando Gallardo, Alex Armstrong and Latoya Marshall. Please line up. You have 3 minutes each.'"

        "'speaker_7': 'Great honorable mayor and city council. Good evening. Just a quick recap. In January 2017, the mayor and city manager asked the Long Beach Innovation Team to work with the police department on the public safety priority. From that yearlong research process in January 2018, the city launched a first of its kind justice lab to provide new tools to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city staff to deliver individuals out of the criminal justice system and toward treatment care and other resources. We've developed a justice lab video that we're premiering tonight. We're encouraging the community to share this at community events, community meetings, committees, commissions, and on social media.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How can data be used to improve public safety and help residents stay out of prison? This was the question that launched a new collaboration between the city's innovation team and the Long Beach public safety continuum, which consists of police, fire, health and other organizations throughout the county.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Justice Lab is a strategy that the city of Long Beach, too, developed to focus on the top 5% of repeat offenders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we cite or arrest them and we pull their criminal histories. They've been arrested ten, 12, sometimes 17 or 18 times. So these are the same people that are being arrested and cited, are also being transported to the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're having interactions with the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're not the ones committing the violent crimes. They're not the ones that are committing the high level property thefts. They're really the folks who often in fact, half of them are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're intersecting with our various city departments. But historically, those departments hadn't connected the dots that we're all seeing that same person in our different outreach efforts, if you will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is the first time a robust and comprehensive data sharing platform has been created where all the involved partners and departments can input and access information. So the more that we can connect them to service, the less likely they are to end up back in jail and about on our streets.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Currently, the justice lab has launched three key initiatives. Each is designed to intervene at points where low level offenders interact with city services. First, the jail, where a clinician first offers help.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have had the opportunity to meet with approximately 400.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'People who are open to getting help and so really is planting that seed of hope.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'That once they're out there, we have a plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another key point of intervention is the actual courtroom where, again, individuals who committed low level crimes are offered alternatives to time in jail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Instead of seeing that case come out with jail or incarceration.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not solving the problem. So we need to look at what approach will keep that person off the street and in some kind of treatment. You're going to have better results for the individual and you're going to have safer streets where those people are not on the streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So committing crimes again.'",

In total, the clinician provided 214 direct referrals that mostly involved mental health, substance abuse and homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We wanted to share an example of what a success stories looks like. The clinician met with a young man, let's say, named John, who had previously been diagnosed with a mental health disorder. It was noncompliant with medication. John was receptive to services and authorized a clinician to contact his father to be part of his support system.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Just briefly, I wanted to thank the I-Team and everyone who has partnered on this video. First of all, I think the video is a really great way to showcase the efforts and the multiple departments working together. Is the video going to be available for us to share on social media?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, it will look good if we can get a copy of that. And I'd love to see it come to Public Safety Committee meeting as well. So Jacko will connect with you guys on that. I like the data driven portion of this, and I know our city prosecutor had a lot to do with making it such that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'different departments can communicate and share information. I know that's always a major area of concern, given all the different privacy issues that are concerned with when we're talking about individuals health and welfare. But I think being able to do that and share that information is really going to help us be effective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm wondering some of these programs that we tried or that we're trying that are part of this presentation are is there a plan to make any of these permanent programs for the city like the jail clinician program? That pilot has ended, correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that's correct. And due to the success of the six month pilot, PD is funding the clinician and jail program for an additional year for fiscal year 19. That's fine. Okay. So you should have started the presentation with that because that's a really, really good news.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I, I want to thank the police department for doing that because, you know, when you try a pilot and it works, figuring out how to incorporate it and making a permanent program is really important. And I think the jail clinician program is is one of their step that, you know, it's from the presentation that you'",
        "'speaker_7': 'guys said of the 800 and something folks that you interviewed of, over 50% were homeless. And many of them indicated that going to jail was not something they viewed as a deterrent, but rather they view jail as a place of respite.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I've repeated that many times. So I think being able to capture that moment and some of the vulnerabilities and sensitivities that come at that moment through the use of a jail clinician is really powerful. So thank you to the police department for making that happen and to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's just a lot of great work here. I'm I'm I wish this was a little bit earlier in the night because this program and the efforts deserve a lot of recognition and certainly something that we will share with our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, as I'm sitting here, I'm getting emails from residents about this encampment here, this homeless individual here, and what are you why aren't you doing anything about this there? And so if we can convey kind of some of the work that you're doing on behalf of the city, in this regard, in a in a way like'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a video like this, I think that will go a long way, not for everyone. It won't appeal to everyone, but it will appeal to some. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, I want to echo those comments. I think that this is definitely great work. I know you guys have been doing a lot of work over the last several years and it's great to see it finally come to fruition and this holistic view and implementation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, you know, this weekend I was fortunate enough to be at the women's shelter event in Councilmember Price's district. And, you know, we got to hear everybody speak. And I think one person that spoken, Dave Halbert, got mentioned it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then your comments about the changing times and how we engage with those that come through the system and whenever we're dealing with so many different crimes and some of them, you know, crimes where mental health is a big player in that, it's really important that Long Beach really is leading that way.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think we don't celebrate the work that you guys are doing enough as council officers are. I don't. And so I do want to ask for the the video to be shared with us and any information that you can share directly with my council office so that we can include that in our emails that go out'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And also want to thank Petey for funding that for another year.

But just congratulations team for really taking technology, taking the the equity lens that you guys have been talking about and partnering'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with with all the key players in this. So really proud of you guys. Proud of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Tracy Alma, the entire team. This was fantastic. This was an amazing presentation. I think, you know, considering all the work that's happened over the years in terms of violence prevention. I felt like a lot of that conversation had had sort of diminished.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this was evidence that, no, this pivot to, you know, data driven justice and, you know, integrating sort of this this focus on data. I think it was smart to take it, take some time, refocus, rebrand. And I think this is if anything, this is a lot cooler.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's going to it may build broader support because the concept of violence prevention in general is still a difficult concept, concept to explain to the public. This has a lens on on on the actual whole person. It's data driven.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It makes a lot of sense. And so I support this and I think this presentation has sparked a lot of questions for me. And one in particular, what are the what are the opportunities by what what will this data what is the potential for this data to tell us about our city?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Or what tactics what tactics are most successful in terms of saving saves and saving resources into the system, not only the system, but our our direct budget? Is this going to show us or give us some opportunities to see which tactics actually save money and save lives?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If so, how soon will we start to see evidence from some of those tactics?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as Alma mentioned, we we are doing a rigorous evaluation in collaboration with our research partners from UCLA and Cal State, Long Beach, and identifying what are the outcomes beyond just the immediate individuals and looking at the cost effectiveness, looking at the amount of time law enforcement spends with a given individual or fire department spends on a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'given individual is part of that evaluation. So the evaluation period right now is. It's between 18 months to 24 months. So at around that time, we should start. Well, at that time we will have conclusive numbers, but as we proceed forward with the evaluation periodically, we will start generating those numbers as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So between 18 to 24 months from the beginning of the pilot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From the beginning of the program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Getting into the programs and going for how long?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think we started out. How long do you want?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, thank you. Council member. The justice plan was officially launched in January 2018, but clinician and jail pilot was from April, April through September 2018. So that's a six month period. And with our other initiatives like the MDT, we're refining and deploying a feasibility study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So through that process, we probably will start looking at outcomes. Six months from now on that what we were able to gain from the feasibility study of the MDT, the multidisciplinary team.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And councilmember, if I can add, one of the neat things about this is this was funded by team resources, this effort which then led to an implementation plan. We got grant money to actually build the implementation and then we got grant money to monitor about what implementations we do are actually the most effective.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So all of this brought additional money and we can do exactly what you're talking about, which is seeing which are the most effective ways to intervene.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. And so I'll close with this. I think this is a step in the right direction. It has my complete full support. I want to make sure we stay on top of the evaluation. And I want to I want to begin now, if we haven't already thinking about how we continue to support this funding through that two'",
        "'speaker_11': 'year period, we should continue this pilot. And even if it requires us being creative about our general fund, we should support this pilot all the way through with with the idea that we're going to make a case for to structurally fund this because it long term saves not just the system, but it saves our budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so and so I'm going to be I love that you made this presentation to the station tonight, and I'm going to make sure that we I'm going to be engaging on this issue to make sure you have the resources you need.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Jurado.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you, Councilmember Orson, for recognizing me. I totally support this item. I think this is one of those programs and pilot programs that we have to look at with the idea of full implementation and full resources to continue this program all the way through.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think we need to find a way other than grants and temporary funding to continue this. I think that already it's having some positive effects and we need to continue that and with a sustainable budget that will that will keep it going into the future.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I could support this and with the expectation that we can get more data in terms of outcomes as where how we can really acknowledge our successes with this program so that we can for further sustain it as part of our implementation plan for addressing our crime.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thought you were next. That's okay. I just want to say thanks again so much. And, you know, I think this is wonderful and it's a really good example. I hear it working for Microsoft. I hear it up in the Silicon Valley about the justice lab in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that that's a really I'm excited. People don't even know who I am on the city world. They know who I am with Microsoft. And when I hear great things happening about our city, that really makes me very proud.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm glad that we were able to to do this and get this running. And we have really great numbers, too, to prove that this could be a long lasting, sustainable program. Just one thing I'll just and I'm sure you already know, but the Obama Foundation has tons of money they do for these specific projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We actually have an Obama fellow in L.A. who's working on similar projects, and he's looking to work specifically in Long Beach. So I'll make sure to put you in contact. But I think that that would be a great one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I just think overall, congratulations. Thanks so much for all your work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilmember. And I'll add that, you know, I believe that this this what this report was great and that it was clearly paying dividends and producing deliverables early. This is shows that, you know, we can be smart with data and smarter with how we use our resources.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Get those who are just getting out of jail or prison into the education, either GEDs, community college, wherever they need to go into.

        "'speaker_4': 'There is no Pinto Club no more. Okay. Very Long Beach when the funding left. All the programing that we're at, any university or any any educational system. Those were the first programs that were cut, was the education for those that were coming home from incarceration or for those that were currently incarcerated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, what we do. My name is John Lewis Hernandez, and I'm the president for Rising Scholars. And so what we have done is firmly believed in how education can change lives. Similarly to her, I started very young with my and my criminal record.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And it wasn't until I was in school and I made a decision kind of looking at the continuum that you guys were doing it and the referrals and that and the substance abuse and the mental health. But then I started thinking for myself when I wanted to be a drug and alcohol counselor, I was like, Well, what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are they going to do once they have their life together? And I thought about education, and education had set me straight. Currently, I'm earning my master's degree in counseling with an emphasis in student development, higher education, looking to work at community colleges, starting a program like Minto programs, which is right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have 114 community colleges in the state of California, and only about two thirds of them have something for formerly incarcerated students. All the schools have, have or are beginning the process for a project rebound, which is what the new iteration of the Pinto Club is, and not all the community colleges around them will support it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're uniquely in in a city like Long Beach that has a community college and a CSU located within the same city where you can have a warm hand-off.

Representatives from the city would come. The applicant could also come with her representatives and the case would be presented where ABC would make the ultimate decision on that.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'But what I'd like to understand or move to and maybe this is a broader conversation, but I'd like to understand when we go through a process of vetting contracts, there should be some some eligibility or some standard in place that talks about compliance with with sort of, you know, labor standards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we should have an understanding on what that is before we are presented with an opportunity to extend, you know, a contract by $7 million. I'd like to I'd like to personally know that I don't know if this is the venue to have that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm going to vote and support this. But I think we definitely need to figure out a better way. I don't want to I think it's unfair to the projects. It's unfair to public works. If every you know, if when these contracts come up and these issues are are not necessarily vetted and we're not in a strong'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So those are my remarks. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I will take this opportunity to chime in as well. I just had a question regarding our own city compliance officers. And has there been any issues with this particular contract here in Long Beach? That you are aware of?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, I'm not aware of any issues associated with Long Beach work and prevailing wage or any judgments against this contractor. And as we move forward with the permanent RFP, I will ensure that we collect that information and provide that to this council when we bring the item forward for an on call concrete contractor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm gonna also just go to the time sensitivity of this particular item. You know, are there projects lined up? Can you just tell me what they are?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So currently we don't have anybody under contract that can provide concrete work other than all-American and all-American is our street contractor. So, as you know, this council has supported a complete Street's approach. So when we do any street work, we are also doing sidewalk repair.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So all-American. When they do a street, they will pick up concrete. But any ADA ramps, any path of travel issues. As you know, as part of the A419 budgeted option, there is $2 million allocated towards sidewalk work. There's $500,000 towards our ADA Rapid Response Program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do not currently have a contractor on board that can provide that work. So C.J. would be use to install many of our ADA ramps, etc. until we can get a permanent bidder in place. And as I mentioned earlier, that RFP is on the street currently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I anticipate having all those bids closed and have a recommendation before council in March or April of 19.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So my question is, I mean, we just heard some information and public comment that, you know, I think gave the council some pause and concern. I've asked questions regarding our own city compliance and dealings with this particular contractor, and you're not aware of any any issues.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I would feel a lot better if if we could have an opportunity and maybe a couple of weeks to look into this. We're continuing this item for two or three weeks will hurt the productivity of the projects.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'to bring forward to council, and I'm anticipating that will be in March or April.'",
