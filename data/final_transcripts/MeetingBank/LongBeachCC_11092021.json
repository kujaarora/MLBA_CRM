        "'speaker_0': 'And you're still on the second floor?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, we came down. We jumped over the railing and landed on the bridge. And there's a bridge that was built just for the convention center. It's called the Rainbow Bridge. Lining the bridge is an English garden that is spec tacular, and then in the center of the bridge is guess what a wine bar is?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am going to turn this over to Charlie, who is our general manager. It's amazing space here. My stage is decorated behind me, red, white and blue. As a matter of fact, the whole terrace was red, white and blue.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Tour. Thank you. Bye bye.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am happy to say that we booked this event and we booked four others using a similar format. So it's the video that gets them here. But when they're here, what sells them is the turnkey spaces that save them hundreds of thousands of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We created these turnkey spaces where we reposition the convention center. Now, I'm going to ask Steve to come up and talk to us a little bit more about the repositioning, as well as our competitive market.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks again. Good evening. As Kenya mentioned, one of the key things for us has been the repositioning of the convention center and also utilizing the new technologies in virtual streaming. With that, we've noticed, especially over the last several years, we are competing more and more with large big box hotels or another chain called Gaylord, which Marriott Corporation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bought a few years ago. These are all inclusive. You basically could put downtown Long Beach under this roof, has the same number of hotel rooms, the same amount of convention space, the amount of exhibit space. So we knew as a facility that we had to migrate into a four star hotel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For many of you, this was our bathrooms in the promenade before our renovation ten years ago. This is what our bathrooms now look like. Again, more of a four star hotel since we're competing with four star hotels more frequently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was our lobby. This is now our lobby. This was our Terrace Theater. This is now our Terrace Theater. As you can tell, all these spaces have been extremely activated with lighting, chandeliers, paintings, couches, places for people to connect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our Terrace Theater, just. It looked this way. Now it's this way. We are definitely competing with Gaylord Hotels and big box hotels. This is the bridge, which of course connects both sides of our campus. And what we basically did is we we residential ized the facility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was a comment made to me by Susie in Africa years ago. She said, Steve, I used to come in here and I'd want to run out. Now I want to stay. We've achieved through the TEDx model looking at spaces and creating turnkey, turnkey events such as the Pacific Ballroom, the Pacific Ballroom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We needed 40,000 square feet for $10 million. We repositioned us, took us from 23% utilization to 83% utilization. And in that same time period, more of our nonprofits in the city were able to use us to raise money for their various groups.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as a city, we got to benefit from this. But as an aside, Sacramento just spent $40 million to build a 40,000 square foot ballroom. And we, through adaptive reuse, did ours in ten. The Cove was another space by the TED conference and now especially with COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Having an outdoor space is very critical for special events. And lastly, our Terrace Theater and that performing art area. What does this really mean at the bottom line? Besides, a lot of smiles from customers. If you look at 2013, you go up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at that straight line. It's almost like a virgin spaceship. We've gone up 40% in total. The convention center, their revenue in catering has doubled in five years. That's not common. In addition, you can't just have the assets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You have to have the service. Our hotel partners are convention center partners. All of you behind the dais in our city staff. Our customers know it's this, as they call it, unique partnership, which makes us win. So with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think in Long Beach, I have found something brand new and really something that for the first time in a very long time has excited me. I have been in the association business for more than 30 years. I've seen a lot of convention centers and Long Beach has thought through every single piece of what the meeting experience'",
        "'speaker_4': 'should be. And they have created a space that I don't think is duplicated anywhere in the country. We went through a bid process. We're looking at what is a post-COVID meeting look like. We ended up having three finalists.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Long Beach just blew us out of the water. Long Beach has done so much of the work for you. They have invested in just incredible set pieces and decor and lighting grids and things that most associations can afford at most convention centers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We actually pay a decorator to bring in sofas and chairs to create lounge space. We pay decorators to put sets on stage. Don't have to do that at Long Beach. All of that is part of the package and can save millions dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think Long Beach is truly a pioneer in the industry. I think that it is really innovating in ways that are going to set the tone for the entire convention world. I am absolutely now a convert. I mean, I think Long Beach needs to have evangelists, people telling the story.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think my experience so far, I'm happy to be one of those people who go out and tell the long story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Ken, you mentioned that convention booked with us just two weeks ago. Tonight, we also have a very special guest, president of Pima sheriff. Sheriff was here in February, right before the pandemic in March. Sheriff is definitely one of those other evangelists for Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sheriff represents 8000 meeting planners that do over a million events a year. Please welcome. Welcome, sheriff. Sheriff. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Council members, council staff. It really is an honor for me to speak to you. My name is Sheriff Kermit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you can see up on the screen, my ugly picture. My organization is Pixma, the Professional Convention Management Association. We are a global organization based in Chicago, and we have over 8000 members. Our members plan more than 2 million meetings annually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our industry just prior to COVID, if it was a country by GDP, would have been the 14th largest country in the world. It was worth $1.07 trillion. Mayor and council. That was just the means to the end. It was not the end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's actually overspend. But what we do is much more important what we do. And what you're seeing in your city is that we use tourism assets, but really we spur every other industry and of other industries growth for when we bring people together, when we meet face to face, we drive all our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's what's so important about what Steve and his team does. I'm not going to repeat all the wonderful things about Long Beach that you've already heard, but I'll tell you a couple of things that I've observed. Long Beach has not been a pioneer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You've actually been a trailblazer. And thank you for your support of the CVB. You've been a trailblazer in what Long Beach has been doing from research, from the trend study. And when you think about it, we foster human connection connections just like you do in this chamber.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And every day we bring people together to solve complex problems. And so the atmosphere that Steve and his team has built at the convention center is ideal for fostering human connections. And it is why Long Beach is a leader in the business events industry world over, not just in your city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You talked about competition, and competition is not necessarily in your state. Competition is not necessarily in our country. Competition comes from everywhere in associations and corporations look everywhere to hold their business. So it is critically important that your city is as competitive as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I'm what I've experience in Long Beach, not only are you trailblazing and setting the standard of today, you're looking ahead and you're keeping your competitors at bay by constantly improving. And that's so, so very important. I also want to address just very quickly before I go on, I know my time is limited that your city'",
        "'speaker_1': ', under Steve's leadership, has also shown incredible leadership and thought leadership across the state. They brokered a relationship with Visit California, where visit comes up. All right. I'll stop there. Can I please finish the last thought? Where? Visit California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Become a partner of peace, an industry and mayor that shows Steve's leadership and your leadership as a community. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And let's give a big round of applause to the CVB for that great presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Could we just say thank you to everybody? I know you read a lot of signs. We thought you might enjoy this, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And we do have some comments from the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, so I'll I'll go ahead and go to the councilman. I'll make some comment after that to Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thank you for those signs. That was awesome. And I appreciate that. Just congratulations to the CVB and the Convention Center team for winning the stellar awards. And the reason that you win so many awards is because you have a very unique and strong relationship with the CVB and the center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't know if you guys know, but in most cities, these organizations are at odds. And so here it's so awesome that that we are working hand in hand. The CVB and the Center are great working partners, and I just really greatly appreciate your tree lighting the fireworks that we all got to enjoy on July 4th'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And it's so important and much appreciated that you are engaged in the community and you do a lot. To bring businesses into town. And I'm just so grateful for you. It's also apparent, even as a resident, I live right next door to the to the convention center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How much that has gone into repositioning the convention center with the new residential eyes, special event spaces and Long Beach is now competitive, really competitive in this new environment. And we know how engaged you are in the community and you do so much more to bring conventions and tourists into town.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's so important. And Sheree, thank you. It was good to see you again. I agree with you. And what you said earlier is that, you know, one of the things that we've done as a city when things got tough, like the Japanese are sharpening the iron, that's what we do here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are just really good at looking at what we can do to be better. And I am so appreciative of everything that this whole team has done here. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman. Councilman in the house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm so thrilled and excited to say congratulations to CVB for other awards not only this year, but you continuously seem to back them up. And it makes me so proud to be a Long Beach residents and to have you leading this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you for making Long Beach a vital hub for meetings and tourism and for creating jobs for residents. So very, very important. Also, you're also very involved with the community. Thank you so much for on the the wonderful street clean ups neighborhood cleanups that you participated in this past summer and helped us out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're out there with shovels and and everything, bags and brooms and everything to be able to clean up our streets. And that really shows community and that really shows that you care. And also, thank you so much for being a sponsor of one of the most traditional holidays, that empire, the Los Muertos that we had on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pine Street. And just knowing that we have such great partners in CVB, I think is amazing and you give so much back to the community. So I want to say thank you to you and congratulations. And one more thing, if I could see those thank you's and hearts, because that was a beautiful photo of that I can't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'miss. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson. Just a few.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thoughts. First, I know what the past year has been for the tourism industry. Not only did our local CBP step up for Long Beach, but you stepped up for the whole state of California and led the effort to get our conventions back to the state of California, which drives our local economy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It helps our general fund, our bottom line or public safety services. First. First, thank you for all your leadership that you've shown in the course of the past year. Secondly, it's important to note that not only did you just look out for the convention center, you looked out for the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I saw an incredible video highlighting North Long Beach's recovery and the things that are happening in North Long Beach. And it was incredibly impressive. I was impressed by that. I've never seen our convention center tell visitors to go to North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Never has that happen. And so I want to say on behalf of that was an incredibly proud moment, so important on behalf of me and my residents and the work that we're doing. Thank you so much, you and Samantha and everybody who had something something to do with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much for what you've done. The CVB is an incredible asset and you continue to have our support. You continue to show up for our city, and we look forward to continuing to support you. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor. I just want to thank you so much for the presentation and an update and appreciate having your staff do their part so that we can meet them. Because I know that it's been a challenging year and transitions as my colleagues have shared.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's really great to see you coming back at more than full swing. It's just full circle as not to doing what you all do best.

My name is Eric Mueller and I'm the executive director of US Vets Long Beach, the home of the largest homeless, previously homeless veterans service organization in the nation. I just wanted to thank you all for the opportunity to speak today, and thank you for all of your support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Every day I look at young men and young women who have served our country and are unfortunately plagued with mental health disorders or the inability to find affordable housing, and is with the support of both our council members here in our community, members that I'm able to serve over 800 people a day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, with all things considered, I just wanted to spend this opportunity to both thank you and thank them for their service and thank you for acknowledging all of their hard work to make our freedoms what they are today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you, Mr. Miller, and everyone that spoke, obviously. Again, thank you all for your service. Deeply appreciate. It's good to see Mr. Murray back there as well. So. Always good. Always good to see him. And I want to go ahead and also go to Councilman Mongo who signed up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to take a moment to appreciate each of you for coming forward today. And then I want to extend a hand at least once a week. My husband and I visited American Legion. He's actually I just texted him to find out where he's at, 716 tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if any of you wanted to pop by, he's happy to buy you a beer. I think it's really important for there to be opportunities for veterans and your families to come together in a very relaxed environment. And if there's anything I can ever do to be supportive of you or any particular veteran, please don't hesitate to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'reach out. This is a continued process and a very big gap between the ages that you see of individuals that have come together and the ages of individuals who are actually veterans. And so I'm appreciative of all of you and your diversity today and a lot of you and your youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I hope that you'll reach out to others in your same demographics and bring them in because that family is a very strong family. And until you can sit in a casual environment and really talk about life together and the perspective that you have, there's just so much value in that that comes with that relaxed environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if you'd like a beer, he's at 716 tonight and happy to toast to any of you. Thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gentlemen, often. Thank you. And I want to also appreciate this presentation this evening and salute our veterans and everyone throughout the city who are coming together in recognition. Veterans Day is usually a very special day here in the city of Long Beach and particularly in the north side of the city where we do, you know, we have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a parade and a fabulous recognition for for our veterans. I'm very, very heartened to know that we're going to give a special recognition to our former vice mayor, Val Lerche. He is deserving much deserving of the recognition because he has led the charge for veterans in the city for many, many years and oftentimes with what resistance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But he's done so valiantly. And it's really, really sad that to understand that he is dealing with some some serious health issues today. I'd just like to also take this opportunity, and I'll do so in home new business as well, but also to invite the public to the Expo Art Building at 4321 Atlantic Avenue on Thursday, Veterans'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Day from 12 to 712 noon to 7:30 p.m.. There'll be a special African American Military Heroes exhibit hosted by the African-American Cultural Center at Long Beach. And so a great presentation. There was a preview of it at first Friday's just the other night, but they really have gone out of their way to to to honor our veterans'",
        "'speaker_1': ', particularly those of African-American descent. So I invite you to participate in that. And thanks again for this presentation, Athena. Thank you, Councilmember Ringo. Thank you. Not only does the US vet in the Senate district, but they also had a gold star matter that honors the families of our servicemen who lost their lives and made the ultimate sacrifice'",
        "'speaker_1': '. One of the things that that has been known at me for for many, many years. Many of you know that I was a recruitment officer for the city for many years. And during that time we offered for employment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We offered reference points for individuals who were Vietnam era and before veterans. That has not changed from what I know and with all the various wars that we've had and they've been declared wars, we haven't changed that at all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you know, with all due respect to my friend Mike, very Vietnam era. He's not eligible anymore for the veteran appointee to all. They're afraid that he's retired. There's there's a difference. But, you know, I think it's it's a shame that we can't offer veterans points to those who participated in the various wars in the last few'",
        "'speaker_1': 'years, you know, Iraq, Afghanistan, for 20 years who were there. And I think that we need to look at changing that. And we have a new human resources director and perhaps we can work with him and maybe what we can do to change that, that opportunity for veterans to gain a point or two when they get on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the list for employment with the city especially, we're looking at those who are police officers and firefighters that we want to recruit and serve for the city. So perhaps very directive to the city manager in regards to maybe get something going with that if even if it's just the city lobby set offers that, I don't know if'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that would be possible, but I think it's something worth looking into in investigating. Want me to answer that, Mr. Modica? So come to me. I think Mr. Murdoch and I were literally just talking about this very same thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So back when I watched you, when I was on the city council, I put a measure on on the ballot, a city wide ballot Measure C, and it did the exact same thing. It passed by a strong majority of the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it was just getting some of the data we're going to actually put out. I think Mr. Murdoch is going to be putting out a memo about this here in the next day or two. But the the additional points that were given to the civil service program has provided since we passed the since the city passed measure'",
        "'speaker_1': ', see what it was put on the ballot. It's already provided 4480 veterans additional opportunity to seek employment, with the city making up seven to about 7.2% of the of our qualified candidates over the last ten years. And so I had not seen this data until just a few days ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that this is a they're putting together a memo that's going to go to the council and to the community. And so we often don't talk about about Measure C. It's actually one of the first things that I brought to the council when I got elected and we put it on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it has since then given those additional points to veterans that apply for city jobs through civil service. And so I think, you know, the city should be very proud that they implemented that measure. And it's actually not just a municipal code change, but it's actually in it was done by the people of the city with something'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that stands today. So we're really proud of that. I thank you for that clarification by me. And I think it's because we don't slap our own backs every now and then. I mean, that's something that we should always provide in terms of being proud to show that we are taking a very serious view of our veterans and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their service. And for those veterans that are out there, thank you very much for your service. Thank you. We have a motion. Any second. Members, please go ahead and cast your vote to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in this case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And before I go from that, Mr. Modica, is that is that memo report going to come out the next. I know we wanted to get it out before Veterans Day this year. Is that coming out in the next day or two?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, we can get that out in the next day or two and talk about the specific points that are awarded. There's ten points for a veteran. There is 15 points for a disabled veteran. So there's different different benefit levels that we're able to provide to that.'"

    "Recommendation to direct City Manager to work with the Department of Health and Human Services and local mental health providers to explore the feasibility of establishing a more robust infrastructure for mental health services in collaboration and alignment with local mental health providers in Long Beach and the County of Los Angeles.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'So, yes, we can do that. Try remember the year do we do that in 2010? 2010. All right. Thank you. Okay. We have next item that was asked to be moved up was item 45. And this is also by Tommy Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am 45 is a communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman Sunday has Councilwoman Allen recommendation to direct city manager to work with the Department of Health and Human Services and local mental health provider to explore the feasibility of establishing a more robust infrastructure for mental health services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Tonight, I want to introduce a proposal about localizing Long Beach's mental health services. It's an important issue impacting our community. Thanks to my co-sponsors, council members Mary's and De Has and Cindy Allen and thanks to our outstanding city staff, particularly in the Health Department and Kelly Kelly Collopy, Paul Duncan and our senior manager'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Teresa Chandler for their help in the background and helping to shape this proposal. Cities have dealt with a number of issues over the course of the past year. And as we normalize, we have to acknowledge that things have changed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a real opportunity to build back and prepare to face new challenges. I want to lead with this quote from our U.S. attorney general. As things start to get normal. The full brunt of the trauma people, people have been through starts to surface in their lives and they have to deal with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's why I think this is the right time for our country to have a conversation about mental health. So in addition to COVID 19 that we've all dealt with over the course of the past year, Long Beach has been dealing with another, less acknowledged epidemic for quite some time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A mental health epidemic is manifested in many ways elevated suicide rates and drug overdose rates. Our rate of E.R. visits due to mental health crisis was was a full 1%, one in 100 residents from 2017 to 2019. Our rate of visits due to mental health crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me? Our rates of hospitalizations due to self-harm and alcohol abuse are well over the L.A. County average. 2000 of our neighbors are homeless, the majority of whom suffer with mental health issues. The COVID 19 pandemic has only made the situation worse by placing our system under additional stress.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The percentage of adults. Suffering from anxiety or depression has quadrupled during the pandemic. This still remains three times higher than normal. One in three of us suffers from anxiety or depression. Here in Long Beach. The impacts of this pandemic have also been very unequal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'According to the CDC, the mental health impacts of the pandemic have fallen hardest on our youth, and particularly our youth of color. One in 500 children lost a parent during this pandemic, 65% of whom were youth of color.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's why our Racial Equity Reconciliation Initiative under goal for strategy one of advancing health equity calls on the city to increase investment in mental health and trauma services, including facilities, professionals, community responses and culturally tailored resources. As we acknowledge, communities of color face especially high rates of mental illness and psychological trauma.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Moving toward a more locally tailored outreach and service provision can help reduce these inequities. So as Long Beach recovers from the trauma of COVID 19, we have a responsibility to deal with the effects of mental health and well being on our residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's time to reevaluate our capacity to evaluate, to address mental health, mental and behavioral health crises. And despite all of the challenges I just listed, there's hope. Many of the difficulties in Long Beach mental health care system stem from the lack of a venue for a local collaboration between L.A. County Department of Mental Health, who runs our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'mental health services. The city and local providers who influence over policymaking, whose influence over policymaking is limited in this area. This slippage makes program navigation more difficult, which falls especially hard on patients who already have a difficult time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Navigation system is. If you're a local resident, it's hard to know where to go for help. According to Long Beach's homeless management system, just 26%. One in four of people experiencing homelessness who have a disability receive disability benefits just one one out of four.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These benefits could help them buy food, help them buy clothes, secure housing. But the system is difficult to navigate since it allows too many cracks to slip through. I take a local approach. Collaboratively working more closely with the county and possibly taking some of those services in our own hands.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can reduce redundancy and increase access to the services our residents so badly need in this moment. Now, this is not a pipe dream. Many cities in California and other cities around the country operate different ways than we do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city, the cities of Berkeley, Claremont, Pomona, Pomona, Laverne all handle mental health services exclusively at the local level, receiving direct funding from the state of California. That option, they enacted that in the past. That option is not available to Long Beach today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But these cities built their mental health departments before California built theirs. But we can learn from their examples and see that this kind of local provision is not just possible. It's practical. Long Beach has also shown that we have the ability to take on a myriad of services independently under our own portfolio.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We already have our own local health department, the largest independent health department in the state. In addition to our own continuum of care, our own dispatch center, a rich network of hospitals, local mental health service providers, standout educational institutions, our own prosecutor's office and our own police and fire departments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our local infrastructure is strong and we can build upon that to tackle these new challenges. In preparation for this proposal, I brought together local providers, hospitals and our health department, together with Tri-Cities Mental Health, Mental Health, the municipal agency that covers Claremont, Pomona and Laverne for Mental Health Services for a roundtable discussion and brainstorm, try.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cities have had a great deal of success in addressing its dual crisis of COVID 19 homelessness. During 2020, there homeless population dropped by 37%. Tri-Cities was able to share a number of his innovative service models with our panel, including their packed themes and nonviolence response model similar to the REACH teams currently in development here in Long Beach'",

        "'speaker_5': 'our local on our local level. We can add additional residential mental health facilities by looking at partnerships with Major L.A. and our local planning department, including including hospital stepdown beds. We can add more opportunities for trained social workers and nurses in our own community through expanded internship programs, helping to address the crisis right here on front.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can add opportunities excuse me? We can localize our direct response and improve response times. We can streamline program navigation to make sure patients don't slip through the cracks. We can provide for more robust and localized strategies to address drug addiction in our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can improve coordination between existing programs to prevent redundant care and increase access. So I move that we accept this recommendation, ensure that the Health Department identifies the resources needed to engage with local stakeholders and stakeholders and begin this, this study and this process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cities are already taking on today more than they've ever taken on. And and and the truth is, things have changed. There's no going back to the basics. The definition of what we consider a basic need has fundamentally changed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Local government has to evolve to meet that need, and that's what's required to have a modern, resilient city. In Long Beach is ready for that discussion. And I can't wait to see what we come up with. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'This is especially important to discuss now, since issues such as domestic violence and other mental health issues have been referred to as a pandemic within a pandemic. During COVID era, Long Beach song over a thousand more mental health related nine month long calls in 2020 than in previous years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is why I fully support this move toward streamlining all of our local mental health resources to make it easy, easier for our residents to be able to be informed of all the resources that that can be accessible to them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I love most about this item is that it strives to encompass as much as possible. It seeks to find a system in which every individual in need, whether at home, at school, in prison or in jail, can be easily connected with mental health services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it tailors also to include and blend expansion of social work and nurse training and work opportunities for youth. So again, in it is our investment in our youth that will lead us on the right path. One additional thing I'd like to start to consider, and I'm pretty sure you guys are probably already considering this, but I'",
        "'speaker_2': 'want to make sure that we stream all these services and to make it in an equitable way so that we have all the residents have access to them in not only English, but Spanish combined and Tagalog. So thank you very much again, Vice Mayor Richardson, for this item.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'education. And specifically, one of the things that I had asked for on there was the feasibility of having our health department staff funds. 24 seven.

        "'speaker_0': 'in. In December of 2018, I brought an item asking for an audit of the rehab, medical detox and sobriety beds that we have available in the city and within the region. And I looked for it. But I'm not sure if ATF ever came back, but it may have been a report to counsel at some point that came'",
        "'speaker_0': 'back. But I would love to see, you know, while we're talking about taking more direct control over mental health services to know what what resources we have available to us, what what natural partners are already out there that would allow us to not be able to to have to do it on our own.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in 2019, I brought an item that I requested the city do really well, actually was a partnership with CSC Welby to talk about some of our homeless outreach efforts. And they did a lot of analysis on some of the mental health services that we offer that the county offers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm just wondering if some of those proposals specifically could be incorporated into the report that comes back, because I agree with council with Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman, and they have said it would be fantastic for the city to be able to have the capacity to take some of these things on ourselves, because I think we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would be a lot more efficient just simply because we'd have a more targeted and limited scope. And I think that would be beneficial for the city.

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Zoro.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I appreciate you bringing this forward, Vice Mayor. I think it's just so important that we center mental health in this conversation, not just only in the midst of the pandemic pandemic, but just right after our acknowledgment of Veterans Day is making sure that we also dig in a little deeper to serve our community who've experienced'",
        "'speaker_0': 'trauma, whether it's as a veteran through war, also as refugees who experience war. And I think that it's sometimes treated as an afterthought after people have gone through either physical health care services to even social services. It's that it's a last minute thing that we don't think is important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that we need to center this is a piece in that's connected to a variety of health care issue, to service social services. So I really think it's important that we also include more nonprofits because a lot of the burden falls on their shoulder, even to social service organizations, especially those who are serving in other'",
        "'speaker_0': 'languages, because there's very little agencies that have the linguistic also the cultural competency to understand the community and their needs and even how to ensure that we're reducing stigma so that people even feel comfortable even acknowledging that they need services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this has been a constant reoccurring issue when we talk about mental health is how do we reduce the stigma around it in general? And I think that we need to obviously continue to make sure that it's centered and is in the forefront in that that we show that it's important and that we care about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that doing this feasibility study will allow us to engage in that conversation, especially after the pandemic and where so many of us are experiencing things but is invisible and we're not really talking about it. So that's kind of where I'm supportive of this for that reason, and love to be able to ensure that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have a robust conversation, engagement with all those who are service providers, to those even who have had experience in getting mental health services as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions. I would like the city manager to let me know or let us know what he thinks is being asked for tonight in terms of the feasibility studies that that we're bringing in a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it that you're having current city staff bring together subject matter experts? I, I know that this conversation has happened in some prioritization ideas of supervising, and I'm supporting you as the city manager. But I think this also brings to light that over the last.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Five or six years. Lots of different ideas continue to come forward to solve critical issues and to from flaws or feasibility of these other ideas that have come forward. I know come from on price listed a few and I've brought forward a few as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They were just told to be not feasible. And so as times change, I'm not clear if we look back at those or how we recycle. And then another component of this is prioritization. Mental health is huge and it is an amazing opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is also a huge undertaking. Having worked in a county department that has taken on MHC funds in the past, it is a heavy lift, the RFP process, the federal drawdown and our city has done great in some cases of drawing down those federal and state funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we need to make sure that if we're going to do this, it needs to be something that has the staffing and the long term support and the financial support both from the feds or the states in terms of these grants have very, very little admin and they are very heavy on costs associated with the city taking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'them on. And we as a body maybe need to even kind of enroll our Fed Ledge committee and our state large committee on discussing that side of it, to advocate for what it really takes to take on some of these programs in the current society and environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I want to close in stating that we often take on major projects that at the time seem manageable. And I would say that there's many cities throughout throughout our region when you purchase your home, the sidewalk in front of your house and the tree in front of your house, the one city property was your responsibility'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And somewhere along the line, cities took on these responsibilities but did not have the long term capacity to make sure it was done and done well. And so I want to make sure that this is such a critical service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really would love to hear from you how you plan to put your arms around the bigger side of it. I recognize that we've closed out a lot of other ideas along the way, and I think it's also time to really talk about how, within the scope of authority that we have in both our PD and our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our firefighters and the new model that we're bringing through through racial equity and inclusion for responding to needs. How our mental health services. Transitioning and or being more approachable. So I look forward any comment you have at this time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. MODICA Yes. So those are good questions. A couple of things. We will certainly be building on work that we've done in the past. A lot of this work is going on. Our team knows that mental health is one of the biggest issues that we face as we deal with populations experiencing homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have department heads coming together to talk about that, about what else we can get access to. I will say we're also looking at some other opportunities with the new community hospital coming on board. That's been a big thing the council have talked about, too, is are there additional services as they go through their transition that they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can assist with? We've got additional facilities that have been brought into Long Beach. There's the with the acronym Bump on the Bucket The Buck. The Buck, the behavioral health center that is currently in Long Beach. And so we engage with some of those services already.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In terms of doing this, we would certainly go back and look at anything that we've done in the past. So. Consumer prices, right. There's been several items that have explored aspects of this. So we will go look at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So some of our staff can be pulling together those things. We will be of next step and basically putting together what it would cost to do this feasibility and where are we going to get the resources from. We think we may have some federal stimulus money as well that is coming that may be able to help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But then we believe we'd also need some consulting resources as well to really take this on. So next step is really to understand tonight that the council wants to proceed with this. And then we would put together that feasibility report of how we would address it and then get the funding and then move ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the city manager answered one of the questions that I actually had. I think this is a worthwhile endeavor for us to look at. Obviously, mental health is a crisis that affected our city, but the entire region.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love the fact that, you know, there's an example of of collaboration or model to to look at. I'll just tell you, I went to college in Laverne. I lived in Pomona. We in Claremont as well. This is a very different area than the north areas as well and with different needs, I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's good to have a model. Um, um, and I think it's great to always look at ways to enhance our mission, the mission of our health department. Right. And build upon the work that they do and the great work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do. I think, you know, something that was said earlier that that jumped out at me. It was talk was mentioned that that, you know, people don't know where to go to get help. And I think we can start there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our Hope Department should be a clearinghouse of information on mental health. Poor, poor, poor residents to look to opportunities. And I know we have a number of community based organizations and nonprofits that are providing those resources in our in our city as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think they need to be included in that partnership and coordination that we're discussing here. Obviously, funding is an issue, and I want to learn more about where that access and those opportunities are. This sounds like a in a lot of our our goals here at the city council are aspirational.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, if the funding is there, it can be achievable. And so I'm supporting the the item and I look forward to coming back with the feasibility and opportunities to actually act.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And just to provide a little bit of context, Councilmember Alston, you asked about funding the MHC funds in the county of Los Angeles in a ten year period, not very recently, but enough to be reasonable. During my tenure with the 15 years, the county went from 700 million a year to their budget went from 700'",
        "'speaker_0': 'million to 1.9 billion. So, I mean, the amount of funding is remarkable. The challenge is that these agencies are never given. There's two levels of admin, right? You have the admin from the city side and then you out, you contract that service and then there's the admin within those agencies and the very, very strenuous restrictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I know you're on the state led committee, and I'd ask that almost immediately we start advocating or at least discussing with the. The stakeholders, what does it really take and how do we change that at the state and federal level immediately?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because that's impacting our ability to get services from local providers who are currently contractors through L.A. County. And their ability. The number of people who want to apply to provide these services is also a struggle because they they can't run the agency at the level that are necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then you add in the last two years of inflation, I can only imagine what the challenges are. So I'm not on state ledge, but I'm happy to partner with anyone. That is, I'm not on Fed ledge, but I'm happy to partner with anyone that is, and I'm happy to go to any of the roundtables.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is something that's been a passion of mine for almost a decade, and I really feel strongly that there's so many solutions, but the legislative restrictions on the funding has been challenging. So thank you for your insights.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And you know, I would just add at that point that, you know, what I envisioned was something similar to what we have in our continuum of care at a local table. We don't even have a local table to bring everybody together.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that table can help, you know, help identify where the gaps are and where the opportunities are. And in terms of funding, there is more funding at this point than there's ever been to address this issue. And, you know, we've been in recovery for so long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our health department is just now getting back to normal operations. If there's any time to talk about any shifts in how we operate, I think is now. And so I just think it's an incredibly timely conversation. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again. Councilmember Mungo always brings up some of the challenges with with just governance and implementing pro programs. The the funding of the I've mentioned may be there. Oftentimes bureaucracy is in the way in terms of implementation. I'm always concerned about staff capacity to be able to study the feasibility of this and what gets put aside and prioritizing'",
        "'speaker_1': ', you know, what's important to us. I think it's very, very important that this council really engage in terms of understanding where our priorities are in economics and mental health will probably be a high priority for this council, no doubt, and someone who works with our mental health providers on an everyday basis for several years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can tell you that there is a shortage of mental health providers and so some of these plans are that are great in terms of theory, but in terms of execution, it may be very difficult to actually find the providers to actually provide this unless we almost really tweak the system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are shortages of of life, of clinical social workers and psychologists all across the state at this point. And I think in a lot of ways that's going to be part of the crisis that we face, as well as in terms of just making sure that we have the the human resources and capacity to deliver the mental'",
        "'speaker_1': 'health services that we need. So, again, I'm supportive of this right on my back. Thank you, Mayor, for bringing the vision item before us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much to the Council for their conversations. And I see this as in alignment with all the priorities that people have brought forward. I think everyone's contributed. We've talked about homelessness as a top priority. Everyone home identify chronic homelessness and mental health as a significant driver of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked about racial equity and it's in our plan as the number one strategy under advancing health equity. And so these are, in my opinion, they're in alignment. Is there any public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we have three sign up for this item. Well, Desiree Ruth, Mario Ramirez and Rene Castro, please come to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Go ahead and state your name and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, sure. Good evening, Vice Mayor and Council. I am Deborah Ray Rue. I am a licensed clinical social worker and clinical supervisor with century villages of Curio Oasis Residential Services. As Vice Mayor Richardson did. State. Century villages of Cabrillo is in support of this agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Imagine that CVC is a community partner. We provide low income, permanent supportive housing to individuals, families and veterans in Long Beach. Many of our families receive case management and mental health support and other life changing services. So we see firsthand the impact of mental health services and the impact that they have in addressing the behavioral health needs'",
        "'speaker_0': '. They show up as hurdles for housing stability. Likewise, we know sex services increase positive physical and emotional outcomes. So we support this proposal because it will serve as a starting point for which to build strong mental health infrastructure in Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Mario Ramirez and I am a current MSW graduate student at Cal State Long Beach, and I thought it was important to comment. Lynn My support voiced my support for this item agenda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am currently doing an applied project and doing a community assessment and the community that my group is doing is assessing is here in Long Beach District one, the 908 13 zip code and through interviews with residents and stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of their main concerns was barriers to access and lack of access for services, specifically mental health services. And some of the barriers could be language, fear of public charge or just not enough services out there. And so I think it's this agenda, this item is if it comes at a perfect time and hopefully everyone votes on'",
        "'speaker_1': 'it. And I think it's only fitting that that that a couple of days before Veterans Day, a group that, you know, faces mental health challenges, that the council votes on it. And also speaking of Cal State, Long Beach, they have an outstanding social work program, which I'm proud to be a part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they have future social workers who are eager to serve their community, specifically Long Beach, and where a lot of individuals can fall through the cracks. Those social workers can fill those gaps. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Members of the council, my name is Rene Castro. Nice to see you all. It's been a long time since I've been up here. I'm a proud resident of the third district, a social worker, faculty member at California State University in Berkeley, Long Beach, for the past 26 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm totally in support of this item, given all the reasons that really can add more than what the council members have added. Mental health, as you all know, is extremely important to our community. We have the resources and capacity to serve our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do recognize that there are numerous challenges. This is a huge undertaking. But I will say, as the former chair for Mental Health America, Los Angeles, one of the things that I recognize. It took us four years to get reimbursed by L.A. County, donate on our services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if we didn't have a $26 million budget at the time, there's no way. I don't know how agencies survive with four years waiting to be paid. So it's an enormous undertaking. But in Long Beach, with the leadership and diligence of our health department and our partners, as we've seen throughout the pandemic, we had the capacity to'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Karen Riverside and I live at 714 Pacific Avenue in a senior building with 200 other seniors. And one of the things that's missing is the attention to older adults. Older adults are still under the stay at home order, and they've been under a stay at home order for almost two years.'",

In summary, for this item, you gave us specific instructions and we followed all of those instructions. So it's at your pleasure if you want to see the presentation or if you have any questions or if you'd'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just like to proceed with the item. Why don't we go to this? The inclusionary housing item? Do we need the presentation or are we saying no? Maybe. Maybe a short summary and then we'll go from there. Um. Good evening, Mayor and City Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So earlier this year, the City Council adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance and inclusionary housing in the resolution and a no net loss ordinance. And at that time, there were five items that the council asked us to come back and revisit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those are the items that are before you tonight. And as Christopher mentioned, we're recommending that all of those items be included in a revised ordinance and resolution two ordinances and one resolution. And we're able to do all five of those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the first one is to extend affordability covenants beyond 35 years for both ordinances, ensure that the inclusionary and fees are deposited into the housing trust fund and they are used to support the production of new, very low income housing units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we are, instead of revisiting the and Lupi on a three year basis where we're recommending per your request that that be done annually, we're going to remove the 2025 no net loss, no net loss expiration date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we're going to. The one item that we have to adjust is the offsite requirement for the low net loss units. The Council had asked that we remove that, but the city attorney has opined that we can't remove it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Instead, we're proposing that the City Council will be approving any no net loss plans that are outside. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. I think there's one member of the public that wishes to speak also. Yes.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor. Oh, thank you. Councilman. It's getting my levels right. I just wanted to comment in support of any strengthening of this inclusionary housing element here. And I think with respect to especially the Affordable Affordability Covenant being extended, it's imperative that while we create new affordable housing with respect to younger families, we also maintain the covenants that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have in house as a senior amount of our seniors within the city. And as the city becomes more and more of a pricey place for people to live in. These are some of the most marginalized and heavily impacted people when rents increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I commend city staff for recognizing this and taking and taking this into effect with with them ending with respect to the in lieu fee. I think that it's imperative. While it's great to see that there's a housing trust fund to push forward with expanding new housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's imperative that as real estate prices increase, you know, I'm and I'm speaking with the privilege of being a homeowner, you know, my ma my home equity value went up over $180,000 this year alone. With respect to renters, you know, that's just not something that's even feasible or possible because it's defeats the purpose of renting'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So any fees that we're collecting in 2021 should be being applied to preserving affordable housing with respect to a lot of the older buildings, you know, just ten years ago, there was no Deukmejian courthouse there. And it's a lovely building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The presence of that building creates it becomes an economic driver for outside capital investment within the community, pushes people and displaces people. And, you know, the positives often get overrated by the negatives with respect to housing and with these fees that we're collecting, you know, the properties that the real estate is getting more expensive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whatever positive impact that city could do with with respect to affordable housing in a in some small and smaller every year that we don't spend that money, you know, we see what our friends in the Los Angeles with the Prop eight, Prop eight money, you know, they have all that billions of dollars and haven't done anything'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the money in the properties that's increasing. And so we're living in and we're really seeing a flight of people who are low income and even lower middle income who are not being able to afford to leave to live in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so just our hope that we can speed up the process of using this money in lieu fees and no net loss element as well to just push for more affordable housing in the city. But I appreciate the city for amending the municipal code for the future.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'No, I support Councilman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any comments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I yes, I thank you very much. I appreciate your comments as well. You know, since the day I got elected and I put my big old fight 11 feet on this diocese, my number one priority was affordable, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And everyone should have the ability to be able to afford to live in the city. You know, I just met again this week with a bunch of housing advocates and and I'm always open and listening to how we can strengthen our policies and how we create more affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm always committed to that. And I really want to say thank you to staff for all of your hard work on this. I just really appreciate you and for taking I mean, and thinking about all of the changes that we were asking that you incorporate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So really appreciate I really appreciate you and just happy to support this today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you to Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You, Mr. Mayor. So we've gotten I think all the council members have gotten some concerns from. People that are interested in this topic regarding moderate housing and what we're doing in this policy to incentivize moderate housing. And I know that that's something that we've talked about a little bit on the council in terms of workforce housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So not at that very, very low level, but at that moderate level. And the criticism of the proposal tonight by some has been that it doesn't take into account the need for the city to incentivize moderate housing. So can you talk to me a little bit about that and help me understand that that concern?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure you've also heard the concern and what your thoughts are about it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember We are currently working with a consultant to prepare a party guidelines for middle income housing, workforce housing. I believe when we had the auctioneer come to, to the council council elected to have that, that particular project as a pilot program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you had directed us to prepare a policy. So we'll be coming back to you with that shortly. And with a series of policies and priorities, recommendations for you on middle income strategies. And I would add councilmembers specifically on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was one of the policy options that we had brought to the council, probably three different areas where we looked at a moderate model, we looked at kind of a moderate, low income model, and then we looked at a very low income model.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And council had a lot of fierce debates at the time, and we went with the model that you see today. So that was kind of a larger policy item that was discussed with the options and this was what ultimately was successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And when did that item when did it first come to us for that designation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, I believe or Jan was one of the votes and then it came back again in February of 2021. So it was right at the beginning of the year, if I remember right. July of 2020 is when the first proposal came and then the vote was in in January 2021 and then again in February 2021.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, and I think and thank you for that refreshing of my recollection regarding the priorities. We have had some changes in council since we started to first discuss this policy. And and so I think it's worthy of mentioning I think for many of us, workforce housing and moderate income housing is really important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we want to be able to make sure that the people who are working in our city can afford to live in our city. And, you know, working in and most of our traditional workforces right now would not provide the type of income that people need to live in the city, at least with the prices the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'way they are now. So I just want to be mindful of that. I think a lot of us that are having children entering into adulthood envision a world where they're able to live in the city and afford to live in a city with whatever salary comes out of their bachelor's degree if they should get one or a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'degree. And as it stands, there's just absolutely no way, no way on a on a salary of somebody with an A or a bachelor's and a traditional job. I understand there are some creative industries out there, but for the most part, just the earning, the return on the earning power of someone with a bachelor's or an AA'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is such that they couldn't afford to live here. So I'm very concerned about that issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Price, some members of the council, I really think that's next week's discussion. So I just want to focus, that's all on inclusionary housing as one tool among various different housing tools that the city is using to address different housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're in front of you next week for an agenda item related to the housing element. We were in front of you recently for an item related to density bonus. So there are different tools. There's the CDA model, that Oscar reference.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's different tools for different needs. I think in in the view of staff, the inclusionary item in the housing trust fund is, is focused on that very low income housing. But that's not to say we aren't addressing middle income housing in other ways with other tools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think next week may be a better time to have that that fuller discussion. And that's when we're going to be talking about housing policy and kind of strategy in general as part of the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's wonderful. Thank you for sharing that with me and refocusing me on that because I think it's important and we have a very diverse city and it's important we have tools to address all the needs. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Catherine. Margo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I look forward to next week's discussion, but I also just want to thank the staff for their work on this so far. There's a lot of different advocacy groups and. I appreciate all the letters that we receive and very supportive of moderate housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually went to a regional meeting of data and there was a presenter, like I said before, COBR now that kind of talked about the utilization of the resources and what that looks like across a region. And the speaker was from L.A. City, and they kind of looked at a a heat map.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'd be really interested in learning where certain types of housing, specifically moderate housing, could be best utilized and fit into the neighborhood. So I know Chris and I have had this discussion before, and I look forward to next week's discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate my colleagues comments and the letters from all advocates on all sides. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I have some comments, but I'll go back to basically Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just I had a thought based on this discussion. I do remember, I think when we talked about this earlier this year, there was a discussion about the ownership. And I think we spoke to we reserve all the middle income, the modern income on the ownership portion of the inclusionary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How that. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. All the inclusionary units that are ownership are moderate income.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And I'm certainly sensitive to the discussion about moderate income. And I do remember a healthy discussion we had about getting people into homeownership who are, you know, maybe have middle income. We want an only density given opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked about inclusionary housing is one tool to downpayment assistance, another tool and a whole host of things. So I look forward to a more robust conversation about downpayment assistance, other things. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Are the mikes working okay? I can barely hear the council. Just so you know, up here. I guess. I don't think we can hear each other at least. Okay. No, no problem. I just want to just add first, I think staff, this is actually an enormous policy that staff is working on for years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'First, discuss, I think, with all of us after we put together a group of developers, business folks, housing folks to come up with a lot of many ideas around housing, talked about the state of the city, got brought to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just think it's important also because I agree with every that's been said particularly about workforce housing. The the architecture of this policy was negotiated deeply with the development community, with the Chamber of Commerce at the time, but most probably with the housing with housing advocates.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And everyone kind of came to the table and came up with a policy that that not everybody loved, but that absolutely leaned into the most important piece of it, which is setting aside units and every new development that we build that would be affordable at different levels, especially for low income folks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this was viewed as and I believe it is a absolute step forward, an important step forward so that every single development in the city that's built includes housing affordability built into it, so that folks that are low income, very low income, are able to live in spaces that are shared and in with all types of folks'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And the end is development. So this is a huge step forward for for the city. And I'll also add in talking to some, I have had some some folks reach out to me and ask for changes. And I did remind some of those folks that those were some of the same folks that were in many meetings with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'me a couple of years ago when we negotiated this proposal that were that said, okay, let's go with this proposal. So I'm very comfortable moving forward tonight, and I want to thank staff for all of their all of their work.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I think we all are and have been very supportive of our cap, which is an incredible document that's been developed at the city. And and it's obviously really focused on issues that we are concerned with as it relates to climate, the climate crisis in front of us globally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But here locally, there's been a lot of conversation nationally about getting and creating climate cause at the federal level and at the state level. There are a handful of municipal youth climate courses that are. No. No. Is it on?'",

Let me start over, I guess. What I what I was saying is that right now there are a handful of municipalities across the country and certainly at'",

        "'speaker_1': 'or in climate adaptation programs in their communities. Now, with the proposal we have in front of us is is a group of mayors from California had asked Governor Newsom to add about $150 million in the budget to fund programs in the 13 largest cities in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it was part of a group of mayors that advocated for this funding in this last budget. The governor did include about $150 million to support youth workforce programs in California for the 13 largest cities. That means that Long Beach would receive about $6.3 million in funding for youth development programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As mayors, we came together and also made the decision that we wanted to fund youth development programs as it relates to climate protection and create these youth climate cause up and down the state of California. These would be workforce development programs for youth employment, youth careers and climate service, strengthening capacity for programs that already exist, and also'",

I want to also that what the request actually is is not approve the full proposal tonight, but the send the resources and a sketch to the climate change committee of the council and to have them work'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the community to get ideas and to see what the structures should look like and how the and how the program could look, could work. And then for the committee to come back to the Council with recommendations on what the Youth Climate Corps could actually look like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will add that this is a significant amount of dollars, $5 million to start for a program like this is is a great start. And so we're grateful for these resources. And the additional 1.3 million is going to be used for use by staff for some admin issues, but also to strengthen some of the other workforce programs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that I think already exist in the city, if I'm if I'm not mistaken. So I think Mr. Monica will come forward on those issues. So we have the ability to really develop this program as as we would like to and as the community would like to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I want to make sure we get started and send this over to the Climate Action Committee of the City Council to create the Long Beach Youth Climate Corps program. With that, there's a motion and a second. Let me start with Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I just thank you, Mayor, for introducing this item and for all your efforts and bring funding for these forward thinking programs. And the the climate crisis can be tackled by the leadership of our future generations of our young people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this funding is just a tremendous way and transformative way, transformative weight for our entire community. So I love the focus of these dollars on expanding job training for the youth, and I think it will be essential part of a just transition for developing career pathways as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as chair of the Climate Action Environment Committee, I can't wait to discuss this in the committee and just thank you, Mayor, for all of your hard work in securing this funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Count, Councilman. Sorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for bringing this item forward. I just think it's just so crucial that we work on this. I just want to uplift the statement that's in your letter to the city council that this is indeed a wonderful opportunity to expand upon the work we do with the Conservation Corps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach. They have the experience, resources and expertize to bolster and scale the services that they currently provide to the city. And they have a waiting list of young people, including many that are from my district, eager to join and serve the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they've done so pretty much for the whole city. I think that there isn't an area that they haven't touched to make sure that they provide environmental stewardship. And I think they can do so much more to continue to help us combat climate change and meanwhile, providing workforce development opportunities for our youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate this and hope that, you know, they'll be engaged and part of the discussion as it gets developed. So thank you so much.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I think this is a great program. Thank you for your advocacy at the state level to prioritize the big cities. I think it's in alignment with all the things you mentioned, our climate action adaptation plan measure us, our commitment to climate and our commitment to youth and the upcoming youth fund that's rolling out'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I echo I think we have some great partners in your conservation cause building a facility in North Long Beach as we speak, to make a deeper commitment to Long Beach. And so we need to definitely support and work work with them on that effort.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also want to say that with everything ahead of us in terms of climate and the, you know, the end of oil as we know it, it's the future is really going to lean on STEM and in how we design and create a more resilient, sustainable future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I know a lot of times when we talk about a climate corps in youth, we're talking about teenagers. But I want to make sure that, you know, we engage with the little ones and we engage in their we inspire little ones, elementary school kids in some way into this process so that they are inspired by'",
        "'speaker_5': 'STEM and take interest in the things that Long Beach is doing and how we prepare them for what's what's ahead. Because this, you know, talking about climate is really talking about their future. So the more we can engage the little ones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm hoping that the Climate Committee can really think about some sort of a recommendation to partner with schools for the little ones. But I think this is a great proposal and I look forward to supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Yeah. Let me just add one thing that to add to that, Vice Mayor and I think one of the when we're looking at we're getting guidelines from the state on flexibility of the dollars. But one small example where a even a small amount of dollars goes a long way is we have so many requests from Long'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach Unified, for example, of these classrooms, of these kids that come together to try to fund these small projects in the community that are climate related. And I'm just I mean, with a few resources, those projects and those kids go through an incredible experience.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So whether those types of projects can be part of this broader, you know, youth Climate Corps program, I'm not sure. But I think that that's an idea that I think can be engaged with with the community and to see if something that would fit our work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot. A lot of my colleagues have already mentioned it, but obviously it's no secret. I'm a huge fan of the Conservation Corps. I share an office with them. And one of the things that I was recently talking with their director about was that in some areas and this is something I'd love to be considered as this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'move through committee is some cities have or some jurisdictions areas have district wide corps teams. And so they'll have a conservation corps like in the city of Long Beach. There could be nine of them, and they could do climate projects, environmental projects that are specific to that district, whether it's a planting project or any type of project'",
        "'speaker_0': ', a cleanup project, whatever. But it could be district specific and the Corps could have a team of youth that would work with that district on imagining some options for resiliency and climate action, and they can help implement it through the community and things of that nature.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I really hope that's something we can think about. I feel like that's a structure that would be creative and would help us engage youth from all over the city in different parts of the city. A project might be one thing in one district and totally different and another, but still accomplish the same overall purpose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that really contributes to the beauty and the diversity of the city if we have something like that. So I'm hoping that whoever on the staff is taking charge of this as it goes through committees, that that's something we consider as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman House.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Thank you for this amazing opportunity and bold and necessary move for our leadership in state capital that recognizes the need to prepare a workforce that accounts for climate change adaptation. The youth are leading the way towards cleaner, a brighter future that protects our environment and our planet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it is our responsibility as current leaders to support them and equip them with all of the resources they need to be successful and to be able to continue to save our future. I'm very supportive of all youth empowerment programs, but especially of the youth programs focused on climate adaptation efforts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you again for this program. Thank you for giving the youth a space where they can empower themselves to make positive change in this industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Madam, quickly. I think we have members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we have six speakers. Teresa marino, Don Knapp, Dave Sugar, Kenny Allen, Michelle Lewis and Elliott Gonzalez. Please come to the podium. Teresa moreno. Good evening, honorable mayor and honorable vice mayor and.'",

So I thank you for this opportunity to come forward and just speak a little bit about the Corps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our history in terms of 35.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Years of service with the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City of Long Beach and being a partnering agency and and always having a.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So that any department in the city can work with us. We started.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_0': '15 Corps members. Our first corps members were hired in 1989. And over the last 33 years, we've served more than 10,000 youth with workforce development, skills, training, education and service and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stewardship to the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you, Mayor Robert Garcia, for putting the Conservation Corps in your letter and looking at us in terms of a partner, maybe a consulting agency, in terms of we have infrastructure, we have a holistic approach of working with young people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our core members are 18 to 25 years old, but we also do afterschool programs with younger students. And we also have a model of clean and green, which was for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Smaller.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Youth corps, younger youth members, and it was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Instituted and used by the L.A. Corps model, the Conservation Corps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've done a lot of projects in the communities. We've done neighborhood cleanups. We've done conservation. We've done recycling solar installation. Stewardship, education, about the environment and many more. We work with the neighborhoods and the business districts and all city departments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in looking at this allocation, we hope that will be at the table. We hope that will be a model. We hope that we can help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Others so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That they don't have to reinvent the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Wheel, but can see a model.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That that work that has history and experience here in the city of Long Beach and that have corps members that are out in the community working, but also very diverse young people of every strata of economic in our communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Working with us will save money because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You will not have to start from scratch. You won't have to reinvent the wheel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are. I have our boots on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our young people are ready. We have many.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Crews.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have about 80 corps members right now and we have a long waiting list. So thank you for your time and thank you all for this opportunity. Don Knapp.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. And that's Dan Knapp. So good to see everybody. Mayor City Council again, thanks, mayor, for representing while you were up there with the the coalition of big city mayors. You know, we have our own association in California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Car Conservation Corps is called Cal California Association Conservation Course. And we were also talking to the governor's office, working with California volunteers, Josh, Friday up there on on how is this climate money going to trickle down and how is it going to get to the communities that need it the most?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Working with the resources agency, with the secretary, Wade Crowfoot as well. So we're right there with you. We want to bring as many resources as possible to the city, to the young people we serve, and not the director of the corps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I work for the young people that we serve, and I really strongly believe that. And that's why I'm here tonight. We're also right now, we belong to a larger national association. We're working to ensure that the President Biden's civilian climate corps, those dollars, those resources come to the community of Long Beach and help bolster what we're already'",
        "'speaker_1': 'doing. As Theresa said, it's pretty crazy right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We pay a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Little bit above minimum wage for young folks coming to our. We pay above minimum wage just a little bit, though. We have a waiting list of young folks trying to join the corps and we're competing against Amazon, you know, 20 bucks an hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All these other jobs, they want to come here, they want to serve. We couldn't be prouder of our young folks talked about, you know, mental health. We have our own support services department for our young folks who come to our doors to help them with anything that whether it's housing, mental health, parenting, what have you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also have a very robust academic programs. As Theresa said, we can bring resources to the table. But we're always looking for more resources. This kind of money could help the Corps develop new partnerships with the young folks back here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love that. I can't wait to talk with them, work with other organizations, help mentor, perhaps help guide, because we've been doing this for a while. We have resources, but we also want to, you know. Engage as many young folks as we can within in Long Beach, so serve the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It'd be cool to have a team in every council district made up of young folks from that council district doing work. But at the same time, young folks are coming to our doors because they get to go to Catalina Island and work or do Clement work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The fuel reduction in the local national forest, the clearing, the Angeles National Forest. We're doing work on chat lines. We just started a new project at the SEAL Beach Wildlife Refuge working with the sea turtles there. That's why young folks come to our doors because they know we care and we want to build that with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So again, thanks for including us, Mayor. Thanks for the council. We look forward to working with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kenny Allen, Michelle Lewis and Elliott Gonzalez. Please come to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, City Council. Mr. Mayor. My name is Kenny and I am a resident of the Second District here to speak on behalf of Sunrise Movement. Long Beach. First, I'd like to thank you for advocating for these funds and congratulate you on being one of the cities to receive these funds from the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also like to thank you for considering that this money might be well spent in the enormous amount of mitigation and adaptation work we have to do to address the climate emergency here in Long Beach. Sunrise Movement has been deeply engaged at the federal level, advocating for something called the Civilian Climate Corps to be included in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'build back better package that is awaiting a vote in Congress right now. We see this as a key program required to kick off the decade of the Green New Deal and provide good union jobs and meaningful work to millions of Americans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you receive this one time funding from the state, we have three brief points of public input to offer. One of the jobs provided by this Youth Climate Corps must provide a living wage and benefits, and the work must actually pave a path to meaningful, long term career opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two. When hiring for these positions, the communities most impacted by the climate crisis should be prioritized. This includes, but is not limited to youth living among along the diesel death corridor. Bipoc youth and youth who have come into contact with our systems of incarceration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Finally, we strongly urge the city to look closely at the Civilian Climate Corps program proposed by Senator Ed Markey, as well as the Green New Deal for Cities Act that has been introduced in the House. Having a longer term plan for the work ahead will better position us to receive major funding from the Federal Government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We highly recommend you utilize this initial funding to make our city more eligible for this desperately needed federal funding. My generation is ready to roll up our sleeves and get to work building a world beyond fossil fuels. A world that centers care and community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Michelle Louis and I'm a lifelong resident of District Second District and a member of the Sunrise Movement, Long Beach. Congratulations on being one of the cities successful in securing this funding from the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We look forward to hearing the details about how these funds will be invested in our community to address the climate emergency. I'd like to tell you a bit more about the vision for the Civilian Climate Corps, which is a federal program awaiting a vote as part of the build back better package.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We hope this vision of a, c, c, c might inform the way you develop this local youth climate corps. Imagine a world where millions of people, recent high school graduates and middle age alike, could work on projects protecting communities from sea level rise, taking care of the elderly, distributing fresh produce and food deserts, restoring wetlands and rebuilding'",
        "'speaker_0': 'after climate disasters while getting paid a living wage, having access to health care and getting apprentice to continue their career. That is the vision of the Civilian Climate Corps, and it goes far beyond just planting trees. We should use this opportunity, this funding, to actually build back better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you need help figuring out how to do this the right way, we are here and ready to work with you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good afternoon. Members of the city council. Honorable Mayor. I'm here to speak in support of the Youth Climate Fund. However, there are some ideas I have for this how this process can be improved. First, I would like to ask the council members to reach out to organizations already working on youth climate jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Organizations such as Sunrise Movement, which has been active in advocating for a civilian climate corps, which is a jobs program to put people to work, especially young people doing some of the most important work there is to be done that is taking care of this earth and taking care of one another.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's also a student led Green Campus Club at Poly High School. If there is a sincere effort to provide a youth climate fund, the youth voices should go into shaping such a program. I would like to ask the council to adopt a polluter pays model to secure a long term funding source for this Youth Climate Fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This funding can be generated by, one, increasing taxes, such as the oil tax, which was recently implemented, and two, also implementing fees on oil drilling. Those who are most responsible for creating this crisis should be the ones to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The oil tax was originally proposed as a way to speed up the phase out of of oil. Increasing the tax can bring additional revenue from the lucrative oil industry and help fund good paying jobs, cleaning up some of the city's most polluted regions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The residents near the these pollution sources, oil drilling refineries, gas facilities are on the are the frontline communities who bear the hardest burden of pollution. And they should be the first in line to receive these jobs by placing fees on the oil industry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can hold this the city's largest carbon emitter accountable too, for its responsibility to provide funding for living wage jobs as directed by the community, most importantly, by the youth. Finally, I'd like to ask that the Council use the Council Offices, the Climate Committee of the City Council and the Sustainability Commission to gain the vision of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'community. The community held a vision for it, for the transition. I believe in the youth and the young adults who are going to be the first to inherit the climate crisis. Their voices should go into providing the vision for the type of work to be done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have the ability to secure the funding, to hold the oil industry accountable. They are the ones who are willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that they have a livable future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If sugar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Thank you for letting me speak last. I am someone who has misspent his youth in the climate justice movement. I have literally aged out. I have gray hair. I have been doing this in some form or another for the past 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can remember not only James Hansen's testimony before Congress in 1998, but telling my mother not to use VO5 hair spray because of the aerosols and the CFC spec when the Montreal Protocol was being designed. I have a lot of thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Conservation Corps program idea was something that we advocated for when we organized the first National Green Jobs Day of Action back in September of 2008. It's a good program. My congratulations for the state funding and for your continued support of the Climate Action Plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I sincerely hope that the youth that are have spoken as well as are listening to this will also stick around for item 58, which directly bears on how much space your future may or may not have in this town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been trying to do my best. Perhaps it's appropriate to be a bit more explicit about my goals and methods. As much as these comments are directed at them, they're really for you. They're to you. I'm of buy for from someone from UGA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So some thought having cause in each and every district is a good idea. I support that idea that these jobs should be informed by climate adaptation, environmental justice, best principles, starting with prioritizing the most disadvantaged communities. These jobs should be career path, and they should focus on existing statutes like SB 100 and SB 1000 and other laws'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that, you know are going to be part of a livable future. It'd be unfortunate if a lot of these jobs became ways to prioritize city trash filler into a fuel source or to prop up fossil fuel jobs that really don't have any future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in the time that I have, if anyone would like to get started on a project. Prove or disprove the following propositions. Over the past 100 years, the City of Long Beach has one of the largest historical attributable emission loads profiles of any municipality in the Northern Hemisphere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These emissions can be calculated as much from the existing data and back facing estimates, as well as various social and political developments that the city has exported worldwide. Institutional mechanisms like the division in Signal Hill and Lakewood, Levittown town of Suburban Development to you growth overvalue growth in the port.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that historical responsibility is somewhere between two and 4% of all climate forcing in all climate disasters worldwide. From here on and bonus question which actuaries institutional thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You your time is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The financial advisors would help you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I want to thank all the other folks that came for public comment. I do want to add that it was mentioned and I think I maybe should have leaned on this piece a little more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is certainly to the committee and to the chair. The idea is that this program would align with the federal civilian corps that is being currently discussed right now. So I want to make sure that I know I mentioned it, but that is it's a current proposal that's right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Had a lot of vetting at the federal level. And the idea is that this program would align with that program. And so it would serve as an opportunity for us to get ready for hopefully that federal program and those dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There will be also additional state dollars for this program we expect in the future. So that should be a big part, hopefully, of a conversation that happens at at the committee. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My only question regarding that is the funding that would be coming down from the state or the feds. Do we know if there's going to be any supplementing restrictions on it? Because I don't know how we would be able to ensure that we could then add to it, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't. Just something to talk about for our administrative team because nearly every grant in the last 12 months has had this new clause. And I don't want us to be disqualified by opening an area that we can't close and reopen or expand.'",

We do expect that there will be some continuing data releases over the over the next several months of data that's not available now.'",

        "'speaker_1': '. So before we jump into that data, I just want to do a quick recap on the timeline and activity of the census. The census 2020 census was historic and unusual in a variety of ways, but most notably, it was impacted by the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so just let me just just if we don't mind. Is Mr. Cordero here for something? Is he here for the item? Yes, he's here for the item on container stacking. Why don't we just see him and then Dr. Hasegawa here also.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And that's going to spill out. We're going to see that there's capacity going to be needed in the area surrounding the port all the way out to an inland empire. That's it. I think for a period of 90 days it makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we have to have a real conversation about is this really a 90 day deal? If they're in if if there's an indication that it moves beyond 90 days, there needs to be some public engagement in the neighborhoods surrounding these facilities.'",

So picking up where we left off, you know, there's the sense is there was is historic for many reasons but the pandemic obviously had a significant impact on the operations of the census and particularly the the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The schedule was extended from its attention to its initial timeframe from July 31st to October 31st, and then abruptly ended on October 15th at the behest of the last administration, despite the challenges with the pandemic. We're proud of the fact that we were still able to leverage significant and historic investment from the state and collaborate with the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'state and the county for a city wide effort in implementing the census successfully. And foundational to that, or the centerpiece of that was to work with the community through the Long Beach Complete Count Committee, consisting of about 45 different local institutions representing the business sector, the health sector, educational sector, as well as community based organizations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that said, we had our project manager with Julius renewed. He did a wonderful job working with us in the community and the organization to move this initiative forward. And so I'm going to turn it over to Julian, and he will walk us through the data that we have to present tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Kevin. So to begin with, looking at the data we have here for the year 2010, we had a total population that were counted through the census of 406 to 2257. And in 2020, we have a total population enumerated of 466,742.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that is a net gain of 4485 residents. So that's about a 1% growth over ten years. To the right of that table, you'll see the graph that represents the 2020 population by race and ethnicity. So you'll see that Hispanic or Latino group is at 43.3%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now white population is 26.1, black population 2%, American Indian at 0.2, Asian at 12.7, Native Hawaiian at point eight and other 8.6. And then two or more races at 4.3%. The next slide also presents a citywide 2020 2020 census data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As for the ethnicity question in the questionnaire, though, what this shows here is that from 2010 to 2020, there was a decrease of 2% in a population that identified as non-Hispanic or Latino, and from 2010 to 2020. The study experienced a 2.9% increase in the population that identified as Hispanic or Latino.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the big takeaway from this slide really is that it's telling us that the city of Long Beach continues to increase its population in the Latino community. This next slide is we think is a very interesting slide. So it is a city wide 2020 census data by race response.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the chart here represents the city's race distribution across the races included in the census questionnaire, which are white, black, American, Indian and Alaska, Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander and then some other race as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From left to right. So for each race category, let's take the white category, for example. The center column you see there represents the resident that identified only as that specific race. And then the rightmost bar represents residents that identified as that race in combination with another race.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the first column on the left, meaning the dark blue column, then represents the total number of residents that identified by that race. In this example, white both either in part or in whole. The good. The interesting takeaway from this slide is that our residents really, if you can see on the far right under some of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'race that residents are identifying as having more than one race than ever before. And with that, you know, to understand that, we'd really have to do some more weight on there, more released from the Census Bureau, and also to conduct additional resources to why that might be the case about an interesting finding there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm moving on to the next slide. The next slide is the top table titled Race of non-Hispanic People. What that table does is that it breaks down the citywide population by race for non-Hispanic residents. So as you can see in the far right column title, percent change that there are less residents who are identified as non-Hispanic'",
        "'speaker_1': 'whites and Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic American, Indian and Alaskan alone, and also non-Hispanic native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander on. So for the race categories, Asian alone, some other race alone in two or more races categories, those have actually increased.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So now moving to the bottom table on this is also an interesting finding here of the preliminary the preliminary data on. Here. The table titled Race of Hispanic People really reveal some interesting information. So from 2010 to 2020, both censuses, there was a 64.6% drop in Hispanic residents who identified as white alone so equal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interesting also is that there's a significant increase of 178.9% in the American Indian and Alaska Native alone category. And there's also a really sharp increase of 300% in the residents who identify as being of two or more races.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So moving to the next slide, slide number seven. On Flight number seven. It really shows the same information as the previous slide, but it shows it in nominal terms. So it gives you the actual number of residents here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can see the percentages translated into the actual number. So you can see that almost 50,000 more residents are identified as white Hispanics in 2010 than in 2020. On the other hand, there's also a net gain, as you see at the bottom, second and third, third row from the bottom that there's a 24,000 and family residents who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'identified as some other race alone and a gain of 35,577 residents. Who identified as belonging in two or more races. So, you know, you might have some interesting questions at this point in time, for example. Comparing the data, you can see some interesting questions may arise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So for example, like, you know, what has caused the drops in residents that identify as alone a white alone Hispanics? What has caused the increase in the number of residents who identified as some of their race alone and two or more races?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, you know, might there be a connection between this kind of enumeration that happened the 2020 census? So these are certainly intriguing and interesting questions. And again, we would kind of have to wait to see additional datasets being released by the census to see what is actually happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, a more local level, we probably would want to see some studies to understand how they're related and why this is happening. So moving to flight number eight. So we're going to move into just more census data by council districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So now that the citywide data has kind of been reviewed from a high level, we also do that on a council district level for you. So to begin with here on Slide nine or really what you see here is just a table slide that represents the same information that you'll see on the following slide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At this table here includes the columns for a nominal population, data for the 2010 and 2020 censuses, and those are the second and third columns from the left. So here's a map that kind of represents that for you visually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What you see here is that the visually, the darker blue a district appears, the larger the population. Gaining experience from the 2010 to 2020 census is the district. And in contrast, districts appearing lighter mean that there was a loss in population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you'll see there's even a couple of districts there that have gone from a light blue to, you know, almost like a light red, indicating a loss in population. So the take away from this visual here is that districts one in six have lost the most population, while districts five, seven and eight have gained the most populations'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Meanwhile, districts two, three, four and nine have remained largely the same or experienced some modest growth. Slide number 11 is represents here a pie chart that represents a district's population broken down by race and ethnicity. And this slide really has value because it allows you to very quickly determine which districts have large and small populations of a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'certain race or ethnicity. And it's really good to do a quick comparison if you want to add longer between certain districts to see how they differ in race and ethnicity. This is just an additional slide here, table for your reference.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, it just represents the exact same information as the previous slide, but in the table format, in case you really kind of want to dig in there into the numbers. Slide number 13 shows the percent change by race for each district from 2010.'",
        "'speaker_1': '2020. I'm sorry, can you just go back to slides really quick, too? There we go. It's one. Make sure I'm reading this right. So let's take Council District one or two. So 59.3 is the Latino Hispanic population, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's not the citizen voting age population. It's just a total population. Correct. Total population. There's a census to see VAP or the just does total population. They'll do they'll do both. They do total population. Also 18 plus. Okay, 18 plus the c bap include 18 plus non-citizens or C that includes all voting population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See, that includes all voting population. Yeah, not. Not. Not, uh. Include all voting population, but including undocumented or including folks that are that are not counted as as as voters. I've always wondered about that, about the census, the way that that presents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So from our understanding, the questionnaire asked, You know what? You are born and raised from there it is how they decipher your age. So it it's citizen voting age population, correct? Yeah, that's. Yeah. Because there is. You might remember that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Um, the citizenship question, which was not on the questionnaire. So going back to fight number 13, it shows the change by race for each district from 2010 to 12 and 20. The interesting pattern here that emerges across all districts, if you can see the father's two columns, is that there are significant percent increase'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of residents that selected other or two or more races. And so this is something that also would be interesting to look at in the future as the census continues to release information. And then slide number 14. This just shows the same information as the previous slide, but this table really shows more clearly the percent increases in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'other race and the two or more races. And because in the previous slide, those bars were actually truncated just for I'm for a graphic and visual effect. But you can see here that feeds 1 to 6 and eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, I experienced the largest increases coming near or above a 200% growth in the category of other race. As we begin to wrap up here. Slide number 15. This shows the nominal change by race and ethnicity for each district from 2010 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this graph shows the actual number of people gained or lost in each district by race and ethnicity. So contrasting this graph with the previous graph on the percent changes graph, one can see that although the other and two or more races categories appear significantly percent increases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Normally the growth is smaller. So just a quick comparison. You see the last two columns there in each council district graph are very high, indicating a high increase percentage wise. Nominally they are a lot smaller. But what you do see here is that the white and the Latino categories do not appear as dramatic percent increases in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'previous table, but nominally on this slide. There is a significant gains and losses in the number of residents that identified as Latino or white from 2010 to 2020. So you almost kind of see the opposite as far as the height and decrease of the bars there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, this here is also, just for your reference, is the same information provided in the previous graphs. And with that being said, you know, kind of the big four takeaway here is that we can glean from the initial information is that Long Beach is becoming more Hispanic or Latino.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Long Beach white population has decreased in contrast to the 2010 census. The Long Beach black population has also decreased. And then lastly, is that interesting pattern that continues to show in the data, which is that more residents are identifying with the other race and the two or more racist categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just a special thank you to Neish, who was the information systems officer and his two interns that were critical in helping us to gather that data for you to present today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for that presentation.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I think the way that city staff put it out was an excellent opportunity to see district by district what is what, what is, what is current and what is going on. I think that it's very imperative, especially now with respect to the, you know, the controversial term of the night, the redistricting process, where these things are looking'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in and where they're going. So I appreciate the presentation and I will definitely be reviewing. I personally noticed and this is according to U.S. Census data, the self-reporting increase. But a lot of the household report's due to, obviously, COVID in the pandemic said family drop in in marginalized communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just hoping that we can see some update from the feds with respect to that. I know specifically for in my neighborhood and the 200 block of BURNETT, there was only one apartment building that was visited by a census worker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so a lot of the undocumented undocumented community in my neighborhood, sadly, were not counted. But, you know, as we know with the census, they do a over a count, an undercount over and under to count the you know, to cover this basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But with respect to the census, it's imperative that these numbers are as close to the current population as possible, because this is how we do Medicaid and Medicare and Section eight and all of these federal programs that really make or break a trajectory for a lot of these families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in any case, thank you for this staff report and we'll be reviewing.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Through our field operations, both in Los Angeles County, including the city of Long Beach, now had a data collection. The bureau identified four key innovation areas, which included re-engineering and just canvasing, optimizing salt response, utilizing administrative records and third party data as well as rendering field operations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, as a result of the pandemic, adjustments were made to the data collection, most notably along the calendar, as well as the schedule. Now. The coffee, manage the processing of data, and work to deliver high quality, defensible data as close to possible statutory deadlines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, despite the aforementioned challenges, as well as in concluding data collection, the 2020 census was still able to verifiably count over 99.9% of addresses nationwide. Now I highlight this aspect as essential as a unique identifiers for the establishment of dwellings correlate directly to street addresses which comprise the local data census addresses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, while carrying out my data collection duties, I found there to be difficulty not only making contact with a resident of a dwelling lacking an address, but in many of these cases, contact cannot be made within multiple visits, and attempts for proxy were insufficient now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that also took place with multiple agents across multiple operations, including an initial house unit. Follow up as the non-response follow up as well. Most households across the nation received an invitation to respond to the census by mail during the week of May 12.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'We do need to do our best as a city to ensure all dwellings receive unique identifiers and I can see that possibly being encouraged by the participation of the accessory dwelling unit amnesty program and for marginalized communities are included ahead as well as are communicated with the deadlines as they change.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. I spoke earlier on the Senate calendar about this issue of integrity, of information. I think with the census data, it is absolutely imperative, I believe, that the 2011 and 2010, as well as 2020 decennial census have undercounted our city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe that at any given time there are over 500,000 residents in the city, which should be considered a major city. There's a growing body of literature about how this information specifically affected the ability of census enumerators to do their job.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that the city will support efforts by the Census Bureau to make specifically spreading disinformation about the census a crime. And I'd also like to see the city do everything it can to support efforts for the next American Community Survey.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. With that, Katherine Austin, any comments? Yeah, I did. I just wanted to comment. I thought this was pretty fascinating. And in my opinion, it's clear that there was an undercount in the census and that there were some bizarre shifts in racial identification.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I love to learn more about how and why that was. And I guess one question that comes to mind is, were there any differences in the questions from 2010 to 2020 in terms of or for that particular category?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the categories remain the same. What did change out? A big change. Ever since 1800s, the questionnaire was in paper form. So we were a limited number of character boxes that you could use to identify your race by in the move to a digital era.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They moved to Internet based questionnaire, so that allowed for, I believe, was about 120, 130 characters. So I think from the ability of a resident to complete the questionnaire, it just allowed them to include more information about their race background than previously before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's just, you know, we believe that there's a lot of other different reasons why this may be the case, but it just has to be. The way the questionnaire was presented to residents this time around was a lot different than beforehand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so for an African American is of mixed race. And prior to if they were able to just mark on black or African American and now you have another person's identifying with maybe everything else that you may have within your heritage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You may have a few spike in terms of of. Two or more. Racist, right? That's correct. Yeah, that's correct. Which which impacts that that that uses data quite a bit in my opinion. Um, thank you for put American.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think. Councilman, you're Reagan's next. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember. I mean you. Make you a race winner. Really don't have that kind of observation. Obviously, the city of LA, which is changing. We've had a little bit of growth, obviously, but I think we had significant changes in our population shifts in regards to race and ethnicity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One thing I didn't see here in terms of a factor that was obviously very important is the comparison of men and women, where we will see in terms of the population of men and women or LBGTQ youth population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't see that here. Probably was. You probably weren't asked to do that or. I don't know. Was there a question on that in the in the census there? Yeah, there was one of those that's one of the general questions of the ten in the questionnaire, because that data was not included in any of the the graphs'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that we saw here. So we just curious as to what those numbers are and where and where they are actually in the city. Yeah, I think there will be more details into that in the future. Data table releases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when they are, we can certainly communicate that to you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like. Thank you. I'll go next. So, no, I was here in 2010 for the staff report on the last census. And I remember I think Long Beach lost 700 people at that census. 700, 900. It was a more than that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We went up about 800 people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We went up 800.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We just it was less than a thousand was almost nothing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We had a small and then this time, you know, 6000 people went up more. Do we have any idea what what attributed to that growth? I know we were stumped before on how did we stay virtually the same size city over a decade.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any thoughts on was it growth with housing? Any any consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would suggest that the growth in the number of new housing that the city has built over the last decade would certainly have been a contributor. It's hard to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Act, and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that it's also somehow correlated to the number of jobs. And I think if we can look at the growth in some of our major industries, that could likely be another factor. The only other point I would make is that we think that there's probably more growth, because what we're hearing from some of the national studies'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is that there was a significant undercount in the system. So I suspect that our numbers are bigger, but there's no way to validate that or to tell what those numbers are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Certainly that's okay. And there'll be other there'll be other counts that that happen. I think we first of all, Mr. Jackson, you did a great job through the census. We know that you faced significant challenges. There was problems with I remember we lot when I went in on behalf of the city to the registrar's downtown, all that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'meant to kick off the countywide census. And it was that day that like, I think we did like a health order or something requiring masks and no one had masks. So there were significant challenges this time, and I think we all anticipated there would be problems on some significant issues, and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we also knew that 2020 was a very nationally politicized year and the administration significantly politicized the census. And that's something that communities tried to overcome. But we would be unwise to assume there wasn't some level of impact to people's confidence in that process, and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think what it tells me generally and we're going to obviously I would love to see more data in terms of like what Mr. Tatum was talking about is what are the things that we're doing on a local level that impact growth and how we preparing for growth?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're not going in a haphazard way, but really thinking about people's ability to live and thrive and have housing and access to open space and those things where we're growing. What attributes to that? That's, I think, an important insight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think as our population shifts, we need to make sure that we understand the needs of our growing Latino population and what it contributing to the factors of populations that are that may be shrinking. I think Councilman Austin also raised a good point about like my daughters are biracial, they're they're African-American, they're also Latina.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when they grow up, what box do they check? I don't know. And so who knows what the census will look like in the future. But I think we just need to better understand that through data and crossing with, you know, American survey and and other things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I certainly I want to thank you, Kevin, for four for your efforts in leading this the census this time summer. I think it was in time last time. Right. Good work, both of you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, America. And city council members. My name is Becnel. I'm Southern California, Edison's government relations manager for the city of Long Beach. Part of my major responsibilities. And that role is to be the liaison between the company and elected officials like yourselves in your offices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I work closely with a lot of your staff to help resolve constituent issues and whatnot, but I wanted to also let you know that please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly if you should ever have any questions regarding our policy priorities or or operational issues and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Uh, as George mentioned, as he is committed to the community. Using shareholder funds from our parent company, Edison International. We. Support local nonprofits across our service territory, both big and small, in Long Beach. I'm particularly proud of our community giving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In 2022, we provided over $900,000 in philanthropic support to a variety of Long Beach serving organizations, such as the Aquarium of the Pacific Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach and many others. Digital equity. Enhancing digital equity. Just recently, we provided $150,000 in grants to be divided among a handful of Long Beach organizations to support and enhance'",
        "'speaker_1': 'digital equity, such as Centara Shore and Long Beach Math Collaborative, among others. And. Just to put in a plug on a current opportunity that we have is our Edison Scholars program. Each year, Edison gives 30 $40,000 scholarships to high school seniors across our service territory who want to study STEM in college.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've reached out to many of your offices to help promote that program. The application period is still open and is open through December 13th. If the public should be interested in applying, they simply need to go to Edison Scholars dot com for that application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Hi. Good evening. My name is Brian Bustamante. I'm the senior adviser supporting the city of Long Beach. I help support a lot of the business operational needs on the day to day basis. So in terms of strengthening our electric grid and creating a clean energy future, I'd like to touch on improving reliability and really focus on'",
        "'speaker_1': ', you know, how we're transitioning into this sustainable future so as to not only track reliability each year, but we produce a publicly available report to every city tribe within our service territory, including the city of Long Beach. Estes reliability and Long Beach specifically continues to not only be good overall, but also have some of the best reliability'",
        "'speaker_1': 'within our company. It continues to be a focus for us. In terms of investing in our infrastructure, we're continually investing millions of dollars into projects and upgrades in Long Beach to continue to improve this reliability. These projects include grid modernization across the city, extensive system and improvements in the underground network around downtown, a rebuild of our substation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in North Long Beach. And we also recently began work on a battery storage project on the East Long Beach substation. As part of it and in relation to time of use in managing our GHG related emissions as part of a statewide initiative to use more renewable power, our customers will be gradually transitioned over to a time of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'use base rate plan. These plans encourage customers to use energy at the times of day when renewable energy like solar and wind is most abundant and at the lowest cost. Sustainability. Energy efficiency will continue to be an item that supports the citizen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are currently actually working through supporting our terminals at the Port of Long Beach monetarily through an energy efficiency rebate to implement high mast led lighting. Finally electrification. As we continue down this clean energy path with the city, we also we will also continue to look for opportunities to partner with the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The couple electrification to drive down these greenhouse gas related emissions. The C e charger 82 and charged transport programs are good examples of this. And George touched on earlier how the city has participated in these programs. It will continue to be a focus for us to support the infrastructure upgrades around the city as necessary and also including'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the port, the work at the port as well. I'll turn it over to George to close us out. Thank you. In conclusion, I'd like in conclusion, I'd like to re-emphasize that he has selected Long Beach to develop this partnership as a potential model for other cities in the future, which means I anticipate many emails from other'",
        "'speaker_1': 'cities in the future asking us about how this program went and being an expert in the field. And also, I'd like to give a thank you to all the departments who have been involved in the partnership as well, which include City Managers, Office, Public Works, Harbor Development Services, Economic Development, Financial Management, Energy Resources and water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's really been a team effort. So thank you again, Mayor and council members, for having us here today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you so much for that presentation. I just have a few thoughts. So first, I'm happy to support the Clean Pathway Community Partnership. I remember the genesis of the context of the conversation on the CCI. Prior to that, I also remember the City Council having, you know, very stern conversations with Southern California Edison about the downtown outage'",
        "'speaker_5': ', the major downtown outage and the need to invest in infrastructure here locally, have more local discussions about what the condition our infrastructure, the resilience of that of that infrastructure looks like. I also know that we're at the precipice of a major transition in our ports, and we have to make sure that our city is a part of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that. Just one clean zero emission electric truck could be a megawatt of power and that this will require significant investments into charging and enhancements to the grid. I'm particularly interested in this. I think the federal infrastructure bill will make investments toward that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The ports are looking toward the future. We have to make sure those investments help create living wage jobs as well as the major transitions. I think that's something that's important. I like Mr. Lopez that you mentioned the electric vehicle charging infrastructure for commuters in our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's a big opportunity, too. But we have to make sure that we're really looking at it with an equity lens. Areas that are a lot of times right adjacent to the freeways already, Bill, and breathe poor air and they oftentimes they're not in a place where there's infrastructure in place for them to even, you know'",
        "'speaker_5': ', participate in work in an electric vehicle. We participate the programs we offer are sometimes the only thing they have access to in order to have an incentive to buy something or install it at their home or have electric charging in there in their area, in the electric vehicle charging stations that we do have, or a lot of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'times there are 110 right there. You know, you can sit down and eat lunch at Uptown Commons and after an hour, you've only added maybe five miles to your car. Right. So we have to think about where the Superchargers are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you have Superchargers, people will drive and support that business and eat lunch at that place simply to get an hour on a supercharger. So it's an economic development opportunity and that's a supercharger. And so that those are certainly things we should look at.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the last thing I would say is, as we explore this partnership, some of our open space plans are directly related to the availability of Edison Raceway. And in the areas that have the least open space, some of the only opportunities they have are the Edison right away.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Historically, Edison Edison's real estate folks have been very aggressive about monetizing those, prioritizing leasing to anything like a nursery or whatever it is, and have been resistant to open space. But that's some of our last opportunities on the West Side and North Long Beach for open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I hope that as we look at this partnership, we think about reprioritizing the values in particularly in areas that lack open space or partnerships that can be mutually beneficial for the development. Open space cities need time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to note that that parcels available so we can write the grants and do the designs. It could take five years to develop a apart. If you don't have that type of partnership, it's very difficult to do so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So those are the things I would submit to say we should think about as we move forward. So it's really a truly beneficial partnership that advances equity. Councilman Austin. Councilwoman Allen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. Um. I want to just first say it. Thank you, Eric, for your introduction and George for your presentation. You know, it's important and we're going to need to use every tool in the toolbox to reduce emissions and speed up our transition to clean energy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as Southern California Edison's largest customer. We have a significant influence and our partnership with them. We need to find the funding to buy 100% green energy. And we need more residents and local businesses to make the commitment to 100% green energy as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I look forward to the a report coming back in December. I do have some questions with regards to our what outreaches on Southern California Edison doing to prompt residents to switch to the green rate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in the partnership, we've actually been working collaboratively, collaboratively with Etsy to promote the green rate. So what we've done is we've tried to be more more mindful of of using our own social media accounts. What we've done is we recently we actually worked with ASEAN to develop that social media campaign.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They pushed it out on their channels, and their channels reach more of a regional level. We then collaborated with them to use our own channels to then post that information to our residents. We also collaborated with them to leverage their next door account to focus green rate program messaging, specifically in the Long Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we also have ideas, especially with the funding available now in FY 22 for maybe 32 to work more collaboratively, collaboratively on possibly more multimedia type efforts to promote the program within the city as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. And then my next question is, how much progress has Southern California Edison made on the charge ready 2.0 program implementation? Because I know, like our high rise is low income family buildings older than 20 years old weren't built with wiring for EV charging.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I know it's been slow, but it's going to be key for expanding to zero emission vehicles, especially to our renters and condo owners.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the program just opened up in July. And we're our goal is to get 38,000 charging stations out within the service territory over the next five years. That being said, we, the city of Long Beach has the most applications out of any other city within our service territory by far.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think it's a symptom of the collaboration and the fact that we're looking at everything possible. We are completely open to exploring additional sites. It's just. At this point. There's about 29 applications in even just since July.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's moving very quickly. So if you have any recommendations, will gladly take those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. Thank you. And also, I have another quick question for you. Has Southern California Edison invested in any might microgrid projects locally here in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So where there has been some conversations about a looking at a microgrid in the the port area that's still a work in progress in terms of doing a specific microgrid here a lot of those projects at this time are customer driven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, we are looking at opportunities to maybe couple some of those technologies, which is what I, I touched on a little bit in terms of the battery storage projects at some of our substations. So we're exploring it, but it's kind of a new piece for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then also has with regards to your Southern California Edison's fleet. Is there a timeline or what's the plan for that going 100% emission. Their omission. Are you are your is your fleet currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So like our fleet of. Okay. So at this time, we do have a plan to do that. However, we're not currently retrofitting our approach from a utility standpoint as it's hard because these are big, heavy duty vehicles. We're not taking the approach to retrofit them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want something that's sort of built for our industry. So it's definitely something that's on the horizon for us. But we're we're trying to get the market to catch up with what we need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then one last question. Are there any, like, simple, straightforward opportunities for local property owners to invest in solar, solar cooperatives? I'm sorry and sell it back. Are there any opportunities for business owners or or property owners to invest and sell solar and then sell it back?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have solar rates. The rates the goal really isn't so they can sell it back. It's really to be net neutral within the our tariffs, but there are opportunities for compensation back, but it's not necessarily a retail rate back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilman Sabrina.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And thank you, folks for the presentation tonight. Great job. I want to speak off topic here for a little bit so much the work the council offices that they micro-level a street later a small power outage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as long as it is here tonight, I wanted to commend Vic North for just providing a superior level of customer service to our office. I think you've been here less than a year, but it's been quite noticeable and we will feature the Edison Scholarship in this Friday's newsletter and continue to do so through December.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I also want to commend your office on the additional support my team has built, better supported, and we appreciate that. There's nothing harder for a family that either has an infant or a senior citizen than when a family member doesn't have power.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so those updates on your website and the regularity of which they can be updated and the ability to reach out to Vik or whomever from my team is really critical. I will say, though, that this year we had the least number of power outages in a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that has a lot to do with a lot of the VoLTE upgrades that you've done. However, as the city embarks upon what I know Erik is so excited about, which will be a record breaking infrastructure decade, we really need support in staffing up your ranks to be able to support the planned changes and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'checks that are necessary to implement the EV charging stations, the VoLTE upgrades, all of those things. And I know you're struggling to get people just like the city is qualified. People are very hard to come by. But there has to be a solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise, these major infrastructure projects across our city won't be able to move forward because we as a city have made a commitment that if we're going to have a street, we want to give you that opportunity in advance to fix all the things that are underneath that street before we pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that we've had some challenges with Volt locating and fixing and those timelines. And I know that they're they're not unusual challenges, but we do need to plan. The region will be getting significant federal funding. We're looking at some bond options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we need you to be prepared to support us on that because the residents can't move forward and we're going to have some strict timelines. So I want to thank you for the work today and know that more needs to be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I appreciate the the movement towards green energy, but I also want to speak on behalf of our senior citizens. Our senior citizens are experiencing 40% increases in grocery costs and gasoline cost 15% increases in some grocery needs and necessities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And energy is a place where they just can't take anymore increases. And so I would love to see an option that allows people opting in to the Green Plan, which I think is a great idea, but pacing ourselves and recognizing that our senior citizens are on a fixed income and their Social Security is not increasing at the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'same rate as inflation is. And so we need to really think about the ways in which you have supported our low income communities very, very effectively. And communities that are not typically considered low income are going to be experiencing some some pinching of their their pocketbook as all these costs have increased and their income has not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that I've talked to a lot of seniors recently that are trying to figure out how that $800 a month or 1200 dollars a month that they live on can stretch further than it's ever had to stretch before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know you're a big part of that, and I appreciate your partnership. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Zendejas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think you raised me. I just wanted to thank you, Eric, George, Vic, all of you guys, for the presentation and for your continuous partnership and willing to work with us and for your excellent customer service. I know I've email you in panic that late at night and you and your team have really come through and really helped'",
        "'speaker_2': 'out my residents in times of need. And I just wanted to publicly thank you for for that. And I look forward to the continuing building of our partnership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fantastic. Thank you. And as we conclude and go to public comment, I just want to echo and say, Vic, you're doing an incredible job. We love your service. And Larry and Kiana have been very thoughtful and responsive, not just here, but across the region as very public comment on this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we have to. Dave Shukla and Tiffanie Davey, come forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, we know who the public comment is. We can just come on at this point. That's good. Come on. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What am I doing here? Um. I couldn't help but laugh a couple of times during this presentation. Southern California Edison is one of the primary reasons why the state of California can't yet meet its climate goals. You have been holding the entire fucking state back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'AB 1139 this year. Do you have any idea how much of my time wasted and for what? To take away the net metering, the battery storage and the solar panels that my neighbors have had for ten years. You asked Councilwoman Allen if there's a possibility of an electricity co-op that could get money back if they're producing an'",
        "'speaker_1': 'overage with their solar panels. Every car in the state has a program like that. The only people who don't want you to have net metering so that you can know how much you're sending back to their grid. Are these folks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've been seeing it for ten years. I've also been a rate payer of Southern California Edison for the past 24 years. So for the entirety of my adult life, I've been watching this city make the wrong decisions since the O'Neill administration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city of Long Beach could have created something like L.A. DWP back in the nineties. We didn't. And that's why the port had to bail us out of the recession in the nineties. The building that we're sitting in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was paid for by the port. As a result of those decisions. We know from the M.W. analysis that if we had implemented a CPA, it would already be making money for the city today. By the end of the decade, we're talking about a couple hundred million dollars per year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A way to optimize across all the oil abandonment costs when they say they want to gradually work people in to the green rate or whatever it's called. What they're trying to do is figure out how to hold on to really bad contracts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Case in point horrible project the city is responsible for. I grew up across the street from the East Point and Studebaker. Project shouldn't have been rebuilt and you shouldn't have slapped 600 megawatts up to 300 megawatts right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. A battery storage across the street from my mother's bedroom. We, the fire department, doesn't even have that much baking soda for an electrical fire. Um, but more importantly, it's because of contracts like that that have grown there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Delta has been basically making chumps out of you, and the innovations in the electricity markets have been one of the most fascinating things where you feel a graduate student study. If I didn't have to come home and help out here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The key discussion needs to come back. This is a fucking slap in the face.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'll make my comment rather brief. Timothy Davie, District President Speaking in opposition of this item for a number of reasons, but I only highlight one, which is accountability. But I'm going to walk back to one of the items we discussed earlier this evening about mental health, and we've been very concerned with the pandemic since the beginning'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the pandemic. In my partnership in assisting landlords and renters in the city, one way, perhaps, we could have been supported. But many other utilities did actually had a header, something close to our humanity about the impacts. As I was helping residents receiving bills upwards of 20 $500 past due.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Disconnection. Disconnection. Disconnection. They're already stressed. But let's focus back. Let's go back to 2015. Those 30,000 customers that were affected, the cpu c0i results were what, 15 million? We supported SB 174 to have 4 million allocated back to the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Granted, there were many items addressed so that we did not incur those same damages again. Insert 2021. Continued explosions underground. And then let's just go to the last weekend or exactly one week from when we passed today, where the same security and enforcement division issued an MCO in the amount of $550 million for his wrong and lack'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of. Accountability in the right. Myers in liberty, Thomas and Woolsey fires. Just want to go over that damage. That was 385,000 acres damage and destroy nearly 3000 structures and five fatalities. 550,000,375 million of which they can not step away from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So who pays for the future cost incurred in future disasters? We can almost assuredly be assured will occur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, members. Please cast your vote.'"
