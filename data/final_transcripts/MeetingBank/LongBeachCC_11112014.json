And we've done quite a bit in our parking management in the downtown and certainly the public parking lots have done quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The debate has done quite a bit. Do we get to see how we can improve our operations? It's certainly a good time to look at it. We see a lot more activity, especially along Pine Avenue, with the different restaurants that have come in in the last 8 to 12 months.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And I did some of my own research and that was my understanding as well. So some of our neighboring cities that would be geographically similar don't have plays on all city projects. For example, the City of L.A. doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'City of San Diego doesn't. So I'm wondering and we had asked specifically for what the threshold limits would be in some of the other cities so that we can do that comparison. And the staff report of November six indicates the minimum dollar amount for a play of 1 million or more is designed to have a suitable number'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of projects over the next two years, about 10 to 15 projects, even though it is lower than the typical amount in other cities and much lower than the federal policy recommendation of 25 million that the city was previously using.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can you elaborate a little bit more about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We we looked at when we got this request from City Council I, we took it as our goal to review whether we could support a play limit that was less than 25 million. And we thought that we could if it represents that $1 million, it represents about 47 projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if it were $500,000, it would represent 71 projects. And so although that may not match exactly with what other cities have done, it's not that far off from what was done. And we think we can manage a program at either 1 million or $500,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The proposal by.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so would staff's recommendation still be to have that threshold at $1,000,000?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'In looking at the item. I wanted to maybe perhaps the makers of the motion can elaborate a little bit on this. And I have tried to research it a little bit, but. I have a problem with the language of and it's on page one of four.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The participants cannot provide the employers a sufficient number of local residents from within the city of Long Beach. First tier zip codes. Does that mean that only certain ZIP codes would be considered in terms of the first line of possible employers employees?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because if so, I would have a real issue with that. I think that the I think that I agree with Councilmember O'Donnell in terms of the benefits of a project labor agreement and having a local hire component and having an apprenticeship program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I don't believe we should discriminate by zip code. I think All Long Beach residents should have the opportunity to apply for the jobs and to be part of the Apprentice program. And I know that there are many people in my district who could use that work and would want should have the opportunity to be considered.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So are we discriminating by zip codes here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, let me actually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember O'Donnell, did you want to respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can be quick on that. The answer is no, because you'll see a list of zip codes that have been that have been provided in the other zip codes. They are all long beach zip codes, although Long Beach zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it isn't a this isn't a situation where we're going to say, hey, we're going to grab from three zip codes only and then move on to other zip codes in another tier. All Long Beach zip codes are in first here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do we have a list of the zip codes?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know if it's. Well, even if we don't. The intent this evening is that it be all Long Beach zip code. So I think if we express that, I think the team over there will pick up on that and move ahead with all long language zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Price And to clarify what I think what you're referring to is there was some there was some thought out there among some that we should that we should start with just a few Long Beach zip codes, then move, move out from there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the proposal, as put forward this evening, applies to all Long Beach zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, well, I think while we might need to amend the item then, because if you look through the item, it talks about first tiered zip codes and there's no definition in the item of a first tier zip code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've been handed a document here and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me define it for you right now. All Long Beach zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Well, then we should take out the terms first tier zip codes. And then the second thing is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, hold on, hold on, because first it's Long Beach, then it's regional. Because if we get it first here being Long Beach, second tier being outside, as I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Understand, I get what you're saying and perhaps the perhaps the city attorney can opine on this. But if you read the sentence, it says, then if the participants cannot provide the employers a sufficient number of local residents from within the city of Long Beach parentheses first tier zip codes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The participants will extend their best efforts to recruit and identify referral local residents residing within a 15 mile radius from Long Beach City Hall, which implicates or infers that that would be above and beyond the first tier. So if it's all Long Beach residents, then 15 mile radius from Long Beach City Hall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would be the second tier.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. But it says that's right. But when we have first tier zip codes identified in there, it implies that there are other zip codes, for example, that's got a 15 year I mean, 15 mile language. If you go scroll down a little bit on page two, it's got a ten mile radius, which is a different hiring requirement'",
        "'speaker_7': '. If you look at the ten mile radius from Long Beach City Hall list, my district is not on here. So, you know, there are definitely provisions and I get what you're saying and I completely support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're in the first tier.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And I hear what you're saying. I think we need to modify that so that first year to include all Long Beach zip codes and that we should eliminate the 15 mile and ten mile.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know that you want to do that. Here's why. Because I think one of the efforts here is to avoid contractors bringing in out-of-state workers, because that is a situation which we've and I think some out there would share when I'm when I'm when I'm what I'm saying right now is that is a situation we're trying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to avoid, because what they will do is they will bring out-of-state workers for a large project, put them up in hotels. They may not even pay them the required wage. And oftentimes there's no way to seek redress when they move back to that state from which they came.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think you're pointing out, Miss Price, I think you're pointing out that this needs to be clarified. I think as this goes through the process, this is not done this evening. You make some great points and I'm not going to fault you for them at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the city attorney and he could even share right now that he could get some of those things clarified as we move through the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Parker, can you can you help me? Can you walk us through those questions that Councilwoman Price said, if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could help clarify?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mayor Morris Council Councilmember Price I think you're absolutely right. I didn't anticipate tonight we would be negotiating the agreement, but it would be my understanding that the these would be defined by exhibits. And then if the first tier, which I understood, would be all zip codes of the city of Long Beach, then we could correct the language'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on the radius to do a radius from the city's boundary to incorporate the general corporate area for the second tier. And then, as they described the third tier, it would be any and all of Los Angeles and Orange County.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we would anticipate that if we get to the point where we're directed to a negotiated agreement, we would come up with exhibits that would further define this document and bring that back to council for their consideration and approval.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So tonight, we wouldn't be into the terms specific, but we would certainly have to clarify that. So everyone knows on a go forward basis what each one of those tiers are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's good. And I appreciate that. And I hope that when we watch the video, again, the intent is very clear in terms of what what residents we want included in this. The question the next question I have for staff is, do you have any and I know that the document says no fiscal impact, the agenda item'",
        "'speaker_7': 'says no fiscal impact. Do you really believe that this will have no fiscal impact on the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we commented on in our memo is that there will be some administrative cost. One to do the negotiations will be in using some consultants to assist us and also to assist us in monitoring whether what we use for for the monitoring is somewhat specified by the the High Council item, but there would be some costs associated'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with that and there are some costs there may or may not be costs depending on whether there is any impact, as some would claim, on on on the number of bids and the price of the bids. But there are no statistics available on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we do think there would be a fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. In looking at the agenda item, page two of four, and I and I believe Councilwoman Gonzales has touched upon it, the request that this agreement includes some project labor coordinator. What has the staff contemplated in regards to that requirement?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Who would pay for that position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was that issue we would be looking at? We don't have an answer on that today. We certainly see what the direction is. And I think depending on what direction council gives us, that would be what we would look at as to how we could how we could achieve all that council directs us and how much we think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it would cost in administrative costs, how we can save as much money as possible on that. Well, we don't know the answer specifically.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there could be a fiscal impact in terms of having to hire someone to do that, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There will be in one form or another, either contractually or by hiring.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. My recommendation, I would make an amendment at this time to take the project labor coordinator aspect of this agreement out of the equation until staff has had an opportunity to evaluate what that cost would be and whether that's a component that we could actually afford, given our budget, if that cost is going to be something that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'would be put on the contractor, for example, I think that the council needs to have the opportunity to determine what, if any, impact that would have on the contractors in terms of whether it would deter them from applying for contracts in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think that's an additional component that we don't have any information about. And there was no attachment to the agenda item about what this person would get paid, what their hours would be. Who would. For them. None of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just I'm it's purely speculative. So I would ask for a friendly amendment that we take the project labor coordinator component out of the equation at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that that's not a substitute motion, but a friendly amendment to the maker of the motion. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. So let's at first ask the the maker of the motion if she accepts that friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. At this time, I want to be very clear that this is a study. So we can certainly look at those. And I think that's what we're asking for in the next 30 days. So, no, I won't accept that friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the recommendation isn't really and it may be a study, but it's directing the city manager to negotiate a citywide project. Labor agreement with the components identified in this doesn't appear to be a study in terms of the language.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will check with the city attorney on that. Mr. City attorney, would you agree with that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I agree with your interpretation that the direction of the language here would be to start the negotiations with the Los Angeles and Orange County Building, Trades Building and Construction Trades Council, and then report back the progress on those negotiations within 30 days to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, I'm still not going to accept the friendly amendment. I misspoke in saying it's a study, but I do believe that we still need to incorporate the project coordinator in that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to clarify, also, there is there's a motion on the floor. I just want to make sure that that motion, Councilman Gonzales, does include the elimination of that $25,000 cap as well. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's all it's $500,000 is a number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For all projects. The threshold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Going, Councilman Price, are you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you complete.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are each of my questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think I have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any other questions at this time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So just a few things. So, I mean, I support this. I think this is a great thing for the for I'm happy that our colleagues have brought this forward. And I'm happy that Councilmember O'Donnell's really been in leadership for so much time on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the right thing to do. It's proven, it transforms lives. And so what I'd like to I just have a few questions and some clarity. So I heard in the motion it said Gas department and Water Department would, do we have the authority does this body have the authority to to adopt an agreement that covers those areas'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or with their respective bodies? Need to adopt it as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As to the gas department is. Yes. As to the harbor and water department. No, this body would not have the jurisdiction. They would have to take an independent action by their boards to adopt a re project labor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the first thing I would do is ask the maker of the motion to include some specific language to go to the water department and to request that they similarly adopt this this item. You agree to that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Second question. So so I know there's been a lot of discussion about local hire and local hire. And I know there was a memo out earlier about work source and some of the work that's taking place there is the city manager maybe next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you can one of you chime in on some of the work you guys are doing with work source to ensure that we're hiring folks locally and from disadvantaged communities?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. West I'm going to turn to I'm gonna turn this over to Nick Schultz in just a moment. But tonight, we're being asked to do a play. We talked about the possibility of a first class hiring that Nick is working on, but that's not what we're being asked to do tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But with that, I'm going to turn it over to Nick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just to clarify, the reason I'm asking is because obviously there's an expectation we're talking about local hire. There is a nexus between the issues. I want to see if the mechanisms are in this agreement or if the mechanisms are out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be outside of this agreement to ensure that we can do that. That's why I just want to make that connection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so the mechanisms that you're discussing tonight are not for a broader city hire that would that would actually allow the city's investments in service contracts and non construction projects to have a first source and a local hiring component.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Web is working to craft a recommendation that we hope will be brought forward at a later time for the council to consider in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so that said, just a quick question. Are the are the so the zip codes discussion, are those like best practices or those actual requirements as a part of this policy with what would those be considered?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sorry, Councilmember. The zip codes would be part of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Target zip codes like hiring folks. This is this like a requirement on this agreement?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Generally speaking, in a project labor agreement, the answer would be yes. The. You would set up a waterfall for the hiring. And the way I understand the direction this evening would be, the first tier would be all zip codes that encompass the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then you fall to subsequent tiers of a of a greater area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I wanted to get some clarity on that. No, there's been diverging discussion about whether this requires us to hire our folks locally or whether it would or not. So I'm glad to hear that is a requirement that we will hire our folks first.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a best efforts on the part of the union to find folks that are qualified within the zip codes. And if they can't do that to meet their numbers, then we expand the boundaries. So their first look is at the zip codes within Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if that's not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Available, that's correct. If they don't have the qualify the qualifications to meet the requirement, they can go to the next tier, which would be a radius around the city and then to the Orange County, Los Angeles County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great. Great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to go back to the clarifying question that Councilmember Price asked regarding the contract compliance officer. And while it could pose a cost to the city, I know that we've seen cities incorporate that as part of an existing staff members, job duties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Mr. City Manager, I'm wondering how you would envision that. I don't believe that it necessarily has to be an additional position. Is this is this something that one of the staff members is already working on projects and development projects, someone that's working on any is in any any one of those positions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could they fulfill this role without adding a cost to the city?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or. Mr. GROSS.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'John? John GROSS. Okay. John GROSS. We looked at that and again, this we haven't had a lot of time to review this, but our our guess is that that, no, we would have to use an external person. That is typically what we have done with plays.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Regardless, we did not have the internal staff resources to handle it when we did the airport. So it would be normal and expected, I think, to to at least use outside contract. It would not be done internally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in your experience, have there been projects not necessarily in the city of Long Beach, but other other municipalities that may have plays? Where the cost of that is is part of the development costs, but it's not a direct cost to the city that is part is paid for by the third party, but not managed by the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'third party.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the only one I saw was Berkeley. And in I'm not saying there weren't others. I'm just saying that the only one I saw was Berkeley. And their cost recovery efforts in a recent memo did not work. So we we absorbed the costs through the project with the airport.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what. And charged it to the project. That's what we anticipate doing this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening. First, I want to start out by saying that I am in support of apprenticeship programs. I am in support of training programs. I am in support of local hire. When we talk about compliance, compliance is the only component of ensuring that some of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Contracts are in compliance. Sometimes we are partners, agree to things, and without a compliance component, there is no enforcement of that agreement. And when I've sat down and met with some of the unions that are actually here today, we talked about some of the agreements with non play contractors and how they make promises and then without a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'compliance component there is no enforceability. So I am strongly in favor of compliance. I think we need to discuss specifically the components of compliance that are necessary. In my prior role in $180 million annual budget, we used to contract out approximately a million a year and we had a team of compliance staff that would audit different components'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of a workforce in different components of a hiring process and different components, especially with our million dollars for veterans, that all of those things are there. So compliance is important to me. With that said, I would like to find a way through negotiations that, as stated in the original items intent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe that that would not be a new and burdensome cost on the city. And so I have some concerns in alignment with the discussions we had at Budget Oversight Committee a few weeks ago. That fiscal impact needs to be discussed by project, and I feel that many of the partners in the room today feel that there's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'no fiscal impact. And so I would hope that they would be supportive of the idea of an annual review of the additional costs, some of which. We as a body would want to decide are important. I think it's more important to say there are additional costs and identify them than to say, well, we're going to reallocate costs'",
        "'speaker_10': 'inside house. That's still not an appropriate fiscal terminology. If staff are allocated to work on something, then they are costing the city money and they are costing the taxpayers money. And I think we just need to be open and honest about what our values are and what that means.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Additionally, under no circumstances will I ever vote yes on an item that has unlimited, no actionable extensions. No matter what contract we have, whether it's a contractor that we have loved our whole lives that may have built the foundation of America, we have to have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Even through potentially a consent item on the agenda, the option to discuss performance regularly. And I hope that our partners would be open to discussing the value that they bring on an annual basis, or at least at the end of the first term.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But to have unlimited non discussion extensions seems absolutely unreasonable to me. So with that fiscal impact compliance, um, in terms of and direction of, I'd like to make a substitute motion and pulling open the item. Sorry, I'm trying to go paperless.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I would like to bring forth a substitute motion that states that an annual fiscal impact will be provided to the Council through a consent item so that it is provided ten days in advance to the Council. We can discuss the fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We can state that this is one of our priorities, and we would like to put a staff member plus employee benefits on compliance. I think that all of you value compliance as a major component of this. I would also state that extensions would be through consent calendar of the council in the same way that we would want'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to approve any other way that we do anything. And so let me try to say what my substitute motion is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually, councilwoman. I can take that as a friendly amendment versus a substitute motion. I think that would be more appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So what are we saying exactly?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why don't we have let's have Councilwoman Mongeau read exactly what she's trying to achieve and then Councilwoman Gonzales, whether or not you accept that or not and whether it's a substitute.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And my only concern on my substitute is that we're kind of pushing Charlie to negotiate for us, and we're Charlie and Pat or whoever that works on terms that we're putting out in the public. And that's not really a negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's like playing poker, but all our cards are forward and on the table and in front of us. And so a component of this that I'd like to discuss is how potentially the other partners would pay for the compliance option.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that negotiating the terms and then coming back to council with either a study or I don't know, I don't know the wording to get us to a discussion of what those costs are. Because I think sending someone away with we agree that we want to talk about the costs and go ahead and approve it'",
        "'speaker_10': 'before we know what they are. Maybe even a memo back or I don't know. Help me out here, team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do you want?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't want to approve an item that I don't know the fiscal impacts that we're not being open and honest about someone's value. I think both the partners here would state that their value is diminished if we say that it has no fiscal impact.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Instead, the Council should have the courage to say this will cost us $200,000 a year because it'll cost us 1.5 staff members. And with that we would want to move forward. But I think we should know what the number is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what do you want?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilman, it is in motion. So let me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not clear on what I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mean. I try to be funny. I mean, what kind of motion?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In fairness, we've only had since Friday at 4:00. So look at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me let me let me ask question. I haven't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Had a time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To. So I think I think what at least one of the things that Councilman Mango's looking for is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilwoman. You're looking for an annual review that would come from staff, that would come that was coming to you, that would speak to what the costs were for that year and the progress of those projects within the within the scope of the project labor agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, yes. Okay. So that is I believe that Councilwoman Gonzalez earlier mentioned that she would accept that as a as a friendly amendment. Is that correct? That is that's that's part one.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so it's a one year contract with annual consent items on the agenda with that item to continue. So you'd have to put it on in advance. So maybe 90 days or 100 days before the end of the term, it would say prior year cost us $125,000.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What a great investment in our community. And it would be on the consent item to go forward for another year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that is that's different. So the. So part one of what Councilman Mongo asked for was this annual review. The second part, from the way I understand it, is you would ask that on a yearly basis that items would come forward, but the Council would have to affirm vote in the affirmative through consent on those items'",
        "'speaker_0': 'coming forward for that year. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That sounds reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I just want to make sure so that that's certainly different than the first part. So, Councilwoman Gonzalez, so either are you making that a substitute or are you asking Councilman Gonzalez as a friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was originally going with the substitute because I didn't see her except the first from the amendment, but I would look that direction to see where we're headed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can take it as a friendly amendment. That's okay. Fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So so I understand you're taking both as a friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But both items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On let floor once again, council becomes a roadblock. Okay, so let me so what we have I just want to be very clear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please be very clear. Let me be very clear. Getting lost in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This, from what I understand and someone correct me if I'm wrong, there are two things that Councilwoman Mango's looking for. The first is she's asking for an annual review from staff on the status of the project labor agreement that would come to the council once a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with the status update of the projects that I believe Councilman Gonzalez you've okayed. Correct. Okay. The second thing, and maybe I'm less clear here, the second thing that Councilman Mango's asking for is a annual vote. That would be an affirmative vote of a council that would be essentially on consent calendar, that would list the projects that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would come before that would have to affirmatively move forward. They get that point. Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that the issue is it says there's a five year contract with unlimited extensions with no action. I think that's a concern. I think that if you have a anyone who works for you, whether it's the person that I don't have a garden, cleans my pool every year, I discuss with them the annual rate hike that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'comes in because challenges change and things change. So there needs to be a term of the contract and then. Extensions need to be approved by a body. We don't have unlimited non-voting extensions. So I'd like to reduce the term from five years to three years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think one year is too short, five years to three years. And then I think extensions shouldn't be annual. They should be in maybe three year blocks even. We should talk about a lot of these projects are long term and so annual one year non-voting amend.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That sounds crazy to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's that's definitely a very different, different proposal. And so I don't know if there's that a substitute. Councilman Mango.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was first looking to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'See Councilman Gonzalez. Do you accept that friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. I'd like to make a substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so that's a up. So we have a substitute motion, and I'm going to have a count the before time, the vote. We're going to go through the motions so we everyone knows exactly what they're voting for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember O'Donnell. Than Councilmember Durango, then. Is that welcome?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just to be clear, we have the original motion which approves this item. And you actually said that you agreed to a friendly amendment right here. The friendly amendment said on an annual basis, the costs incurred by this agreement will be shared.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your document to the council amendment to the council. But you're not agreeing to the the the the annual.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And write the annual.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Complaint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Required agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Agreement. And I just want to make sure that that motion get a second. I thought I heard something over here but was there a second on that motion? There was not a Second Amendment on the substitute. Okay, hold on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was a substitute motion made by Councilman Mongo. Is there a second on the substitute?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Can I clarify my substitute? Cause I'm not sure that it's clear. Please. Okay, so my substitute encompasses what was in the friendly amendment, plus more. So item number one of the substitute motion will be that an annual report is brought forward to the council that shows the value and costs of the project labor agreement for the year'",
        "'speaker_10': '. Item number two is that before we sign on the dotted line, the Council will know what the annual costs of a compliance officer are. Right now this council is approving an item that we don't know the costs of, and we should know the cost of things that we approve and the source of funds because we passed a'",
        "'speaker_10': 'balanced budget. And what I hear us asking to do right now is to either which I have not heard, reallocate internal resources that were supposedly at limits or create new costs without a source of funds, which I would not be in agreement with.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And item number three is that it would be a three year contract with three year extensions as approved by the council. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second I have I have a speakers list. I'm going to go down. The speakers have got four or five council members. So, Councilmember O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just do you have to share that your your motion somewhat changed there as we went through this this conversation significantly changed as far as the annual reporting. You know, I'm supportive of that. But the other component, I'm not supportive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the reasons why is because it takes an apprentice generally four years to get through their apprenticeship program. So you're not going to see the benefits. You're one necessarily to the participants, your local economy, etc.. So that that that's why I have the opinion as such.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll turn it back to you, Mr. Cake.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Vice Mayor Lowenthal, than Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wanted to contact person. If I wanted to follow up with Councilmember Mungo's request on those three items and I'm just that different, can I ask you a question? Council member Mongo. Yeah. Sorry, sorry. I can't. I can't see you from here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We think Councilmember O'Donnell brought up a good point. So these are things that we need to discuss because we need to discuss them in public. Thank you. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I do think we can work within the construct of adding a friendly amendment or requesting a friendly amendment to the authors. Two out of the three items you requested are amenable to the authors and certainly are amenable to me in the five year to three year component.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember O'Donnell shared the challenge with our apprentices and internships. I think it's very reasonable to go back to your first iteration of that third component, which is after a five year contract, year after year, come back to the Council on a consent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're absolutely right. We don't do that. That is not the culture of how we do contracts in the city is to have sort of this limitless, boundless extensions. And so doing that is reasonable. And and I'd ask that you consider reverting back to a friendly amendment with with those two your 2/1 items and leaving the five year'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the third item as a five. With the one year coming back on consent. So the council has an opportunity to review it and review the performance. I think what you're what you're trying to get at is something that we all support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, I wholeheartedly feel and I'm confident that we all behind this day to support this, which is that performance matters. And certainly our partners in the trades want that. They want to demonstrate that they have performed well under this this contract or soon to be contract or agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it's it's beneficial to both sides. I do believe we're there and we can be there with a friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I, I like the friendly amendment for five years. I think Councilmember O'Donnell makes an excellent point. And I think that the Roberts or the Brown Act would not have allowed us to discuss that in advance. So I appreciate your insights and guidance on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just so I'm clear, is there, Councilman Mongo, you have a substitute motion as as amended by the friendly amendment from Vice Mayor Lowenthal, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Okay. Because you I was hoping that I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. I was hoping that Councilmember, the Councilmember Mongo and Councilmember Price would withdraw their substitute and allow Councilmember Gonzalez to work that into her original motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, does Councilwoman Gonzalez accept that as part of the original motion as a friendly amendment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I accept.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is that I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Accept I'm accepting the the annual review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The compliance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the compliance after the fight and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The cost of the compliance officers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The council?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I will comply. Let me. Let me. 1/2 here. I want to be very clear. What we're doing is it's getting very complex.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's okay. That's okay. So I just want to make sure very clear, Councilman Gonzales, what we have right now in front of us is council. Councilmember Mongo is asking for from friendly amendments, two of which you have accepted prior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One friendly amendment is at correct me if I'm wrong, at the end of the five years it would come back for a review at the after city council. Is that correct, Councilman Mongo? Is that what you asked for?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzalez, do you accept that friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Being the first two, but not the last? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So she does not accept that. So, Councilman Mongo, do you want this to be a substitute? Cause we've got to move this forward. So do you want it to be a substitute or were. What is your substitute exactly?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So she's accepted the first two, not the last one.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if I take such as from the amendment, it's almost identical to the original motion. With the exception of one. We have the annual review of fiscal impact, which still is a five year contract, and then we would review at that time and decide to move forward with an extension which could be one year or three years'",
        "'speaker_10': 'or five years. Currently it just says one. So this could be more beneficial if this shows to be the value that we are saying it could be. It would bring forth the cost of these compliance officers, at least as an estimate, before Charlie negotiates.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we know what we're asking for and hopefully we would be able to share that cost with our partners and. I think that's it. Okay, great. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will tell you that that does sound different to me than than the original motion. So I just want to make sure that we're being very clear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I feel very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over it. Hold on. I think there's two very different I think there's two different motions that are on the floor. There's a substitute by Councilwoman Mongo, and there is your original motion. Councilwoman Gonzalez that's in place. And so I think that there has been a second on a substitute unless Councilman Mango wants to change that substitute, let's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'move the process forward. One of the substitute that fails, we go back to the main.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Motion with accepting. So just friendly amendments to see Councilwoman Gonzalez. Could you tell me what the variance is from the original.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The complaints.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the friendly or maybe.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Suja chicken.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sushi?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let let me so let me let me turn it over to Vice Mayor Lowell.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To be more clear as well in saying that the only thing I'll accept is the annual report. That's right. You know, I think it's being a little bit more convoluted at this point. The annual report. I will accept everything else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It will not accept. It's not clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I think it's very clear. Councilman Gonzales will only accept that the and report back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just so I can I can articulate Councilmember Gonzales did not accept the amendment that I had suggested. What I had hoped was for the original authors to retain ownership of the motion. And I thought that there was more agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. So the reporting is clear. I think the only the only thing that's not being accepted is the final item. Correct, Mr. Mayor, which is the item on the automatic renewals?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct. I think right now we have a we have a the original motion, which is the motion as presented with the review that comes from staff once a year. That's the motion as presented by Councilman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's as far as she will go. And then we have a substitute motion by Councilwoman Mango with that with that additional piece that you just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So now let me go through the queue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, so so, Mayor, let me may I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ask a point of clarification on the substitute motion that's on the floor currently? As I have it in my notes, there is a substantive motion, a second by price, that has the annual fiscal impact report required that the term of the agreement would be a five year term or a proposed five year term, with annual extensions approved'",
        "'speaker_9': 'by the City Council. And three, the cost of the compliance officer would be provided to the City Council before authorization of the agreement. And then also for clarification purposes, does the substitute motion accept the other previous motions as made by the Council members to make a request to the Harbor and Water Department to consider adoption of a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'similar agreement and the removal of the single trade specialty contract that was discussed. So that also includes those two items.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. I do have a speaker's list, so I want to make sure I get to the speaker's list via email with all you had completed your comments with the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Next, we have council member Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'After all of the iterations that we've just gone through, I have to go back with our original document here that provides a very clear direction as to how we want this negotiation to take place, including a the compliance officer and compliance component to it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that all of this can be negotiated during the association process. All we're doing at this point is directing city staff to enter into a negotiation where all of these issues can be addressed, whether it's a compliance officer that is paid through the city, paid through a contractor, maybe both.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know. We can work that out. That's part of the negotiation process. In regards to a three year document or a five year document, my important issue is with the apprenticeship programs. A lot of apprenticeship programs are based on hours worked, not on bodies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have to make sure that whatever we negotiate is that we address the Apprentice issues there, because many of these apprenticeships are either hours required, not by the time that they work on a project. A project might go from one building or job to another.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they those hours should be accumulative for those interns or those interns and apprentice apprenticeships to come be completed. So I'm very concerned about that. And I think Councilmember O'Donnell brought that issue up. So I think that that's a very important component of this negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in and in regards to the yearly report, that's automatic. As far as I'm concerned, it should be already automatically incorporated into any agreement anywhere that we enter, that there will be a yearly review as to our progress and these projects.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I support our original document, our original motion that that that's here without any other reiterations of it, because that can be worked out in the end. The contractual issue, especially now since the the horse has left the barn, so to speak, that all of these issues have been raised.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the city attorney has been paying attention, knows what what the concerns are by the council because we've raised them. But I want to raise one more and I brought this discussion up the last time we talked about this, is that you want to make sure that in this negotiation process, we have all our stakeholders involved'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And I and I specifically asked that we also include the the Legal Aid Foundation to be included in this negotiation. They have some great idea. They've worked some neighbor project agreements, a project labor agreements in the past. And I think that they should be part of this process, too, if not an active participant, to provide some some'",
        "'speaker_8': 'outside independent review as to what we had so that they could provide their expertize and guidance in this whole process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I really appreciate this robust conversation about this very important issue. I'm going to offer a substitute substitute, I think, that will encapsulate capture everything that is being discussed here. I like the the ideal of of of the existing document as Councilmember Urunga has stated his support for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do would like to include the annual review for fiscal impact and with the option to contract the compliance officer. If I can get a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Amount of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and that that does a couple of things because we do have a council policy that affords the city manager to contract anything under $250,000 a year. And I don't see that this individual or compliance officer will exceed that without council approval and it can be negotiated in this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and it also affords the community organization stakeholders. It opens it up for the city to to look for an appropriate compliance officer. So with that, thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a substitute substitute. Was there a second? You can have other duties as well. Okay. There was a second. And can I ask the city attorney on the third component of what Councilor Brosnan said? Can you clarify that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I'm not sure that I'm understanding it correctly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I might ask the maker of the motion, I have two items that he makes a substitute substitute to include the annual fiscal impact and the option to contract the compliance officer. I didn't know there was a third.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Item that wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There to contract the compliance officer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Contract with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Compliance that would remain an option to city staff to come back. And I'm very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So very similar to the original motion. But with that, with that little difference. Okay. So there's a substitute and a second on the substitute substitute. I still have more speakers on the list. Councilman Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So a couple of things. So this is an agreement. Would it not come back to is this we're never going to have a chance to talk about this again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city attorney, after you finish the agreement, does it come to the city council for adoption?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The way I read the motion is that we are to return to city council within 30 days. I'm not sure what it is we will have in 30 days to present to you, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will be have to get into the weeds on every single detail tonight. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It was my hope you wouldn't get into the weeds on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you for clarifying that. Secondly, I just want to I just want to say that I want to say that on the whole discussion about compliance, whether we should like contracted or hire it. In my experience, like we're building a library right now, all the all of that is built in like we are the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'principal on that project. We are bearing that cost. Right. But if it's a private development or or I mean, shouldn't that be built into the project costs? Like we shouldn't have like an ongoing like person on staff to do that shouldn't be that be a part of the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. The compliance the the compliance would normally be part of the project and yes, it would be built into the project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So would it be the same person? Will we have one compliance officer for the whole city, or were these be different compliance officers per project?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It might be a same compliance officer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think would be. We're getting into the weeds on stuff we shouldn't get into at this point, honestly. So I would honestly say, like let Charlie and the city manager go back. I think we've been very clear. Come back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's see what the document is so that we can we can vote on it. There were all a lot of motions and substitutes and substitute substitutes, so I can't make a motion. So I will just ask. I think we're going to vote on our motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would ask I'll just leave it leave it up to, you know, them to come back. Like, I don't know that we need the contract a like ongoing person. It might need to be structured differently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm okay with the substitute substitute. And I will I will take away the, the option for the compliance officer because that makes sense. I just want to get on with the vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There is Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I think the one thing that I want to make clear is that and I understand, Councilman Richardson, that, you know, we don't want to get into the weeds. But unfortunately and perhaps it's difficult for me as an attorney reading this document, there are some very serious directives in here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So it's and Councilwoman Gonzalez, when I originally made my comment, thought that this was a report back recommendation. It's not we're actually voting to direct the staff to engage in contract discussions, engage in a contract so the details of the contract matter because we pursue it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If staff is going to be compliant with this council directive, they are going to have to negotiate in certain aspects of this agreement, including potentially additional staff or labor. And so we don't know what the cost of this item is going to be for the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's the problem here. Nobody has an issue with the spirit behind it, the intent, all the great things it's going to do. We don't know what the fiscal impact is going to be to the city. And we have to look at and I appreciate what Councilman Aranda said about bringing the stakeholders to the table.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But, you know, we talk about this this person that's going to oversee these projects, we're talking all projects over $500,000. That's a lot of projects that they're going to have to be involved in if it's going to. Be a staff person, that's going to be a cost that we as a city are going to have to absorb'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So how are we going to do that if it's going to be something that's going to be built into the contract with the with the contractors who get the bids, then is it going to be something that's going to deter them from bidding on our contracts, especially smaller contracts?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is this going to be an additional cost that they're going to view as a deterrent from wanting to do business here? These are these are just concerns. And that's why I think it's important that we have as many options available to us as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I understand Councilwoman Gonzalez didn't agree with my friendly amendment. And I appreciate Councilman Austin trying to meet me halfway here, because it seems to me like this is an item where what we're hearing is it's all or nothing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's no room here to accommodate what some of my council colleagues might be concerned about. And this is this particular aspect of it. The compliance officer is so important that it's it's got to move forward. I think what's important about this contract is that it's five years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It provides local hire, it provides an apprenticeship, it allows people to be employed when those elements are met. Why can't we as a council work together moving forward on the additional items that we don't currently know the financial value of?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's my issue here is, you know, I'm trying my best to hold on to the importance of understanding that we need to have some appreciation, that there are some additional costs associated with this contract, and we should know those before we move forward, which and I don't know it when we're talking about stakeholders, I know that there'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are some you know, based on some conversations I had today, I know there was a lot of some assistance or input into this agenda item, maybe some boilerplate language. You know, we are the city of Long Beach. We are going to negotiate contracts that are best for the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so whoever assisted with boilerplate language or whatever we are, the city of Long Beach, we are going to draft contracts that make sense for our city. And that's and I would hope that my council colleagues would look to the spirit of this and say, what is what is the most important aspects of this contract right now'",
        "'speaker_7': '? It's the local hire. It's the threshold value, which is what they've requested. It's it's the apprenticeship program. Those are important. Those are things that all council people agree. But there are a few things they're concerned about. I'm going to meet them halfway so that we're not in a position where we're accepting a contract that we don't know'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the fiscal impact of. So I appreciate Councilman Austin. It doesn't go far enough for me because I would like city staff to be able to just analyze that portion of this contract. That would make me very happy if we could just know how much that additional impact was going to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are looking at a deficit starting next year all the way until 2021. Are we now adopting a new staff person for the city? Because if we are, I'd like to have some input. Maybe that staff person is someone that I want on the police department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Maybe that staff person is someone we need in a library. I mean, are we now hiring another staff by virtue of a play? That's important information. So we're not even we're just ignoring it. And and I think that that is wrong.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that if we, you know, we talk about collegiality and doing the best thing for the city, we have a fiduciary duty to make decisions that are financially prudent for this city. And we are if we vote yes on this and let's make make no mistake about it, I think that the local labor, The Apprentice, I'",
        "'speaker_7': 'am 1,000% behind you on that. Absolutely. But I have a problem voting on a contract that we don't know what the fiscal impact is going to be. And with 30 days, we could know that information. Why wouldn't we wait 30 days?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go now to Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's a point of order. I believe that. Councilmember Austin, accepting the friendly amendment of Councilmember Richardson, reverts the motion to the original item, which cancels out the substitute substitute. Would I be correct? City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's not correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, darn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However. However.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So tell me what he what friendly amendment did you accept? Because I don't think that we all got that down here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, he.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He did not, to my knowledge, and I did not hear a friendly amendment from Mr. Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilor Richardson asked to remove the $200,000. No, you did not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, there was an annual fiscal impact. Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's let's let's let's here still. And we're going to. Okay, I have the floor. So, Mr. City Attorney, there is a substitute substitute right now by Councilmember Austin, and it has two components. One is the review component at the annual annually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other component had to do with the contracting out of the compliance piece. Is that correct, Mr.. Austin, with the option of contracting. Listen, that substitute substitute is almost identical to the original main motion, with the exception of the review, which Councilman Gonzalez was amenable to and the option to contract out the compliance piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct? The city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's my understanding with the other discussion that was had on the main motion that talked about the referral to harbor and water and the removal of the specialty contract. And I think that one other item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was the five, that's all included as part of the. Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're all clear what the substitute substitute is right now on the floor. Okay, great. I have Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you all for the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, Councilman Mongo wasn't done. So Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So just to be clear, we're contracting out almost 50 contracts totaling more than $250 million. And the substitute substitute does not require council action for extensions of the contract out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor, Manchester City.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Council member Mungo. The city council item is asking us to negotiate that agreement. We would be coming back to the council with that final contract and if the decision of the Council at that time, currently it's a five year agreement with an evergreen, meaning that either party could cancel it with with notice, either you could amend that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'termination clause or the term of the agreement as when we come back to you and present what has been negotiated as we're directed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, it would be difficult for me to vote for an item that is evergreen. So that is my concern that I wanted to communicate to my council colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to go ahead and we're going to do public comment still. That's coming up. Are there any other comments from any of the council colleagues?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I called for the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Is there an is there more? Okay. Let let's let them make her the original motion. She has a comment and they're going to go to public comment. Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I just wanted to say thank you for all the comments. We've had a really fruitful discussion here. I want to remain committed to the fact that, you know, we need to make sure that, you know, certainly we understand that compliance coordinator component is very essential, but it does vary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is not the first time, you know, the city has done a play. I'm, of course, not of this extent, but we have a play for the airport. Is that not correct? Or we had one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Okay. And so this is we're not brand new to this. I trust fully and trust that our city attorney, our city manager will certainly make the right decisions when it comes to a compliance coordinator, whether that's contracted out or incorporated in the project costs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But certainly, I believe, you know, we still need to remain committed to this and make sure that we're just moving forward. So I you know, like many of us, we just want to vote on this item at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. With that, we are going to go to public comment on the item. So if you have public comment, please line up over by the mic. So please come forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm Ron Miller, executive secretary of the L.A. Orange County Building, trades on behalf of 140,000 men and women that are within our ranks and the many more that we hope to put in our ranks from your community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to thank you for the justified conversation that happened up here today. This is how things get done, and there's no mystery of these plays. We do lots of plays. The first one of the first ones was on the Hoover Dam.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're not the wolf in the forest. They're real and they're very successful about putting people to work and creating tomorrow's future workforce. They maximize your dollar spent. And when you're putting your local work, your local constituents to work, they're reinvesting in your city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And many of the points that I had planned to go over you guys covered tonight. So talking about partnership, we have the state building trades in Sacramento. They introduced legislation within the last couple of years. And I'd like to be able to tell you when it was, but there was an assembly bill for 36 and what it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'does is for compliance on public projects. You guys pay a quarter of 1% of the construction cost to the state for compliance. If you have a play, you don't pay them. You don't pay that quarter 1% to the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You keep it. So maybe that will help you find the money to pay for this coordinator. Right. But I want to talk about the careers, the apprentices that are put to work on your jobs from the trades that are in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They don't pay anything for their education. They walk into an apprenticeship. That trade is going to spend 30 to $40000 on that apprentice. At the end of the four or five years, depending on the link to the apprenticeship for that particular trade.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to become a journeyman. They're going to have a lifelong career. They're going to punch their own ticket to the middle class. And that's important in this day and age. Not everybody goes to college and they need to have a career where they can provide for their family, send their kids to college, and have a modest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'pension and a modest retirement. So it's very important that you understand these apprentices, their educations paid for by the journeymen on the project and the contractors. It's in a partnership with our contractors. That's who pays for that education.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's very important. And we have high standards. We rely on the community groups. We partner with the Urban League, with workforce centers, Youth Build Winter Group, which is locally here in Long Beach. We partner with all those folks to help break down the barriers for your community to get into our trades.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like I said, we have high standards and we don't lower them for anybody, but we work with the community. So thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Kevin Norton, assistant business manager with Electrical Workers Local 11, also a Long Beach resident by Councilmember Susie Price over there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Give them how. It's nice to see you all tonight. It's been a long time coming and certainly we're excited about the prospect of partnering with the city of Long Beach, with the IBEW and our apprenticeship program. We have 100 apprentices from City of Long Beach already and we look forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have about 1000 members that live in Long Beach, so we have quite a few people. So we look at this play is putting our members to work in their own neighborhood. So we think it's a good thing you're leveraging money that you're already going to spend.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the cost of a compliance officer when you're talking, you know, the kind of value you're talking about is honestly de minimis. You know, it's the cost that someone moves an outlet a couple of times on these jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They end up costing about the same. So we think it's a great opportunity to put local people back to work in Long Beach. And we're excited to work with you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening again, Mayor Garcia and fellow council city staff in public that's here today. You know, I want our members that are here for my BW Local 11 to stand. You know, we also have women, you know, that are coming into our apprenticeship programs that are, you know, happy to raise their families, raise them right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bring them up, you know, through a career and give them give them help, good health and good benefits. And that's you know, that's what it's all about. You know, given opportunities for disadvantaged men and women that, you know, needs their second chance to be given a career and in a IBEW apprenticeship program, you know, I, I can'",
        "'speaker_2': 'tell you, I myself, I've been in the IBEW for 18 years and it has changed my my life and my family to, you know, to bring up a good a career and a good family. So I urge the city council to adopt the proposal from Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we look forward to the project agreement when it comes up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Laurie Angell. I happen to live in town up here in North Long Beach, and I'm going to speak as a member of the public. I don't belong to a union. I never have, but that is not a big deal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I support the trades. I think it's important. I love apprenticeships. It's a wonderful idea. I agree 100%. I think the issues are very convoluted. I don't think it's ready for prime time. I completely agree with Suzy. I think that you're the cart's way ahead of the horse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you've got to pull back and you have to refer this to committee, have it cleaned up a little bit before you like rush out. I know you want to make a lot of people real happy tonight, but I just don't think you're quite ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gary Curt Plumber's, local 78. I represent about 2000 members with about 100 apprentices that live in the Long Beach area. I have met your city attorney and we haven't talked about this matter, but I have the confidence in him that he'll sit down and negotiate in the city's best interest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of the things that we've heard tonight are just small things that can be negotiated through. And I look forward and my members look forward. And if I have members I have members in the audience, they would stand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please. That is the face of the community we bring within. So I appreciate the time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Tom Guitarist, the business manager for the Insulators and Fire Stoppers I share with my colleagues at the apprenticeship program is his number one. And also they forgot to tell you that because most of the students don't go to college, all these apprenticeship programs here that are present, they get college credit for going to this apprenticeship program'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So that that is really important to see that. And also since Long Beach is the home of the veterans, I'm saying let's move ahead with this thing. Let's give a better chance. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is. My name is Ernest Roberts. I am executive director of TV Jobs. And we've been working local and disadvantage worker policies in the last 17 years. And in fact, the products, the agreements, the policies and the about the public works at the Port of L.A. are kind of modeled after our program and the high speed'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and the nowadays Metro Metro's policy. So we have a lot of experience in this area. And I can tell you right now a few things about what you guys are discussing, which you should kind of pay attention to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of them is that when you talk about local, you can't talk about positions. You really should be talking about hours. Positions gives the contractor too much leeway to be able to maneuver around. And you're not going to get what you want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've we've experienced that and big time. And when you talk about the local hire, I would strongly urge you not to forget about the disadvantage worker and try to expand that as much as humanly possible. Because when you talk about getting a local worker person to work, yes, you're going to get the the trickle down effect for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the local economy. When a person gets paid locally, when you get a disadvantaged person, including a veteran, we also consider disadvantage. Back to work. Somebody coming from you as vets, you no longer have to pay for the support of services for that individual.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you get the benefit of the trickle down economics and you save in taxpayer money when you don't have to pay those extra support of service costs. And that that includes a lot of the different at risk elements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would suggest that you take a close look at them. And one final thing, we found that the jobs coordinate has a jobs coordinator, and I'm not sure if that's what you meant when you were talking about a project coordinator, but a jobs coordinator is the person who is the intermediary between the local community and the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'nonprofit faith based organizations and the training organizations to interface with the trades and with with the contractors on the ground. You actually have to have somebody to talk to these contractors on the ground in some kind of a regular basis if you want this to be efficient.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that jobs coordinator then is kind of the the interface between all of the community and that that brings a lot of benefits to you. It brings the benefit of the bringing the local community involved to support the project that you want to commit because they're committed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do they get something out of the project? It saves a lot of time and labor and stuff. If you have a single entity with having 18 job developers call the apprenticeship coordinator particular union. So and is and by the way all the projects we work on is usually paid for by the contractor, by the GC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not paid for by the, by the government. And in terms of cost of compliance, there's several ways to address that. Sometimes it's an independent contractor and sometimes it's internal, but we're available to help with because I haven't heard anything here that we haven't heard a dozen times before, and we're working with Legal Aid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there's anything we can offer in terms of assistance, we're there for you. Oh, and do the play the field as best.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Next speaker, I'm also going to I'm going to be cutting off the speakers lest anyone behind Jeanine or she the last one. She lost one. Okay, cutting off the speaker's list. Janine's the last speaker. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are you guys doing today? My name is Rashad Moore. I'm a proud apprentice from Local 300. But before these guys came, I'm a resident of District six out here in Long Beach. Upon come home from incarceration, I knew that I want to get a job and change my life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I went to several programs out here and it really wasn't too many means of like a play program. So I reached out to L.A. and from that opportunity these guys gave me to play in to local hiring to resume.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was able to obtain a great job. I was able to get a career. I was able to get a house and get credit. I was able just to have an opportunity, a life which I wouldn't have had had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I not had these opportunities given to me by me being out here in Long Beach. It made a big difference for me to speak on this situation. I believe that we should definitely brain is to Long Beach and really consider how many lives we will change in this community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're giving that opportunity to not just live in this city, but build it up, be a part of a union, and be a part of something that's meaningful in that represents not just to be a proud union member, but be a proud citizen of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not to say, hey, look, I was raised here. I was born here. With this play, they gave me a chance to provide for my kids, my family, you know, look at to drive down the street to say, hey, we built this and we can we can go in there, spend some money there, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I really think that, um, you guys really consider this movement, and it'll do great justice to this city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is Kevin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm a resident of Long Beach. I go to when.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'New youth build.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm here to express my support for local hire. And I feel youth like myself should deserve good jobs. Good paying jobs like the construction site, construction crews. And I feel like it would help us in our future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker. But.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Albert Ramirez. I'm a job developer with Winter part of YouthBuild and just wanted to thank the youth for sticking around. They've been busy all day. You know, they're there. You know, I give them a lot of props.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And also to the sisters and brothers here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been a very long night. But that being said, I work with youth. We service youth in Long Beach. And I see on a daily basis every day students come into my office. We work on their resume. We work on job readiness.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everything. You think of the interview process. But. The stories about how and why students want a good paying job, especially in construction, and how that can change their lives and their family lives is so critical. I hear it every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Ramirez I want to get to work. Mr. Ramirez, what's going on with the construction? What can I do? How can I be a better person to get these jobs? And it it really hit home. And I cannot stress enough this local hire, ensuring that a strong local hire that's targeting our youth because they're our future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also wanted to share with you all, counsel, that we have 250 signatures in support of a strong play that has the independent job coordinator, as well as the local hire piece. That being said, we applaud all efforts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please let us know how we can continue supporting your efforts with a strong play and local hire. Thank you. Thank you. Next week first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. My name is Alexander Torres, Golden Seat, and I'm the executive director of Women in Nontraditional Employment Roles and the Youth Feel program that you see today. I'm here in support of the play. I want to encourage you to really look into local hiring and hiring people from Orange County and including L.A. County is not local'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hiring. Local hiring should be for those people who need jobs in our own communities. And that is our job. Our job as an agency. And your job is public officials to be ensure that first, our local hire are people that live here, especially in the low income communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand that there's a lot of controversy about was not including my area but I can assure you that in every council district there are kids that I have drop out of school, that there are in programs like mine that they want jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's not is not about boundaries, is about the city's citizens of Long Beach. I speak as the executive director. WYNTER But I also speak as a resident of District two. And I do want to see a strong two Tier three tier Long Beach residents local hire.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And our our final speaker. And then we're going to have a hello council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Janine Pearce with Lane, Los Angeles Alliance for New Economy. I'd like to really show our appreciation for a healthy discussion for the for the mayor and also for the city attorney for keeping us all straight on what was happening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really appreciate that. I want to echo everything that everybody said before me, which is really fantastic, that we have a lot of labor groups and community groups and groups that work as job coordinators saying that the city is on the right path.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that there's no disagreement that the intent of this policy is is a great intent. There are a couple of things that I just want to shore up on areas that we feel like could be tightened up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And at Lane, we've worked on six of these plays in L.A., around the L.A. port, around Metro, and with the city of L.A. and the things that made all three of all of those successful was that it had an exterior jobs coordinator.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That it included a requirement that it wasn't a best effort. So while there was some discussion around, is this a best effort or is it a requirement, both words were used. And so we would like to ask that the city makes it a requirement that there is an attempt at that 30%, that that is a requirement and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not a best effort. We would also like to make sure that the hours part is included when we talk about apprenticeships, if we're not talking about hours and there's no guarantee that those Apprentice are going to be able to finish their work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so that part is really, really important. And the city has actually had some some legal issues around implementing plays. And these are some areas where you can make sure that you protect yourself. I think that that was all of the main issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But let me double check. 30% targeted hiring. We do feel like that local hire piece has to be with high unemployment zip codes because this is a policy that will help address poverty in the city. But it's only that 30%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You still have 70% for the rest of the city to apply. It's not locking out anybody else in Long Beach. It's just saying, let's give these guys a first chance. And and we have experiences with Expo Line Phase one and with MLK Hospital, where they fell short when they didn't have a job coordinator and they didn't have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it as a requirement. And so I'm thrilled that I know that this has been a project in the works long before many of you were on this council. And I want to thank the sponsors of this bill to make sure that this is going to actually happen on your watch.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's make sure if we're doing this big policy that we're doing it right. And I also want to applaud the building trades and all the community groups for all their work on on bringing this to our city. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We're going to go to a vote. I just I'm going to make I haven't made any comments are going to be a very brief comment and then we're going to go for a vote. One, I just want to just reiterate that sometimes democracy gets messy and and that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to make sure that we've everyone up here has talked about things that are important to them. What I what I heard from everyone up here is general support for a citywide project labor agreement as far as how we get there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's different viewpoints and that's okay. So I just want to make sure that I kind of that I reiterated that. And as you know, because we're in this location, it's also a little bit more difficult to for councilmembers to weigh in and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q And so that's that creates a little bit more problems, but I think we got through that. Okay. So I want to thank everyone for that. I just want us to to remind us we're really here to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach has and has had a very strong history with project labor agreements. You look at the port projects, you look at the airport, what we're going to do with the installation of a play at the Civic Center, which was done recently, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'History of the trades. Working with the city on labor agreements has been very strong. Quite frankly, if you look at the projects, they have come in on time. They've come in under budget or at budget. The the protection that Project Labor agreements bring to projects is incredibly strong and I strongly believe that if you look at the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'research that is out there right now on the value of project labor agreements, the research is incredibly clear that they provide stability, not just financial stability, but labor stability to the project. And so I think that the fact that we are going to get a city wide project labor agreement out of this discussion is a very good'",
        "'speaker_0': 'thing for the city of Long Beach. In addition, I want to concur on a couple of comments that talked about compliance. We have to put a lot of attention to the compliance piece because that is where we know that there are big gaps in the system currently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think if you talk I know Mr. City Attorney, you've talked to a lot of the trades that are out there doing projects, and we know that the compliance piece is really important. And I and I needed to also mention that our city attorney has actually been doing a lot of work on this issue already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I want while we're all having this discussion up here, I think it's important to know that our city attorney is prepared. He has been meeting with the trades. He's been meeting with Mr. Miller and everyone else, and he's prepared to bring something back to council that is the protects the city, that is a model for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for for the state of California. And that is going to ensure that we're doing projects in the right way. And so this council will have an opportunity to get the information that Charlie is going to bring back with the specifications of the agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are at the end of the day, we are going to have a citywide project labor agreement and that's a good thing for Long Beach. So I want to with that, we're going to go ahead and go to the votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a substitute substitute, which essentially is the most the main motion with the additions. The $500,000 limit is where we're at. We're going to do the annual review. And there is this option of the the compliance piece of contract of contracting that out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. That's the first the first part of that. So that is a substitute substitute. I'm going to call for a hand vote. All those in favor of the substitute substitute. Please raise your hand. And it's one, two, three, four, five and six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that motion carries all those. Oppose that. Please raise your hand to oppose Mr. Clark. I believe the vote is six two. Okay. Thank you very much. And thank you all for coming out and for providing your voice to to the debate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Next up is, I'm sure another one that won't be controversial at all, which will be which will be item number 32.'",
        "'speaker_2': '30.'",
        "'speaker_0': '32. Yeah. Yeah. They asked for 32. That's right. Yeah. So we're going to just take like a one minute recess to let those that need those of you to exit the room to exit. And we're going to begin in just a minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Which items?'",
        "'speaker_4': '32.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I just got to go.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Well, let's just wait to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everyone who would have known you would have died. Just kidding. But you had to stop to stop the car and go. Yeah, it was. You know, we just kept going. I just said, come on, keep going. This one was really fun.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The tickets and tickets? Yeah. Yeah. Really good time. Of course. Of course. I just wanted to let him know that he still has. Most of the time he. So that's why I appreciate and that's like you said, he's really has been everyone has been doing a debate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's right. As long as we know it's okay, it was good. And so I'm just trying to you know, I can't hear everyone very well. I'm trying to say it. It's an interesting situation. You want to go get a soda?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Our. Here. Yeah, but. Somebody's got to run. Harvey Weinstein. I would love to see mix.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I get really.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, I know, right? Yeah. That's in the family tree. You got to take care of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I see that. You want to get by on my way there now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back in the classroom. Give me some.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Snacks. I just think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would. I would. 30 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If he's done more equipment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to we're going to restart the council meeting. We're going to restart the. So if I can have everyone take a seat. We're going to go and get started, if anyone coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, everyone. If. If you need a chat, please. Let's take it outside. We're going to start restart the council meeting. If I can have the city clerk go ahead and do roar and then we're going to adjourn from a recess.'",

Council Councilmember Roberto Durango. Councilman Al Austin. Councilmember Rex Richardson. Mayor Robert Garcia.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm here a guys. There's a lot of kind of noise out there. So for those people that are outside, if we can either just thank you very much. And is is the air conditioner on, by the way? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we can maybe crank that on and it's pretty hot up here, so that would be great. So we're going to Mr. or Madam Kirk, can you read the next item which we're doing? We're doing 32 and then we've had a request to move up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe it's item 22, which is the school district item. What is it? Well, I've been I'm only going by the by the request that I've officially received. So. Next item is 32 and I'll figure out what the other requests are after that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So item number 32, Madam Clerk.'"

    "Recommendation to request City Manager to work with the Director of Economic and Property Development to create a policy to allocate all proceeds from the sale of city owned properties to fund blight removal, ongoing economic development efforts, revolving loan funds for small business establishment and growth, local incentives for business to locate or expand in the City, and key infrastructure investments.  These proceeds should be tracked and directed to the project areas where the former Long Beach Redevelopment Agency (RDA) properties are located.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Item 32 Communication from Councilmember Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilman Andrews and Councilman Austin. Recommendation to request City Manager to work with the Director of Economic and Economic and Property Development to create a policy and to allocate all proceeds from the sale of city owned properties to fund and track properties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Property project areas where the where the former Long Beach Redevelopment Agency properties are located.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm going to turn this over to Councilmember Rex Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So, first of all, thanks to everybody who hung out. I know it's been a long, long meeting. We're not quite finished yet. We still have a little bit more work to do. Secondly, before I get going, I hear that this is really noisy and just cut on so we can turn it off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's turn it off. It is kind of noisy, so it's hard to hear. Great. Thanks. We'll just. We'll just keep the doors open.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. So this item was crafted in the spirit of the former redevelopment agency. And I'm going to give us a little bit of background here on where this has come from. So in 45, the California legislature enacted the California Redevelopment Act to assist local governments in eliminating blight through development, reconstruction, rehabilitation and a number of other activities'",
        "'speaker_3': '. This gave cities and counties the authority to establish redevelopment agencies. The Long Beach Redevelopment Agency carried out its mission of enhancing the quality of life by improving blighted and blighted areas of Long Beach, revitalizing neighborhoods, promoting economic development, creating jobs, so on and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In order to meet that mission, project areas were established to capture tax increment from property taxes within those project areas, to be reinvested within those same neighborhoods and focusing on blight removal within those established boundaries. In 2011, the state of California eliminated all California redevelopment agencies, effectively eradicating a vital tool to revitalize communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in 2012, the Legislature passed AB 1484, I believe, which outlined a process for local communities to dispose of former RDA properties. The city of Long Beach currently has roughly 50 properties that will be sold spanning north Long Beach, central west in downtown Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The successor agency is currently awaiting approval of its long range property management plan, which outlines the disposal of these properties. If authorized, the City of Long Beach may have an opportunity to direct one time proceeds derived from the sale of these properties to be spent in alignment with the original mission of former Long Beach RDA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, blight removal, economic development programs and so on. So the purpose of this item is to, you know, I think there is a thought here that we've got one last opportunity here with this redevelopment. These redevelopment properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were purchased with tax increment generated in the project areas. When we sell the sell these properties, it won't be a lot of money here, but we should carry out the original spirit in which it was intended. Now I want to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My motion is going to give some flexibility to the city manager. City manager will be able to come back with a recommendation on how he would purchase those. But what's the crux of my motion is that they should generally be invested within the project areas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The general area is now. When redevelopment was established, the boundaries were not. Perfect. People complain that the Port of Long Beach was in the North Project area. People complain that certain areas might have been cut out that might not maybe shouldn't have been cut out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so I want to give some flexibility to city manager, just to say the North Project area, the West, you know, Central, all the project areas and the the sort of community and communities of interest around that, those areas, we should be able to think big about how we really want to invest along the spirit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it may not be whatever comes back doesn't necessarily have to be tied down to the specific rules of redevelopment because we're not bound by those anymore. But the general spirit within those communities of interest. Now, here's an example.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's say that a project area ends on the West Side, and and but there's a specific interest on a corridor on the West Side. And the you know, there might be an interest of a facade program, a business loan program that might extend just down that corridor right outside the project area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think that that should be. That should limit the city manager on what he comes up with on his program. I want to give the flexibility, give the city manager some flexibility to come back and let us have a have a discussion about tangible things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's it. That is my motion. So I'll move the item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's been a motion and a second to the item. Councilmember Austin, I'm going to have then I have Councilmember Price and then you're Ranga.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then I want to thank Councilmember Richardson for bringing this item forward. This is, as he mentioned earlier, this this item wasn't a brainchild of the city council. This is one that is borne of our community, our residents here, former North Pack members, Central West Pack members, project area committee folks who worked in the redevelopment process for many'",
        "'speaker_6': ', many years to eliminate blight, to promote economic development, to to do some great work in North Long Beach and central area and including the West Side. This was something that they said we need to have happen. The city council is now listening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would encourage my my, my the rest of my colleagues to to hear those those cries as well. I like the fact that Councilmember Richardson is looking at communities of interest because our park areas are defined by specific redevelopment, areas were defined by specific boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This extends that to to to to other areas that may not have been drawn in that park, but it gives the city manager the discretion to, for example, improve the Santa Fe corridor or to to add other areas of the West Side that may not have been cut into the park areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so with that consideration, I mean, this is an item that that really spans not only District eight and District nine and District seven, but the sixth District, the first District and the second district as well. And Fourth District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is this is a this is an item that that can now benefit many communities throughout our city. And so I would ask for support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Has there been a motion yet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I would like to make a substitute motion to adopt this recommendation, deleting the second paragraph of the recommendation that targets the proceeds to be directed to the project areas where former Long Beach Redevelopment Agency properties are located.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The reason there is someone has the floor. So continue. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. The reason that I'm making this motion is that I believe that, first of all, I think while I appreciate the spirit of bringing it forward, I do believe it's it's slightly premature because we have not received approval yet in terms of where the money can be spent or if it's coming back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think it's a little bit premature. Having said that, I think that the money should be used to support our citywide economic development discussions and efforts. We have talked this council since we took office. We have talked about the need to increase our revenue and promote businesses within the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I believe that any money from redevelopment should be used to support the efforts of the city to promote economic development in all areas of the city and to incentivize businesses wanting to establish throughout the city wherever they may want to establish.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That money could be utilized to help small businesses establish through perhaps loan programs as the item calls for or a waiver of license fees. As we've discussed, this is money that can allow us as a city to help all businesses establish in the city of Long Beach, regardless of where they want to establish.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I note that in 2012.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There were a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Project, there was a Pacific Electric Right of way project in District six that was developed with RDA funds that was $9.5 million. Right now in the third district, we have a long stretch of the Pacific Electric right of way that is in desperate need for funding and to be redeveloped and we don't have the funding for it'",
        "'speaker_7': '. This is an example of a citywide project where these monies can be used and there are no other moneys available for. Improvements in the area other than our general fund, which we don't have. So having said that, I believe that we should take a city wide as opposed to a district specific approach to this particular item.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If and when the successor agency reports back in a manner that's consistent with the reallocation of these funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have next I have in order to have council members you Ranka than mongo than Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mayor. I too have issue with the second paragraph and how it reads, because the seventh district was basically a redevelopment a long time ago and was never really included. Council member Austin did mention the fact that we touch upon the seventh District is touched upon by the Central Park, the West Bank and the North Park'",
        "'speaker_8': '. But very little redevelopment was present in the seventh District. Very small, very little. Those those agencies did not touch the seventh District at all. So that's before my time. I had no impact on it. But I think here's an opportunity for me to correct that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so this is why I have two issues with both of these proposals. One was the the the thought about having a close proximity to communities of interest. Redevelopment. I have an issue with that because I'm not sure that that's going to work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the other hand, having a citywide project, I have an issue with that as well because how do we work out the priorities? She has a right away that she wants fixed. I have a park that I need fixed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How are we going to prioritize that? So my and if I can, who is going to repeat who read back the the the the motion. The city clerk is not here but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the what the what the two motions are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now what what's what's what's the one motion that that's what we're at right now on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion that's on the floor right now is a substitute motion by Councilwoman Pryce. That is essentially the recommendation is presented minus the second paragraph. So it's requesting the city manager to work with the director of economic development to create a policy that allocates the proceeds from the sale of city owned properties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, I can't support that either. What I'm a friendly amendment or amendment is, is to take it back to the city manager, for them to come up and develop a plan that is much more inclusive of how and much more clear in terms of how these redevelopment funds will be used citywide, if that's if that's the plan'",
        "'speaker_8': '. However, it has to be very clear that it's going to be inclusive, that the areas that are that are identified as being blight and now may be the areas that were there already. But there but there are there's there are areas in the seventh District that were not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Included.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In those areas. And I want to I want to make sure that I have an opportunity to bid for or include a project in the seventh District that will that will be inclusive of all areas, not only in terms of of communities of interest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Communities of interest is a little vague for me at this point. So, I mean, that's my most.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point of order.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I. Hold on. Only one person has the floor right now. Let me. Councilmember, you're Ranga is wrapping up his motion. I want to get that clarification that I have a speaker's list. And I know that the authors of the motion are trying to make a clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll get to everybody first. Councilmember Urunga, I believe you have made a substitute substitute motion or was it a friendly amendment? I'm asking Councilmember Frank.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Nobody else, an amendment to take it back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I'm asking customary ranking. You ask for friendly amendment. So you're asking for a friendly amendment. I'm I'm I'm I'm assuming of Councilwoman Price's motion or of the original motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It would be to councilmember prices. The motion that's on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you're.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Asking. Okay, in that case, I'm would substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you're making a substitute substitute motion. And from what I understand, the substitute substitute motion is to ask the city manager to come back with options to the city council, for the council to look at as to how we could create some type of policy for how for the any sort of revenue or income we may'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get from the dissolution of properties. Is that right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And with with it with a plan of how those will be mitigated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with with with plan and background as far as what those would look like. Yeah. Okay. So Mr. City Attorney. So just just to be clear, the substitute substitute is a motion to ask city manager to come back to council with a plan and or options as to how he would present the how would what his plan'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would be on the dissolution of the properties and the revenue created with some plans as to how that would work. That was about right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's my understanding, because substitute substitute eliminates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was there a second to that substitute substitute? Was there a second to that? There was not a second to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who stuck with the game to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be vice mayor? Was that a second term?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, it's not. I have a clarifying. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have a I have a couple of people with clarifying questions. So let me get to those. Let's go to speakers. Oh, that actually, I'm doing the clarifying questions first. Clarifying questions first was Councilmember Ashton. You had a clarifying question to clarify something, not something I because you're on the speakers another point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just wanted to clarify something because we we talked about communities of interest. And I think in the spirit of what Councilmember Richardson was, and I think he mentioned that in his remarks, in the spirit of what he was trying to achieve is is not excluding the west west side.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so would it be out of order for me to to to attempt to make a friendly amendment to Councilmember Richardson?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you're you're you know, you're you are coming up right after council after Councilman Mango. Why don't you make your friendly when you're up on the on the board? You can make the friendly really easy when you when you're up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Duly noted. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have one more clarifying question and we're going to go back to the speaker's list. Vice Mayor Long thought that you have a clarifying comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did. In what I heard from what Councilmember Urunga had described, it actually sounds the same to me as the motion that Councilmember Mongeau and praised the motion the Councilmember Mongo made. Hi. Sorry, I'm looking at Councilmember Price, but I'm saying mongo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, it does sound the same to me. So if I could ask. Isn't that the same? No, no. How is it different? Because Councilmember Price asked for the item to be just the first part of the recommendation, which is asking the city manager to create a policy to out would you would the city manager not be coming'",
        "'speaker_4': 'back with this policy? He would be. And so the policy could be a set of options. I interpret that as actually the same. It's a nuance, but it's the same. And so instead of complicating it, I think we can take what Councilmember Yang is looking for, which inherently is in that motion, it's in that language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if it if it's the same. Does anyone want a second? Roberto's substitute. Substitute?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Only if we acknowledge that it's the same. Because I firmly believe it's the same.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Listen, it. It sounds. It sounds the same to me, but I. But I want to make sure that contrary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think we can revert back to the original maker of that motion because the language is right here and I'm hearing would count. Well, my colleague, Councilmember Turanga, is asking for and I wanted to have the assurance that it's actually the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if I can hear from the city manager or the city attorney, what is your interpretation of the first part of that recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The way I understood Mr. Councilmember during his motion, and he can certainly correct me if I was wrong, is that he wanted the city manager to come back with a policy for the allocation of the sale of the city, proceeds with no limitation on it as to the blight removal, economic development, etc., which was the motion by'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Price. So that's the difference that I saw between the two motions. I'm not sure if Mr. Rangel agrees with the way I understood his.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That that is not my understanding of the motion, that that was not my intent of my motion. The language that's in the first paragraph is good. I mean, I have no issues with that at all. In fact, that's what it should be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That that's what it is. The issue that I had is with that second paragraph, obviously, and I to strike that. And that was a motion that that Councilmember Price is making. The issue that I have with that is the nuances of striking that and still goes into a general fund, yet not being able to identify priorities in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'regards to what we define as either communities of interest or which are the ones that are, say, in a 1 to 10 scale of blight and what what conservation, what comes next, and those priorities. That's what I have an issue with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Mr. CITY.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then I think council member or Vice Mayor Lowenthal is is correct in that the motion is the motion by the councilmember from the third District, and that the city manager would be coming back with a policy for consideration by the entire council on those items.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So his motion is essentially the same.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Arango So at least the city the city attorney is interpreting your motion to be the same as that as Councilman Price's motion. So I just want to make sure that with that, before we move forward, whether you agree with that assessment or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Mr. City Attorney, because I know that he was having a side conversation real quick here, can you just real reiterate one more time your thought of both motions, and let's let Councilman Ringa clarify.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. The motion by Councilmember Price, second by Councilmember Mongo deletes the second paragraph and leaves the first paragraph in its entirety. The way I understood your motion is that you would like to see options brought back by the city manager, and obviously this requires the manager to bring back a draft policy for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there. So you're really not committing yourself this evening until you see the policy that would be created by the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Well. In essence, what I'm wanting to say, what I meant by my substitute motion is that I want to take this document that we have before us right here. And take and give it to the city manager to come up with a plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So I think that I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think that if.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's if it's if it means striking the paragraph two and that's it. That's what that's the interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, the way I read it in court from Richard Attorney, but that is essentially striking the second paragraph. So I think the first paragraph asked the city manager to come back with a plan for the council to review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It could include various options. Is that right?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That that is my understanding, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the substitute substitute comes from a hearing, according to the city attorney, in the way it's interpreted, your motion is identical to Councilman Price's motion. And it would be. It's on the floor. It's on the floor already.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A point of order, Mr. Mayor. The motion died without a second. If we are reading this to death.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's all we're clarifying. So. So that's the motion. Thank you. That's. We're clarifying. I want to make sure that everyone understands who we're talking about. So that was the motion that was made. There was no second correct account.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sum rearranges motion. Okay, now I have one. Mr. Mayor? Yes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If I might still have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have. But she did have the thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Miss Mungo, I had the plaque for clarifying it. Just to be abundantly clear, it's not beating a dead horse, because it's very important for me to make sure that one of my colleagues understands that what he wants to see for his communities, for his district, is actually very much it's right in the motion that was already made'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And that's very important to me. And I wanted to understand that from Councilmember Urunga. And I'm thankful for the time that we spent, and I'm glad that we arrived at that. It's not a waste of time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go back to the speaker's list. So I have Councilmember Mongo, then Austin and Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Thank you. I think that we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Significantly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Ahead of the curve on where we have options. First and foremost, I want to thank the Economic Development Committee, specifically the staff members that brought forth a staff report that had this particular recommendation in it several weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And with the tweaks that have happened now, it kind of reverts back to Councilmember Price's motion. Really goes to the vision and mission of what Economic Development Oversight Committee is responsible for, which is helping set the policy for the city that has the greatest advantage for the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city that sometimes you could live on the border of a city and a job in the night or excuse me, at the border of a district and get a job out of the other side of the district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so what I would like to say is thank you, Councilman Price, for caring through the vision that the three of us had at a previous council budget oversight I'm sorry, the budget oversight, Economic Development and Oversight Committee meeting, which is that we should be looking citywide to make the greatest impact for all residents when it comes'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to economic development, workforce, business growth, business support. So with that, I'm going to be supporting your motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Next I have is Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And let me just say that my mom lives in Detroit and she's the only person that I will allow lecture me. I don't need to be lectured by anybody on this diet. I think everybody here is an adult.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Secondly, I'd like to just speak to the the equity issues in terms of distribution of public funds. The RDA areas were set up for the RDA areas and to improve blight and economic development conditions in the RDA areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's be very clear about that. North Long Beach. West Side. Central areas do not benefit from tidelands funds. You know. No, we don't. We don't. I'm just going to say we don't benefit from them. And so the RDA was set up specifically and in these areas we're set up specifically to address conditions in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've we've utilized the tools and resources I think extremely well to the credit of great city staff or city management. I see Amy Bodak, our Development Services Department and a lot of hard work and dedication from residents who have spent a lot, countless, countless amount of sweat equity and brainpower working on behalf of this community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I'd like to offer a substitute substitute motion to. Include the recommendations, as has as originally brought forth with the second sentence, and include including the communities of interest, the West Side and Seventh District. Was that a second?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's there's been a substitute substitute, which is the motion on the floor. And I believe the second was from Councilwoman Gonzalez. Okay. Next, I have Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So I wanted to just have maybe a reasonable discussion. I feel like, you know, the first concern here with the substitute motion was that it wasn't the appropriate time. So I want to ask city staff, have any cities that received approval of their long term property management plan yet?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mike Canwe. Mayor, members of the city council. There have been a number of cities that have received approval of their long range property management plan. So far, so good. Most of those cities, though, have had very small number of parcels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have 259 were a bit overwhelming, I think, for the state. There hasn't been an approval of a plan of our size.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So some cities have received approval. They haven't gotten to the size of cities our size, but it would be appropriate, more so prudent to prepare for it as we were anticipating it. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Preparation is always good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are you preparing yourself for the approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From the council? Richardson We have been drafting RFP in anticipation of approval so that we could issue them as quickly and prudently as possible. We also have a slate of of real estate brokers to whom we would issue the for sale properties and have them listed as well as soon as we have approval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we are indeed our city preparing for the approval of the long term property management plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Secondly, before we get into heated discussion about like where this money is, I would like for the public just to know exactly how much money we're talking about so that we can really have an understanding on what what this discussions about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So could you please shed some light on what is the anticipated value of the properties that are listed for future future sale?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am sorry I don't have that number at this time. I'll have to report back to you on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, let me let me let me ask this. Where do we have a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'List of those properties? Yes, indeed. I think they were distributed today. Hmm. So yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would you mind just stating for the public where those properties are?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, there are they are in former redevelopment areas. Is that so?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this item, there is a breakdown. There are two categories. This is for the future development, correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is for sale?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And Central there are 946 FS, so there are 15 parcels in central Long Beach for sale. In downtown, there are ten for future development and one for fuel for sales. So that's 11. In North, there are eight for future development and seven for sale.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's 15 in West. There are six for future development and one six for future development and one for sale. So it's 15, 11, 15 and seven in central, downtown, north and west. So my question is, how were those properties specifically acquired by our city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First, I think I'd like to clarify. I don't believe those were parcels. I think those were sites like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Site, an accumulation of parcels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Accumulation of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Persons, though, likely be sold by site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so future development properties were traditionally assembled and acquired by the Redevelopment Agency for Future Development for uses consistent with the strategic guide in that redevelopment area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they were acquired by the art redevelopment agencies within by the budget within the project area? That's correct. How were the budgets within the project areas? How were those funds derived? Where did they come from?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm assuming they would come from tax increment from the increased property values since the time the redevelopment project area was established.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the property properties can. So the tax increment came from those local communities central, downtown, north and west.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. I believe that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So based on that. The city. It is very comfortable administering funds through, you know, by boundary. We administer our Titans funds that way. We have CDBG funds that we craft and have to spend in certain ways. We've established that this is not a new process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're already making preparations to do this. I think the public just needs to know this is the fact is this is talking about taking about 50 the proceeds from 50 properties specifically located in low income, downtrodden, blighted communities and investing those in programs that aren't specifically targeted those communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And secondly, the funds generated are not it's not going to be a lot of money. Whatever comes back, whatever we derive is going to be over a period of time. And the state hasn't even determined whether we can only keep 21% of that the taxable what the taxable proceeds are for the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we might be talking about, you know, not that much money over a period of years, so to say purpose that city wide, you really diminish the impact that you can make. Whereas there are still sitting there existing programs today that if we would invest money in facade programs, revolving loan programs and really target those a certain'",
        "'speaker_3': 'areas, it becomes a rising tide, lifts all ships and it also helps us to raise our property values. So I just wanted to, you know, I mean, my my motion is that what we're going to be voting on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to make sure we go through that process and have that discussion, because I believe the the residents deserve to hear those those responses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next, we have Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So I just want to reiterate as well, of course, this is not a new idea. We've been discussing this prior to many of us even being on the council. I've only been here for six years, but I know it's been an ongoing discussion and having these and retaining the redevelopment funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I believe firmly that this is a citywide policy. This is a citywide attribute that will benefit all of us. I'm going to give I'm going to run over a list of a few of the items that just have happened in my district alone to give the council an idea of how this really relates to citywide project'",
        "'speaker_5': '. This isn't just us working in silos. We really have made great progress. Just in the First District alone. We've, I think, made progress of over 20, almost $25 million in seven years, just invested in the first District alone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you can imagine with the other districts what that means. But we've done things like Armory Park, which will be taking care of the the most dangerous intersection in the whole city. We've done the courthouse. That's the city wide asset, I would believe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pump Station on the west side, surveillance cameras. Harvey Milk Park, which is the first park named after an LGBTQ leader. Seaside Park, which is a park that is in one of the second highest in violent crime areas in my in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are all collectively, I believe, citywide assets. And so we don't have access to other things like Tidelands. We don't. And we just approved a pool that was a city wide asset. I think that we need to make sure that this goes back to their original intent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, as I mentioned, we had about $25 million invested just in new parks, corridor improvement, small business improvements in some of the highest violent crime rates, some of the most impoverished neighborhoods and severely deficient buildings and blight issues in the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would just ask for our support for your support of the council to make sure that we continue to move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Now I have Councilmember Durango.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Since the my original motion. My motion, anyway, died of. Or, let's just say, was not approved. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think perhaps it was because I misunderstood. So I I'm going to make I'm going to probably ask a few questions for clarification from Councilmember Price in regards to her motion and what it means.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Does that first paragraph still stand as is with with removing that second paragraph? Because if I heard you correctly, you're talking about the possibility of developing some areas that are not blighted and have no need for redevelopment or in those kinds of situations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When you're talking about that, that. Right away. I don't see any right away in the third district that really is blighted. I mean, it might be underdeveloped or not developed, but in regards to being blighted, I you know, I don't see that where there was blight in the sixth District when they corrected that, that right away, it'",
        "'speaker_8': 'was blighted. It was horrible. There were there were, you know, drug addicts there. Prostitution was taking place. All those types of things that that that we want to get rid of was I was corrected or addressed by redevelopment money.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's where I guess I'm a little confused as to what your emotion is because when it comes right down to it, I don't see a whole lot of blighted areas in the third. In the fifth, there might be some in the fourth and there and there's a few in the second.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I don't you know, I don't see that type of blight in those areas that I see in my area in the seventh District. Then that's that's the clarification that I want to get.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman. Absolutely. The first paragraph should stand as is. It's supposed to address blighted areas as well as economic development. And I don't want to get into a subject subjective determination in terms of whose area is more blighted. I'd be more than happy to give you a tour of this particular right of way that I'm talking about, because'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you would agree very objectively it needs some help. But this isn't an issue of trying to grab what you can for your district. It's we as a council made a commitment to economic development. And economic development means increasing our sales tax revenue, among other things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And where in I would be more I love your suggestion that the city manager come back with ideas of how best we could use this money to support our collective mission of economic development. So it's not just about removing blight, it's about opportunities for businesses to bring in sales tax revenue for the entire city, whether that be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in whatever district it may be. So that's you know, there are multiple things listed in paragraph one. I agree with every single one of them. And I do want to make well, it's probably not the appropriate time, but a couple of comments about the pool.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not sure how that relates to anything and Tidelands funding. I would love for staff to give counsel and education on how long the second and third districts and some of the will have received Tidelands in comparison to RDA funds and what the limitations of Thailand's are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, you know, to have that discussion I think is unnecessarily divisive. The point of this was how can we allocate money so that it supports our collective economic development purpose?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And that and that's part of the problem that I see there is that. And there's a mixing of words here that that are confusing me further. You know, I'm an old man, so, you know, sometimes I. I get lost in my own mind.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that when you talk about the first paragraph in this in this motion here, and then you talk about the general issues of economic development, that's confusing to me, because when we're talking specifically about areas of blight and and the need for economic development, I think it's in those areas that are blighted, that need that economic development'",
        "'speaker_8': 'not as a whole lot in general. That that that's what I'm trying to address here. And that's why I'm concerned about just putting it back into a general plan for economic development. It doesn't ring with me because I still have issues in the seventh District that are specific to the seventh District, specific to the blight and and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the and the economic development that I need in order to make my seventh District thrive. So that's that's where I'm coming from. Now, if I can ask now the attorney and the city clerk again, can I have a re affirmation of what the motion is that we're working on right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is the substitute substitute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you can read it back to me, you know, I may be a little selfish here, but let me get a reiteration of what it is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The substitute substitute motion is a motion by Councilmember Austin, second by Councilmember Gonzalez, to include the recommended staff action and the second paragraph, adding that it will also include communities of interest, the West Side and the seventh District.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I have. Have you next? Have you next? Let me let me real quick. So city attorney. So. Cosby Renko, you got that. Okay. I have Councilman Richardson for clarification and then went back to the speakers list.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So since all of the motions have included the first part of the original motion, I thought I would just re highlight the fact that the original motion was for the city manager to come back with recommendations. The discussion here is only about how wide we go when we target these resources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Therefore, I'd like to just say that communities of interest is not buy by my motion or by Councilman Austin's motion does not necessarily limit to districts. If there is an adjacent community, leave it up. Leave some flexibility of the city manager to say, hey, this is, you know, a priority for Cambodia town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It may not entirely be in RDA, but this might be a recommendation. This might be a recommendation. There might be a project on Santa Fe or in the downtown that might not be included. So it leaves that flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At no point that we say this is specifically what you need to do and said, come back with a recommendation on the policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go back to a few people that want to speak. I want to just make a couple of comments. And actually, Councilman Richardson and I think had a pretty good conversation yesterday about kind of my point of view on the item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to I think it's it's somewhere close to what some of the folks are talking about. I don't know that anyone here up here disagrees that there are certainly areas of Long Beach, particularly those that were formerly had RDA, areas that have more blight than others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a fact. There are parts of the city that have more blight than others. I think what the where the discussion where I'd like the discussion to go is what I think management's initial intention was, was to bring back a plan to the city that one would address the areas that are most affected by blight and that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'need economic development, which are the areas that we've been discussing, the north north area, the west area, central Long Beach. And there's certainly other pockets throughout the city that is I think everyone agrees that that need to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think what some of the other members are trying to get across, and I would agree is there what what I mentioned the customer Richardson is I think that the initial motion, I think limits a bit the ability for for management to bring back some city wide ideas that could be part of this that could lift all'",
        "'speaker_0': 'boats. And so I think that there is that we can still address. There is no question that if we're going to do blight removal and address that issue, that's going to be focus in certain areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's going to be a big chunk of what is what of where this money is going to go. But I also believe that there are citywide programs and there are other parts of the city that are not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think, Councilman, your income makes a great point. There are huge portions of the seventh District that were left out of the RDA process, not just in West Long Beach. That unfortunately would not be covered by the initial motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that there has to be room to have some citywide opportunities. And so I say that because I think there's I think there's a happy medium there. I think that we should recognize the fact that it's likely that a majority of these funds should go to the blighted areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we should all we shouldn't close off having some citywide economic development initiatives for the whole city. And so that's my $0.02. That's where I think the motion should go. I think that you should allow staff to come back with options for the council, but we should be able to come back and say, here are the options'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we can do. We can focus on blight removal in these parts of town which need it the most, which is going to be north, central, west parts of downtown. And certainly and there are parts on the east side as well that have blight issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And here are some citywide initiatives that will help the entire city, which is also inclusive of the Northwest, but everyone, including East Long Beach and other parts that also need economic development. I want to remind the council that this council, through the budget, approved a new department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The department also needs some type of funding support. This this money, by the way, is going to be housed in this new department in economic development, economic development and property management. And so I think it would be nice for this department to be able to think creatively about what we can do citywide to help everybody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I hope that's where we go and that's not where we at right now. But that's my $0.02.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So at no point I'm not sure that this motion or councilmember price motion or councilman or my original motion. I'm not sure that any of them really preclude like let's say that there was a tool that's managed by our new department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it does you know, it does support economic development activities. How would you approach it if you said, hey, look, open, open encounter, for example? This is a program that the city's interested in working on. It's going to cover all project areas in addition citywide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would that be something like an option under either of the iterations of the motion that you could bring back as a recommendation? It's a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City Attorney. I mean, I can't if I'm wrong, but I think the original motion, though, precludes that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. The while it's not a defined term, communities of interest, the discussion has been it has to relate or be adjacent to the redevelopment areas to follow with the spirit and the intent of the redevelopment law. So by definition, you would probably be eliminating some areas of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if there were a tool that could work in these areas, like if for some reason the original the original motion passed, would you just like craft that tool to only work in certain areas? Or would you be able to come back and say, look, here's where the motion might need to be tweaked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is what this is what we came up with as a recommendation. What could be adopted? Like, are you limited right now? Like and how you what your approach your what your approach would be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. We're being told to come we're being directed to come back with a policy with options. Options, excuse me on how this money could be spent in agency, geographic areas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And communities of interest. That certainly would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Preclude.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Us from going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Too far away from what we would consider a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Community of interest. Community of interest is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really definitely defined in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Redevelopment law. It certainly wasn't a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Health and safety code and I don't think a community of interest would be if you jump three or four miles away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if. Councilman so where I want to get to is what would be something that like what what do you need to hear in order to focus your, your resources into a certain area but still have the availability of think about certain tools that do impact the whole city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like where's the balance?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we're just given the opportunity to come back with options, that would look at the entire city, maybe focus on the agency areas, but not but also look at other areas of the city. We could certainly do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But right now, the way it's crafted, we again, we would be doing this, but he'd be precluded from looking at areas that are.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Not a community of interest adjacent to a geographic boundary of the agency area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I want to hear public comment and maybe revisit that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I do have two other speakers I want to make sure I want to share. They don't want to speak now first or wait. Vice Mayor Lowenthal, did you want to make any additional comments? Okay. And Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to go to public comment, so please go ahead and line up over here. Thank you all. Just over here on the on everyone's right. Please, and make sure that everyone can just introduce themselves for the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And please begin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hi. My name is Sean Darren. I'm a system manager of the Uptown Business District working in ninth and eighth District. And I just wanted to lend support to Councilman Richardson's recommendation, speaking from someone who from the perspective of someone who works with businesses and property owners every day in the business district, this would directly impact'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the economic development within the business district. For instance, many businesses don't have enough money to improve their facades to get new signage. And so this some of these funds could be directly allocated towards the signage and improvement of the facade so that it attracts new businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that attracts customers more importantly. And so and also it improves the look of the the area. Also, it would also help fund some startups. I get I get calls all the time from businesses who want to come into the district, but they don't have the funds to start up in there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're always asking for city programs or any kind of funding that would be available to help them start their business. And also this would also help impact existing businesses who want to relocate to the area. And it will also impact things like security.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to make the business district safe for residents to shop there and also for businesses to relocate there, which some of these funds could be allocated toward that as well. And and also things like security. We have a we implemented a private security firm which helps decrease some of the Long Beach Police Department calls that would'",
        "'speaker_2': 'redirect some of their resources. And also it would help fund some of the businesses to get security cameras and to have a more robust security system, which would also help impact businesses as well, and help customers come into the community and help it impact the safety of the community to have a safe business district for businesses to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and customers to shop in. So I just wanted to lend my support in the business district, support for the initiative and to help some of these blighted properties, which there are plenty in the business district. There are vacancies which have, for what I understand, have been vacant for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we need to do something and we need to redirect some of these funds so that the original intent of the redevelopment agency to help some of these by two areas is is finally realized. Thanks. Hello. My name is Larry Cherish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I might ramble a little bit now because I'm tired and I think that's kind of thanks to you guys. I work for the city of Long Beach. For many, many years, I did. I worked in redevelopment. I did economic development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was the senior economic development officer for quite a while. And then for a short while after Jerry Miller left redevelopment to go to the city manager's office. I was the acting bureau manager for economic development, and so I know a little bit about economic development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I created several of the loan programs I think that the city still has, and I think I was the one who did the first facade program studying down on Pacific Avenue in the seventh District, maybe six. At any rate, let me tell you this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The money that's coming out of North Miami Beach really ought to stay in North Long Beach to take money out of north Long Beach, which is really got terrible problems and spend them citywide and in districts that don't have terrible problems would really be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You might be able to do it, but it would simply be immoral. It's like stealing. These are these are really low income neighborhoods to compare, say, A right away and the sixth district to A right away in a third district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You do like Roberta was saying, you just can't do that. The money has to stay where the money was generated. You're taking the money from the communities that absolutely need it the most. I'll tell you this. If you create if you take that money and you put it into a loan program, for example, you're going to get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'businesses lined up from shore, from the fifth District, lining up to get that loan money. And you're going to struggle to make those loans in North Line Beach because it's hard to make loans in North Line Beach. What you need to do with North Palm Beach money is spend money on businesses in North Long Beach and find'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a way to do it. You. You just can't be taking it away like that. I think it's just wrong. I came to this meeting to talk about the airport, but I just couldn't help myself when I heard all this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why not? I worked there and put my heart and soul into economic development for such a long time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Laurie Angel, Northland Beach's Project Area Committee Chair for North. And this is near and dear to my heart. I've worked on this for 15 years, and unless you've been here and you've worked on it, you really don't get how important it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It isn't just a pot. It's not just found money. It's money with a purpose. It's it's money that was intended to fix problems. And if all things were equal in the city, I could say, sure. Just divide it up and give it to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they're not. We have a lot of catching up to do. And most of the serious problems occurred during the L.A. riots. And it has been a difficult struggle. We've lost all kinds of businesses. And I don't know if you have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Streets filled with empty, vacant buildings and lots. But I'm going to tell you, as Larry said, is that the folks that live in the wealthiest areas with the best businesses are going to be able to find money. People up here are not going to be able to find money to support their businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I tell you, if you make this area productive, it will contribute ten fold to the city in terms of property taxes, sales taxes and business taxes. So to deny the ability to skid the grease, to give, you know, grease the skids in order to be able to help this area take off and contribute to the rest'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of the city, you are denying the city the additional revenue that you would have otherwise to help you in other areas. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You know, my name is Mike Maltz. I live in a nice district, but I'm a Long Beach boy. I've been here since the day I was born. My family's been here since 1918. I have most of my family buried in the Sunnyside Cemetery on Willow.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I've been raised on the West Side. I spent 20 years in the seventh and eighth districts, and now I'm raising my grandchildren in the ninth District. I wake up every morning and I look at two vacant lots, one of which we're going to have taking care, of which is the library.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The other. I look at the South and Atlantic corridor, which was going to be the village. Who knows what we're going to end up with now? We want to see the money kept where the money needs to go in the areas it was intended for.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is what everyone I have talked to in my area has said we need. I wouldn't start a business in this area. Because of the fact that the way it looks. You got to be able to do something to promote businesses in the area.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And right now, I can't see it happening. We are getting some stuff done, Rex. Steven Neil Vallance worked on to get our streets looking better, to get the lighting up and the things that have accomplished on Long Beach and the Atlantic corridor.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But the major issue I'm afraid of and what I saw back in the seventies was now you're talking about a civic center. And my biggest fear is the moneys we do get back from the sale of these properties will go back downtown and everything will go back to the way it was because we had to straighten this'",

        "'speaker_4': 'You go up and down Pacific Avenue right now. And you will see more vacant storefronts. I just can't even believe I'm up here. Saying this to everybody when most people should know how bad it is in the sixth, the seventh areas of the fourth, if not for C PAC or Isabel Park, wouldn't be what it is today'",

You know, I have to say, first of all, I believe that the duty of city government is to build public safety facilities. But the city of Long Beach didn't have the money to build those facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So redevelopment money jumped ahead. Instead of focusing on the projects that were developed over many, many years. And they built the West Side Police Department. They built the North Police Department. They built Station 12. They're building the North Library.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So all of those moneys that were put to those projects could have could have brought our community so much further ahead. But it didn't because it stepped back for the better of the entire city. I have to say, Suzy, you said that we have a need to increase revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Stacy, you said that that it should be about the greatest advantage for the whole city. Then I want you to consider something. If property tax revenue is the number one source to the general fund, which it is, then further development to improve these neglected areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they have been neglected for a long, long, long time. Then when you improve those neighborhoods, you're going to improve the property tax values, which is going to generate more money to the general fund so that it can so that it can be provided for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if you don't take the time and you don't look long term for visioning and planning about how you're going to bring these neighborhoods that have been allowed to go down the path that they're down with no source of money coming in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And by the way, I think you ought to also be talking about a new source of revenue, or, as you stated, we're going to be in trouble. We're going to be in big trouble. The Tidelands, I know you don't like to hear that, but one, two and three benefit greatly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank God we have that. Or we'd be in No. One, not one. Okay. I'll take that back. But we got the Naples canals, we've got the pool, we've got the aquarium, we've got the beach improvements. We look really good to people that come to visit us in the downtown area.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm going to tell you that for a number of you, for two, four, three, four, five, you don't come close to what some of these other neighborhoods are looking at. So I ask you, please keep the tax increment money in the neighborhoods that it came from.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'John Doe Lottery, eighth district. I think when you look at the spirit intent of the RDA, when it first came out, it was basically meeting, I think what Councilman Mango and Price, I think it is what you're saying, bringing up the collective of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Is basically let's make these blighted areas, places where businesses want to go.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we can then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Start collecting that tax revenue. By keeping those funds there, we can accomplish exactly what you want to see happen for the good of Long Beach. More money coming in. Spend that money where it needs to be, where it was originally, excuse me, designed to be in these blighted RDA development areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hello. My name's Phil, so I'm here. I was part of North PAC. I was the chair of the Economic Development Subcommittee for that PAC. And. I think a lot of things that were said have been said that I was going to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I would want to say that we attempted in North Park to try and get develop the businesses in the area there. And we did go in to ask the economic development. Officer for the city to help us, which was we got very little help.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we had to we were having to do it on our own. So that's where we were using some money. The one thing I want to bring up is. Something that no one else has. I think you covered everything else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was on the planning commission up until about a month ago. And we'd have issues come up on the Planning Commission for different projects, low income housing. And also we had the. As the fifth District would know, the area, the mental health facility.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a lot of those things come up and people, they raise those issues. And between that and homeless shelters, what ends up happening is those projects, after all these discussions from other areas, they get dumped into the west and north side of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's taking all the things for the entire city. The city has obligations, arena requirements for housing. It's for the whole city. But where does it go? It goes on the west and the north side of the city. We're taking a lot of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The brunt for the whole city. And I think we'll also get because we just went through the. Marijuana ordinance. And part of that is on that is going to have farm sites for if we're growing marijuana. And it appears I would probably that most of those sites are going to also be on the west and north side'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I think. This Council should have an obligation to realize what the burden that these in this area has taken and try and do. Give them the money. It's a blighted area and give them money to support some of these things because they're carrying the load for the rest of the city on a lot of these things'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you. Good evening, Council Mayor. Staff. My name is Dan Press Burg. I live in the ninth district and I reiterate all the things that have already been said, but there are some things that some people seem to have forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The North Park started originally when we started forming just a team was in 1996. It went until 1998 when we had our first meeting and Laurie Angell was there. Although she was not a pack member as part of the pack, I served as secretary for about two and a half years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was the vice chair for seven years, part time chair off and on till Martha took over. And then I was her vice chair for a couple more years. I was entirely involved. Some of the projects we did did not start in our areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a there is a necessary brownfield removal in the third district that is now a nice set of condos. We've done wayfinding signs in the second next to the Queen Mary, although it was considered part of the North Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For two and a half, three years. We paid the rent in exchange with the port. For the aquarium bonds. And we also managed to scrape together $14 million. For the Middle Harbor project, which we'll never see, as well as moneys for the police stations that will never get back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm sure Council Member Ranga remembers what the Green Monster look like, what it was like when we had to pave the streets going into Cabrillo. Rio, what it was like when that park opened and how much fun it was and some of the other things that have led to what we look like throughout the whole city'",
        "'speaker_2': '. The only thing I can say is, is the money needs to stay where it originated. It needs to stay here. We need to roll up our sleeves and start working with it. I've seen many of these counties that many of the council members over here, they come up here, they visit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They all say the same thing. Just do what's right. It's ethical and it's honest.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening, Mayor and city council people. My name is Darlene Broom. I live here in the ninth district and it's been a challenge to live here in north of Long Beach. I set. And I've heard all your. What would I put this way?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I've heard you say everything that affects you. But what affects me? You. You're talking about it right away. You're talking about fixing parks. Well, what about a grocery store? We don't have a grocery store. What about a restaurant?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Where's the cleaners? Why do we. As Ninth District? Residents have to give our tax dollars from our property to the entire city. It doesn't make any sense. It's a known fact. If you want a community to grow, its dollar needs to balance in its community at least ten times.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I've been to all of the districts here that have those businesses. Your dollars are bouncing at least 15 to 20 times. It shows it. What do we not? Earn that with our dollars. Do we not get to keep our money and fix our neighborhoods so our children can go to the store and not to the liquor store'",
        "'speaker_14': '? I'm so happy that you all had to drive up here tonight. When you got here, it was light. You saw where we live. Why does your neighborhood look that way?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's getting better. Darlene's getting better.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Jeff Roe from Grant Neighborhood Association, one of 11 neighborhood associations in North Long Beach here. I can't say I followed all of the substitutions and the friendlies, but and some of my colleagues from other neighborhoods of flood, I think it became past their bedtime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I am sure that I am speaking for them when I say that, when you're considering how you're going to spend this money. If you would keep in mind that the legacy of the blight in the redevelopment areas is here and it's with us and we have to deal with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for considering that. Good evening again, Craig Cogen with the downtown Long Beach Associates. And I really appreciate the spirit of dialog and the conversation. I think we all lost when redevelopment was dissolved. I think we all agree to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now it's a matter of how we manage life without redevelopment, and we're trying to do that in our downtown as well as other business corridors. And I think everyone agrees to the fact that we need to put our energies together to be able to address those issues that we are now really navigating uncharted waters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for those of you that feel as though that downtown has benefited, you're absolutely right from redevelopment and from the private investment that's been made in our downtown, it is and does still continue to serve as an economic engine for the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if you feel as though downtown is complete by any stretch of the imagination, I will invite you to join Councilmember Gonzales and Vice Mayor Lowenthal and I to take a tour of some of the neighborhoods in their downtown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I assure you that it's not complete. So, yes, the Tidelands have helped the waterfront, the convention center, the pike. It's polished, it looks nice. But I will take you to neighborhoods that don't benefit from it. Seventh and Daisy, North Pine Ninth and Elm, seventh and Alameda, serving as gateways to our center city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those areas need help too. So whatever you decide. That's fine. We're going to work with whatever the decisions are. But the work is not complete. And I think all of our business corridors and all of our neighborhoods feel the same way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. Good evening. I am Jack Smith. I live at 50 Alma Avenue in the second district. That's an East Village. There are lots of places in town that need help. But there are only a few places that generated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This redevelopment money that we hope is coming back to the city. I can't imagine there's any question at all. As to where that money should be spent. I live in a family of four boys. Or a Brit was raised and lived there anymore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I worked hard selling my lemonade or my cotton candy or running my festivals. And earned by money. I spent my money. Occasionally. I helped my family with the rent. But it was my money. And I decided what was done with that money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's how the PACs worked. This money was generated and earned by these areas that were part of the redevelopment areas. We hope it's coming back. And it needs to come back to the areas where it was earned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not spent. Other places just because there are other needs in the city. We agree with that. But it was earned in these areas. That's where it needs to be spent. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you all for those for those comments. We're going to go ahead and go back. Let me just reiterate kind of where we're at right now. So we have three motions. We have a substitute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Substitute, which is the motion that's actually on the floor. I'm city attorney. The substitute substitute, I believe, was the motion by Councilmember Austin. Can you repeat the motion for the attorney?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. The substitute substantive motion by Councilman Ross and second by Councilmember Gonzalez to approve the recommended action, including the second paragraph and adding to the language of the second paragraph, so that it would also include communities of interest, the West Side and the entire seventh District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all of these I know that we're short of councilmember, but all of these motions require five votes to pass. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a simple majority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Support for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So it. There. There are there are eight people here. So in case of a tie.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Five votes or four for the motion would fail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I'm saying. So you need five votes, correct? Okay. Same thing. So we have a motion. We have a substance. Substance on the floor. All those in favor of the substitute. Substitute. Please raise your hand. One, two, three, four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion fails. Okay. The next the next motion is a substitute motion by Councilwoman Susie Price, I believe it was, if. Can you repeat the motion?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. The second substantive motion was motion by price, second by Councilmember Mongo to accept the step, the recommendation with the deletion of the second paragraph.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All those in favor of the substitute motion. And again, same rules applies. It's five votes. Please raise your hand. Okay. One, two, three, four. Motion fails. Now we have the original motion, which is a motion by Councilmember Richardson, which is essentially the the main motion that's been presented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What was whether you want to read that it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Was the main motion with an amendment to include communities of interest. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to just point of order and I will now that is back in my wheelhouse. There was a lot of healthy discussion today. I think what I'd like to do so that all the failed motions don't fail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to throw some red meat out there and see if folks actually want to play ball. So the name of the game is City Manager is going to come back with some recommendations. I want to ensure that the main investments are made in these project areas along with the same spirit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, there were some legitimate concerns about that. I've heard about, you know, some of the lines being incomplete. So I'm okay, including some of the language that Councilman Austin said to change it as well as I've heard that there is an interest in the city manager said he is not limited.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He is limited by my motion, the original language to invest in any city wide programs. So I would like to open up my motion a bit by saying 25% of resources can be invested on citywide programs in your whatever you come back with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But at least 75% of what happens needs to go back to the within the original spirit. Everybody's not going to be happy with this, but this is what policy and government is. So we did a little bit based on this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be the change to my motion if the second year of my motion would accept it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I make one suggestion? And you may not like it, but I first of all, I want you to I mentioned I agree with the spirit of what you're trying to do. And I think that you're correct that if you think about where blight is, a vast majority of it are in the project areas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is a fact. And so I think a majority of those resources should be addressing those areas. I wouldn't put a percentage on it. I don't know if you're open to the city manager just coming back with options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just think a percentage is very is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is prescriptive. I don't think everybody's going to leave here feeling comfortable. But if everybody gets a little bit of what they're looking for and we're speaking to the general spirit, we've we've already established this is not too premature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This thing could happen tomorrow. It could happen next year. We've already established that there is some interest in speaking to citywide priorities, given that every single dollar of these every single dollar of this was generated from the TAC, from the tax increment in those areas, it's only right that a majority of those funds be reinvested in that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'spirit. But we are part of the whole city, and the whole city should benefit whether whether these dollars came from District five, District three, District 98. So I do want to put a threshold if folks would be amenable and I'm open to some discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we didn't waste all our time here on three felt motion. So I want I want to hear from some of my colleagues. I'm back in control of the motion and I want to pass something tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would encourage us. I mean, if all this fails, we're going to be back at this again. So if there's questions or if we can noodle something out, I would recommend we do that. So are there any speakers that I have, Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to support Councilman Richardson on this. I think the spirit of it is to give our city manager some options. Obviously, the most blighted areas are the impacted areas. That's obvious. But as a city, you know, we don't keep our sale, our property tax revenues in the districts they come from.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We share them throughout the city. And we look at city wide alternatives for four things. So there may be opportunities that they identify, whether it's to address blight or an economic development opportunity that's really good for all of us that would bring in a major company or allow us to have headquarters here for something that may fall'",
        "'speaker_7': 'outside of the specific boundaries of this area. So I think that I appreciate Councilwoman Richardson, you know, kind of moving a little bit on his item, because I think that's not just being collegial, but it's taking everybody's interests in mind so that we all feel like the spirit of your motion is honored, but that we also have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that the city manager has some options and that might come. We have some options in terms of recommendations that they might make to us. So I support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would also like to lean in the direction of support. I think that because of Brown Act requirements have been not able to talk to Councilmember Richardson about these issues since he brought forth an item that we had previously discussed in a different form.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And one of the things that I thought was really important. Let me say my parents lived in the eighth. I lived in the seventh, my grandparents lived in the seventh. I worked in the ninth. There was a shooting across the street from my office when I worked.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the ninth. And so I've been all over this city. My grandparents lived here, my great grandparents. It's. There are all sorts of areas and our economic development and oversight, economic development Finance Committee has been talking specifically about incentives that I think would be most helpful to areas in the project areas.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'However, in in the idea of simplicity and helping small businesses, we've talked about things like waiving business license fees or reducing the cost of coops or whatever they are, and specifically in areas that have been vacant for 18 months or more, in areas that have been vacant for two years or more.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so what we want to be careful about is that percentage, because in all of those vacancies that have been vacant for over 24 months, etc., those areas need help. And the market has told us that they need help because no one will lease them for the prices that they're being set up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so with that, I'd like the the city manager to come back with flexibility, especially in those areas of citywide programs that help specifically on rentable areas. And I think our original discussion, which I think was. Ms. understood in a future dialog was when I own a property and I want to sell it, what do I do'",
        "'speaker_10': '? I fix it up. And so I was hoping that we would invest in a cascading program where we would be fixing the blight around a property before we sell it. So if we have $1,000,000, let's invest that million dollars adjacent to the property we're about to sell so that it will sell for more.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we will have more money to invest in the next property in the RDA area, which would keep it in those areas. But I hope that the city manager and the Economic Development Chair will take that into consideration because my biggest concern is getting the highest dollar for the properties we sell.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Both for property tax reasons, but also for direct revenues of the 21% we may or may not get from the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So can I have the motion repeated to me? On the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. City. Attorney, there's only one motion on the floor. Can you repeat the motion for concern, Brosnan?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. The second was by Councilmember Austin of Councilmember Richardson's original motion, with the amendment that the city manager can come back with options, including up to 25% of the proceeds to be used citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I call for the question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of questions being called because any other speakers, I think we can go to the vote. Is there one more? So do you have an objection if Councilwoman Gonzales makes final comments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just say I don't think I could support this just because I feel like we have compromised so very much in our respective districts. And I think it's, you know, something that we're talking a minimal amount of money anyway, you know, and for us to divide that in a percentage into percentages, I don't believe would would do'",
        "'speaker_5': 'us any any good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I'd like to see some dialog.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What do you think would be more fair?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before we, before we go there, the questions being called. So, Councilmember Austin, are you willing. Are you calling the question, are you willing to continue the dialog.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, in the spirit of collegiality, let's continue to talk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just because I want to be in a place where we can we can make a decision on this tonight, I want to be considerate of some of the interests. They are good ideas, city wide, the majority of these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my hope was that in my original motion was that a recommendation might come out that could help some citywide efforts. But this is focused on our area. Right. So if there was a platform or some initiative that does help and benefit the whole city, that these dollars could be used to support that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But City Manager highlighted to me that he was limited by my motion. So the reason I said I wanted to make sure that the bulk are it goes to what the original spirit is. That's why I thought that we can, you know, say a bulk is 75%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, if you think that they we should adjust that number, I think we should just be realistic tonight about what we can politically pass. But at the same time, I'm open to having that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just think that we have you know, there's capital improvement projects that we've had, you know, that have been citywide that we can look at. I believe that that we can find funding for if there is something that is of priority to the other districts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we need to look at it that way and find additional revenue for that and work on it that way. I don't see using this fund the you know, this these outdated funds for well, citywide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The citywide stuff wouldn't necessarily be investments, as I understand. It wouldn't be like investments in a project, so to speak. The 25% has to touch every part of the city. It has to be truly citywide, not district specific.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need to be a citywide economic development investment. Then an example could be and maybe maybe the city manager could chime in on what he might. I mean, he's spoke the least in this whole line. And what I'm thinking is, like they've talked about like open counter is something all the districts can use that's not resourced'",
