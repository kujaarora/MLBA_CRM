        "'speaker_0': 'Is there any public comment on this item? Please confirm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, counsel. My name is Dennis Banks. I'm the applicant's representative for the application at 3 to 9 with Willow. Just like to give a quick little background. Um, the owners of the operation actually own the sport. The barber shop next door, Long Beach, finest barbershop.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They've been in the community for 13 years. And they would like to stay there as part of the community outreach for this application. We've spoken with the Wrigley Neighborhood Association, and we've actually spoken with them about some of the concerns they've had to address those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also, we have reached out to the Wrigley's going Green Association and the Wrigley Neighborhood Alliance. Also, we've been responding to people through social media, the Wrigley Neighborhood Community Group. We've been answering their questions and concerns as well. Many people had concerns that, well, the place was formerly the 710 bar where there were some issues in the past'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And what we've tried to let the make the residents aware is that this will not be the same thing. This will absolutely not be a bar. This will be a family oriented, sit down restaurant. We have a menu.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a floor plan. All the old layout, such as pool tables and things of that nature, have been removed and will not be coming back. Also like to mention as far as outreach over the weekend, we went to everyone within three foot radius.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We knocked on doors. We talked to people about it and we actually had a community meeting last night. A little over 15 people showed up. And there we talked with the residents about the concerns and issues. They had to just help, you know, educate them, make them understand that this will be a restaurant, a family oriented restaurant'",
        "'speaker_5': 'operated by two people who, you know, live and work in that community and will want to put something that will be the benefit to the community better. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. My name is Lynnette Firenze and I'm a 2926 Eucalyptus Avenue. And I just wanted to say that we are looking forward to this tenant. It used to be a bar and now it's going to be a bar and a restaurant, and we're glad that it's going to be occupied.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just have a few concerns. One of them this was is just a bar. Now they're adding a restaurant and they do not have an on site trash enclosure. So there's a lot of food waste. And so I would like to see a trash enclosure also that should be large enough to accommodate recyclable materials.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's unclear what the hours of operation are going to be. I think they might be 2:10 p.m. and I don't have an issue with that, but they are adding outdoor dining on the West Side and there's a single family home directly to the north, no alley separation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I was hoping I would recommend maybe the outdoor dining area hours end at 9 p.m. daily. The applicant should provide a parking lot lighting plan for approval by the city just to make sure it's safe. And also a security plan with the hours shall be submitted and reviewed and approved by the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will. There is a landscape planner along the north elevation. We'd like to see that just landscaping installed in the existing plan or if possibly they could add a small planter area because a parking lot does not have anything there right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So maybe we'll go in chosen at a landscape planner and then maybe just a trash receptacle near the front door in the parking lot. So people have a place to throw away trash and it end up on the street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if the door on the west elevation could be closed during operating hours. So if there's a noise, it doesn't interrupt the adjoining residents. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. Do I have to give my name.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Colleen McDonald, 525 West 19th Street in Wrigley. Good evening. I just wanted to let you know that I did speak to Dennis earlier, and we're pretty much in agreement on the six items that Lynnette just mentioned. I support her letter or her requests, especially as it has to do with trash.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those are very important elements to me as a member of the Wrigley Clean team. Um, so I'm very happy that this establishment is coming to Wrigley of. That's about all. So thank you.'",

We are incredibly thankful to Councilmember Pearce for her leadership in championing the addition of parking meters to our business corridor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We'd also like to thank the Public Works Department for their support in guiding us through this new venture for our association. Fourth Street is one of the most thriving business districts in Long Beach, and the addition of parking meters is a welcome addition to our business district, as it will increase parking availability to the many guests who'",

Additionally, new parking meters will ensure our business association has a sustainable source of funding to support our efforts to continue to beautify Fourth Street, enhance public safety and increase promotion of our diverse array of businesses and nonprofit organizations in our district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On Fourth Street, we pride ourselves on our diversity and longevity as a small business and organizational hub. In an increasingly corporatized business environment, parking meters will only serve to enhance our ability to get out the message that by shopping, local patrons are not only supporting our thriving poor street community, but investing in the overall prosperity of Long'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Beach. Thank you again for your support. We are incredibly grateful and look forward to future partnerships with our elected leaders and with city staff. And with that said, the Board of Directors does respectfully request, based on previous conversations we've had with city staff, that the that the City Council consider amending the recommendations so that our meters are'",
        "'speaker_11': 'available for up to 3 hours for our patrons as a district that has both restaurants and the only single screen movie theater in the city of Long Beach, we want our parking meters to be available for folks to attend a dinner and a movie without having to leave halfway through the movie to refill their meter and also'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to consider implementation of parking meter fees Monday through Sunday. And in addition to just Monday through Saturday as Sunday is an incredibly vibrant shopping day for our local businesses. So thank you again for your support and we look forward to partnering with you on this new venture for Fourth Street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Any other public comment on this? Okay. I do have I do have a question and I'm obviously very supportive of the meters. But in light of that record, I just wanted to understand the three hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are we doing it anywhere else in the city currently? Just wanna make sure it's something that we can actually do. I'm assuming there's been some conversations already about that. Mr. Beck.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor, members of the council? No. Typically the parking meters are set it to our time limit. It's a challenge when we consider whether or not to meter on street parking. Certainly we do our due diligence and make sure that we're in a business corridor, that we're primarily adding metered parking for the business community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the reasons that we do on street metered parking is to create turnover. So customers coming to frequent, those businesses have an opportunity to park and we don't see some of the long term parking that we are experiencing in business corridors that don't have parking meters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So all of our parking districts are currently limited to a two hour time limit. I certainly support the Fourth Street Group and all the wonderful things that they've done over there to promote business and become a thriving business corridor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it would be somewhat of a challenge for us to extend to 3 hours. I certainly support the addition of Sun, if that's the way they want to go and we can work with them on amending the hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if they want to start earlier or go longer, that's certainly an option for us as well. But it would be a challenge to have one parking district that is different from our other parking districts. When you start thinking about it citywide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I only ask a question because this is a first I've heard of the three hour chain. So I just want to make sure that I understand it because I also absolutely support the requests in front of us and the meters and everything else is because I've actually never seen a three hour common anywhere else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to understand, Mr. Beck, I don't know that I've ever seen three or maybe it is common, but is there are there other beach cities or other areas that have three hour meters?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think what we've seen, Mayor, is that off street parking is usually longer, but on street parking is usually more limited. And so when I think about the fourth street corridor, I do believe we there is while it isn't as many parking spaces, there is an off street lot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe that has an opportunity to extend the number of hours for the off street lot versus the on street parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So do we know if there are other other metered parking districts anywhere that have 3 hours? I just I just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Don't know my knowledge on street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But this three hour issue was discussed prior to today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not with myself, but possibly with my staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Count Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I'm I'm hearing about this request right now, but I have to say, I want to hear what the rest of my colleagues have to say about this. But I think sometimes we push too hard to have consistency throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in the process of doing that, we forget that we have different needs all throughout the city. I know, for example, in Belmont, sure, we wanted to extend our the five minute zone to a ten minute zone because it makes more sense for the types of businesses that we have on that street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think sometimes if there's something that's going to work better for one community versus another, we should be willing to, you know, go outside the box. These are smart meters. So unless I'm missing something, I don't know that it's going to be an additional burden on city staff to somehow and perhaps I'm missing it somehow be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'able to facilitate the three hour request. I think that's probably one of the advantages that was brought to our attention when we were considering smart meters is that we could have different programs in different parts of the city and tailor make them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I'd like us to be able to do that, if that's what the community is requesting. There is a movie theater in this stretch. There's no way a person can go in and see their movie and still be able to fall within the two hour time period.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think allowing us to go outside of the standard parking hours makes sense in this community. And I understand there's a parking structure. I think I just heard someone say that. But I think this is something that's important to the to the businesses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is something they've talked about and this is something they're requesting. And we could at least try it as a pilot. And if it doesn't work out, if it becomes too burdensome for the city, then we can go to the two hour.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are my thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And thank you guys for coming and speaking on this. I do know that the 3 hours conversation has been a conversation for the last year, back and forth and. I kind of struggled with the idea of wanting consistency across the board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I do think that this is the first time that we've had a bid this small decide to put meters there and that this is a request to make sure you can have dinner, go shopping and see a movie in 3 hours.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Makes sense to me. My the things that I would like to see is that it'd be extended to 3 hours that we add Sunday. I know the time that we talked about was nine or ten. I think it's a residential area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's 10:00 and is it 10:00 and in Belmont and everywhere else. So that would be I think if we went 3 hours, I would want to see us at ten instead of nine to make sure that residents can sleep in like me, who some days I don't have to go to work to 11.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those are the three changes that I would like to see. I respect staff's position on wanting it to be across the board. I think if we could reevaluate this in a year and look at how that has worked out, it would be ideal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I did have one question on the type of meters, are they going to be individual meters? Are they going to be one per ten spaces?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Pearce These will be single style meters, smart meters, similar to what we have in Belmont. Sure. So the programing aspect isn't really a challenge. I think as I mentioned, part of our review of the financial analysis and how much is this area going to generate financially to be able to pay off the capital investment took into'",
        "'speaker_2': 'consideration certain assumptions about turnover. And so certainly the three hour time limits change that turnover number. So I potentially anticipate that we may need to extend that repayment period for the capital investment, but that's something we can look at and monitor as as you suggest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you very much. So those are my changes. I need to make a formal there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you make that in the form a motion councilmember?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I would formally requested I hate doing these formal things to amend the motion to include extending it to 3 hours. Amend the motion to include Sundays for meter day. And that the start time for the program be 10 a.m..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know if that was in the thing or if it was nine. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': '10:00, right, counsel? Yeah. Okay. I think we're just that your second. Okay, great. So and again, I want to just again say I absolutely support this. I just want to understand the the three hour piece. So I appreciate the dialog, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was that was helpful. And Councilmember, I do think the idea of a pilot and checking how we're doing a year from now, I think is really smart. And that gives the ability of the of the association to the Business Improvement District to also evaluate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I want to thank you guys because not a lot of business districts voluntarily come forward and want to put in meters. And I think you guys get why it's good for the district and good for flow of traffic as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you guys for that. There is a motion in a second to for for the motion, please, to a roll call vote.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'And cafes want to do that. In addition to that, we're one of the few cities in California that does parklets out on our streets, and those are getting more and more popular. So to smooth that so people know exactly the path to get a parklet, the path to get outdoor dining.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mr. Beck and his team in public works have put together a booklet so that there's a clear path to follow to get those permissions. And I'll turn it over to Craig.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Manager. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the Council. Let's see here. We have a presentation that we wanted to share with you just to kind of detail some of the work that's been done and what's being proposed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're talking about both parklets and sidewalk dining. And essentially the city has been operating under a pilot program to allow these to go into our public right of way. As the city manager indicated, it really does provide a nice sense of neighborhood and community and has been a game changer for many of our business and entertainment'",
        "'speaker_2': 'corridors. Interestingly enough, we were here talking about fore street business corridor earlier. Our first parklet in the city actually happened on Fourth Street in front of Lola's in 2011. And you've seen kind of a number of them go in since.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we've really treated these as a case by case basis. So an applicant would come in, they would meet with city staff, they would have a conversation about what their goals were, what the sizing of the parklet would be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We worked with them to ensure that they were putting the right materials in the public right of way, and then all that would kind of culminate to come to council for action and direction on how to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it was a very labor intensive process and we wanted to take a look at how could we streamline that and make it easier for the applicants and honestly for the community to engage in the process. So our goals were really to standardize and simplify the approval process and also to develop a technical handbook, as the manager'",
        "'speaker_2': 'mentioned, to guide people along the way of of really what are elements that we would accept and what are elements that we wouldn't accept in? So those are our goals. This is there is a really robust document and I really would like to recognize the hard work by our planning team.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So development services planners were very involved in putting together our guidebook. And I think from the images that I'm sharing here, these are just some excerpts from the actual guidebook itself. But it's very user oriented. It's, it's, it's put together in a very cohesive way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it really helps people understand what the goals are of our particular program. So part of what we're here to propose this evening are a couple of things. One have to do with the uses and I'm sorry, I just want to see if there's another page here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. One has to do with the uses and when. You may recall that we had an item before council, I don't know, about eight or nine months ago to have a use on Pine Avenue that was outside of typical dining uses that we've approved in the past, and that was to provide for fitness activity out in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right of way. And at that time, the council directed staff to really evaluate what are the best uses for parklets and where would we land on recommendations and how should we utilize our public right of way, not only for parklets but also for sidewalk dining or other uses?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're really back to make a recommendation for you this evening that we keep that relatively narrow, that we would continue to support dining activities both in our sidewalk right of way and as a parklet that we would allow planting to occur.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if there was a desire to add some landscaping that complemented the business area, that those would be things that were supported. Certainly bicycle parking or maybe e-scooter parking would be one of those items if the council adopts a permanent E-SCOOTER program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also we believe that it's important to support public art and there may be opportunities where public art would be appropriate in a public right of way or parklet. That doesn't mean that we want to preclude those other uses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just believe that it's important that Council has an opportunity to weigh in on what those might be. So what we're essentially proposing tonight is that if something falls within, what we're saying would be a permitted use, that it would be a streamline permitting process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that streamlined, permanent permitting process would be provided at the staff level. So the value of this is that it can happen much quicker, A and B, that it would cost the applicants less money. So as you know, we base our fees on cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we were able to eliminate some steps in the process, the amount of staff time involved could also reduce the cost to the applicants. So part of what's being proposed tonight is just that. And it would allow folks to utilize the guidebook, bring forward their application in a streamline application process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It could be handled at the staff level and approved. If there was a desire to go with a non typical use, then we would go through a traditional process, evaluate that, bring that forward to council for consideration. There is another discussion as we went out to the different business improvement districts about the impacts to parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as you know, with this council, there are some community groups that are very concerned about parking, rightfully so. And as we kind of evolve as a community where parking is in great demand now, that may become less demand in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we just want to strike the right tone. So what we're recommending this evening is that we would cap the amount of parklets in a parking area at 20%. So we would believe it's appropriate, again, at a staff permitting level to allow up to 20% of the parking used to be converted into a parklet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If an application came in that went beyond that 20%, that would be an item that we would bring to Council for Council's full consideration. So again, we wouldn't preclude those parklets, but we want to have this body have an opportunity to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is essentially what we're proposing. So the benefits of these changes are that it strengthens the current program by being more informative, by utilizing the guidebook where we're much more transparent into what would be allowed in the right of way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It simplifies the process, as I mentioned, it does reduce costs to the applicants. It does address the design standards that we've collaboratively worked with, with our planning team. And I think it's ultimately a more efficient and effective collaborative process with the business community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that concludes my staff report, and I'm certainly available to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, thank you so much, Craig. I think this has been a policy many, many years in the making. And I just want to I'm just glad that we've gotten to this point. Thank you for your work in this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know Bill Pittman has also been behind the scenes, working very closely with a lot of our businesses to make sure they come to fruition and streamline the process. So it's wonderful to see that. I guess you sort of answered my question because this has been in the works.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I know this sort of came about because of Joe Ferrara from Groundwork Fitness that wanted to do a gym parklet, which is going very, very well. And I know along Pine Avenue we're even looking at like a bar for small dogs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've looked at how we're looking at a kid's parklet just different uses that could be a mix of something really creative along Pine Avenue. And so from what I'm understanding here is that aside from what we have there, like the bicycle, the art, it will have to come to council for review, which is great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At least there's a process there. Have we explored any have there been any other request in the meantime for Parklets that are sort of out of that scope at all?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not currently. The applications that we have are typically dining and so those there are a couple of dining permits that are pending, but I don't have any to my knowledge that are outside of what we're presenting tonight. And I think, Councilmember, that you did bring up a number of different uses and we recognize those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And actually at the staff level, I think we would support them. I think we found it challenging to try to list them all and it became this kind of exhaustive list. And so we thought that for the sake of simplification, it was easier to just designate a few uses in the guidebook and then tailor the guidebook to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'those uses and but yet still allow and certainly provide and support a path forward and just bring those kind of outside the normal use or whatever is normal, but outside kind of the standardized use to council and allow council to support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I agree that GEO Jim Parklet is fantastic and it really does a lot to activate the street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It really is great. And one last question. What is the fee? What what type of sort of permitting fee is associated with this parklet?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So currently the fee is 40 $800. We believe that will ultimately cut in half. I don't have that for you this evening, but I think that's where it will land. 24, 20 $500, most likely. We haven't actually gone through the streamlined process yet, so we're not 100% sure how much staff time is is involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's our our current belief is that it should cut in half.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. Well, thank you so much for. And thank you for getting us here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Council member Pier.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I also want to thank you for the work. I know that going through the Parklet process, each one is very different. Each one has a different staff, different ideas, different point people. So having had the socialists go through their experience with trying to add the parklet on the side, it gave me an appreciation for the work'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that you guys do and trying to get folks to follow a guideline. So I really am very excited about this. And when we unfortunately we used to have the toy shop on Broadway and one of the ideas we had was when we finished the Broadway project that we would have a like a toy corner that was a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'parklet there. But we will find another use for that parklet. Just want to thank you guys, the team and really appreciate this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Had a couple of just quick questions. I think there's a lot of great work that's going on going into this the staff report and the the. I like the idea of streamlining the process for particularly those business owners and business districts that want to activate the corridors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But in improving this, will we be basically approving giving up 20% parking in any business corridor?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the recommendation before council is that we would allow at a staff level for PARKLETS to be approved up to 20%. If there was a desire or an application came in beyond that, then those would come to council for review.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the item before us does more than just parklets though, right? I mean, it's for outdoor dining. So beyond parklets, I mean, if a business wanted to just create an outdoor patio. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thinking of Bixby Knolls, I think an example is we do have a couple sidewalk dining permits and Bixby knows that certainly isn't currently impacting any parking. I consider a parklet is something that's happening in the street right of way versus sidewalk dining, which is happening in the sidewalk right of way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we talk a lot about local control. I'm really the the blanket giving up 20% parking potentially is a concerning to me because not every business district not every corridor is created equally. And I'd like to at least have the discretion to to to work with my community to determine whether or not that is something that that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'would work. I mean, that I think that is a pretty big leap. And so I would ask for for an amendment, friendly amendment. And I don't know who I propose that to be, possibly the the maker of the motion here to to exempt that that particular piece of that or to give discretion to to to various communities'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just going to say that a bit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, it's a staff led item. So what? What would you suggest, Greg?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe I could just comment on that. I think, Councilmember, the staff struggled with that as well and trying to find what is that right balance. One of the things that we are requiring is support from the bid. If it is in a business district to move the parklet forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll give you an example. Right now, there are currently no Parklets in Belmont. Sure, there have been folks that have brought forward a desire to place a part parklet in Belmont Shore, but so far the bid and the parking commission have not been supportive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that is a different control point potentially. I'm certainly open if the council wants to lower that recommendation. Again, we were thinking about Fourth Street as an example where roughly a hundred parking spaces were created tonight. That will be part of the parking district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when you think about those spaces, what would be the appropriate number for Parklets? And we felt that 20 of those hundred would roughly be the right number. But again, I'm open to the council's direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'll have them in my motion and show some flexibility here. I would be be I think 10% would be good. But then beyond that, it would require a process that will come before the council. I will just just note that our our business improvement district do a great job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'None of our business improvement directors are elected by the residents that surround those business districts. And so when we talk about parking impacts, we're not quite there yet in some of my areas. But I can tell you the Long Beach Boulevard, you know, we want to do some things up in Virginia, Bay Village, Bixby Knolls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know there's some some request and ideas for for Parklets there as well. And I'm certainly open to that. But I want to I want to be be cautious that I don't jump ahead of myself and give away parking, that that is so preciously needed for all of our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so I wouldn't make a friendly amendment to the 10%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. We can do that? Or would would the language be relaxed to be able to say like contingent upon community? Input. I mean, what can you give us some direction here on? I mean, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So currently the proposal in front of council to consider is 20% of the available parking spaces. I think the better thing to do would be for council to come up with what that discretionary number would be. Because you remember we're essentially talking about a two step process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's going to be one that can happen at the staff level. So if you're telling me tonight that 10% is a more appropriate number, then I would be able to, at the staff level, approve permits up to 10% if a parklet came in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That took more than that 10%, then that's coming to council. So again, I think it's really where council feels comfortable at having a more streamlined and discretionary process with staff versus the items that you want us to bring forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm completely open to, to where this council lands. But. That may also impact the the fee structure that we ultimately end up with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yep, it's fine. I just wanted to get some input from our director, so thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so we're going to amend that to be 10% as a motion. I want to also give you a public comment here in just a minute. But what I just said, Mr. Beck, how many parklets do we have total across the city?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor, I knew you were going to ask me that question, and I wish I had the number I tried to to if you had the number don't have I believe it is 12, but I didn't get that number verified before then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. No, thank you then. They're fantastic. So the one thing I will say, I mentioned this before to Mr. West, and it's just something I think we just need to do a better job of is we have these 12 parklets all amazing, all different, all different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They look great. The architecture is fantastic. I think where we're behind is none of them are true public Parklets I believe all 12 of our parklets are essential extensions of a sidewalk experience, which is which is great, and we encourage those and we want more of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think if you go to most cities that are really progressive on on these types of uses and you are seeing public parklets that are open to the public where you don't have to actually purchase something. And so I would just encourage us that as we move forward, that we really look at locations where we could'",
        "'speaker_0': 'put in like, like councilwoman, like you mentioned, the public, the Parklet or a an area for for families to to relax or just pedestrian space so that people can enjoy the parklet. Because I do, I'm a little concerned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I every time we add a parklet. And don't add the public component. We are removing space and not adding to public space. And so I just my concern not I support this item, but I just don't want us to continue to approve or give more leeway to keep approving this these these these expansions while not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Giving the space back to the public in any bigger way. So if we can just make that note and I'd love to see us address this, I also how would and looking at this proposal, it certainly is geared towards a business or a restaurant wanting to come forward and propose a parklet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What about a public parklet? If an organization wanted to do that, it sounds like they can do that through this process as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. In May, I should point out something else which I didn't mention in my staff report. There is an annual renewal process that currently required under our PARKLET program, and we are recommending that that continues. We are going to streamline the annual renewal so we wouldn't require a full RESA medal, but there is a renewal process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if we do get to kind of a critical point and we feel that we need to take back some public space, we have that opportunity to cancel the actual permit and have the parklet removed. So that's try to address part of your first question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other part of your question, we have seen for the first time multiple business applications for a parklet that happened for Pine Avenue. So our last parklet that was put in was actually is actually there to support multiple and not just one business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think we are moving in that direction. I think that you've experienced and I agree you'll look when you look through the guidebook, there is some imagery from other cities where it's more of a public space with seating, etc. in in this permit process that we're proposing this evening, for example, in the downtown, the debate could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be an applicant on their own. It doesn't have to be for a business. They could propose a public space or a Berkeley or something like that. So it could come forward from a community organization and not necessarily just a business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I just want to reiterate, I know means I'm interested in removing anyone's permits or taking back all of these fantastic parklets as I love them and use them. I just think we have to. If the city does not make a focus effort on actually converting these into public spaces and not private spaces, I think'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we're doing ourselves in the public a disservice. And so I'd like to see an effort from public works in in getting public parklets built across the city. So any public comment? Seeing none. Rock roll call vote.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We have an opportunity tonight to address an incredible need, North Lawn Beach, and provide an opportunity to help our community college. The the motion before us tonight is to engage the necessary stakeholders in evaluating the short term and long term possibilities of expanding higher education uptown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As many of you know, the lobby City College has been experiencing a declining enrollment which negatively impacts their budget. According to a 2017 Long Beach labor market report, the 90805 zip code was identified as the area with the most potential increase enrollment and strengthen and strengthen the college's revenue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this was a study commissioned by Lobby City College. So here's a few facts on why. So number one north on beaches, the nature of its diversity. The ethnic ethnic makeup is predominantly people of color. And North Lombard is also very young.'",
        "'speaker_4': '50% of the population is under the age of 30 years old. Uptown, the median age is four years younger than the rest of the city and almost six years younger than the county. And looking at the numbers, North Long Beach has the most adults who can benefit from a community college.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are over 44,000 adults and the 90805 community with some college or less as their highest level of education. This includes adults who have completed some courses without obtaining a certificate, certification or degree. Adults who have completed high school, attended high school, obtained less than a high school education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that said, adults with these educational attainment levels and education and limited English language skills have the most potential to benefit from community college classes in basic skills, careers, technical education and courses such as English and a second language.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From an economic impact standpoint, community colleges confer more certificates than any other sector of higher education. As workforce programs help fill labor gaps, which is which fuels our local economy by 2020. And when now we're talking workforce readiness by 2020, 65% of all American jobs will require some form, some form of postsecondary degree or credential.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By 2025, California is projected to face a short shortage of workers with post-secondary education less than a bachelor's degree. And there are two employment projections, which will exclude many of our uptown residents from the workforce if we choose not to address our higher education ease now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here's the opportunity, because community colleges are the primary institution for our workforce development and an affordable pathway toward higher education. We want to ensure that distance is not a barrier. So it's been ten years in the since the inception of the college promise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we can all attest to the importance of aligning public institutions, the important that the impact has had on our community and on our education system. Establish establishing a North Miami education center will be no different, and timing is key.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With new development and construction projects happening on the Atlantic Avenue corridor, such as private retail that we know is coming out and part community center modernization improvements to the North Long Beach Health Department facility. The ongoing modernization of Jordan High School, North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it all of these things aligning tells us that it's it's time to explore additional potential partnerships on the private and the public side to help help with this this the improvements this corridor. And so by by collaborating with lobby City College Pacific Gateway and those who are excited about this could mean that the community could mean'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the community. I'd like us to explore identify both short term options which can be retrieved within a year. And I'd like us to identify a long term plan which is assessed, which assesses the sustainability, the ongoing sustainability of anchoring a higher education center in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so tonight, Lobby City College is considering a similar direction to partner with the City of Long Beach to explore feasibility. So I want to thank Lobby City College, particularly more specifically trustee input for this partnership on this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I want to thank the council members who signed on to this motion, Councilman Austin Pierce and U ranga as well. And I look forward to our conversation and moving forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much, Councilmember. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much. I was happy to sign on to this very innovative item. I want to thank our Councilmember Richardson for bringing it forward. And and I just want to be be clear that that, you know, I think our city is is actually known for its collaborative partnerships with our educational partners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long Beach Unified, as well as Long Beach City College and Cal State, Long Beach. You know, this is the the home of the college promise. And I think exploring opportunities to expand the community college experience is something that we should definitely support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was community college student, I'll just tell you. I think most people go to community colleges because they are convenient and where they go to community colleges that are most convenient for them to attend. And so when I was a community college student, I was it was close to my my place of employment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I could just walk across the street and and be at Long Beach City College. And it was a great experience. And so I think others should certainly have that opportunity. I just want to make sure that we're clear on who's leading this this this feasibility study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it Lumbee City College or is it the city of Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The question for me this so so the idea here it's a good opportunity. The hope here is that we're going to assign dedicate some staff is excited to work work on this on our site and they put some folks on their site because there's two different things need be evaluated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they're going to do some internal sort of evaluation and we're going to look at some of the opportunities with some of our public public investments as well as some of the private retail. So released two focuses and the hope will be some sort of a joint task force that that sort of explores this feasibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'm happy to support Long Beach, Long Beach City College's efforts to expand their their their footprint in the city of Long Beach. I think they definitely have a footprint in the east side of Long Beach and I would say the other east side of Long Beach in the central area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so northern beaches, if they can do that and expand that model is something I certainly support also would just just make make suggestions that, you know, since we do have a college promise that we engage other educational institutions in this as well, like Columbus Unified because, uh, well, I'll just, just say this, that they are brick'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and mortar public institutions that are already in existence that may require just a joint partnership agreement to, to, to make things happen. And so and to to increase access for for folks in North Long Beach. I think there's a whole I don't I don't think we should have to limit our scope.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should look at all possibilities. And so happy to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council Member Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, I am also was really excited to see this. Also as a community college student, I went to three community colleges before I graduated at Cal State Long Beach, so definitely making sure they're accessible. They often have classes that are different times than a university and so having access to them is critical.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think our partnership with the community college, I know that often we talk about partnership and that sometimes it's, you know, we support each other. But actually being at the table together with skin in the game on both sides is where we're going to see the most change for our community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I was happy to sign on to this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Supernova. Thank you. I just have a comment or a question on one part of the report here. A sentence caught my eye that says the average bus commute from Jordan High School to Albuquerque campuses. Our campus takes 2 hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The fact if it takes 2 hours to go 5.6 miles. Maybe that's a different problem that we can address along with this report, because that seems.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Outrageous to think you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely so. I mean, in the conversations, there's a lot of benefits. I would just say transportation access is going to be a part of that, hopefully will be a part of that ongoing discussion. And there and we were, you know, we think there is opportunities for other agencies, not just lobbies unified, but, you know, the number one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the number one matriculation campus for Jordan High School for Community College happens to be Compton College. Number two is Cerritos College. Number three is Lobby City College. Right. And so we come third in terms of matriculation for law for these students.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think this conversation, once it begins, we're going to find how many different opportunities there are for higher education. And there's also, since it became public, Cal State Dominguez Hills reached out and said, hey, we consider North Palm Beach in our service area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think it's a huge opportunity for us to really just talk about the point of higher education. North Palm Beach. But thank you, Councilman Rubino.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor Roberto, go here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I'd like to also chime in. Being a former communications trustee. I think that any opportunity that we have to expand the footprint of the Green College within the language community is wonderful. I want to thank, of course, the Cosmo Rich to bringing this forward and to working with our community college trustee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would like intact from City College in bringing this forward. It would be my expectation and hope that we look at like a satellite campus. I think that is what we're going towards, that we would also include areas such as West Palm Beach, which has the the same basically demographic in regard to being away and not not a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'center for people to go to get to go get an education there as well. The real high school is there. Many of our career high school students go to City College, but the commute is can be quite extensive going to our PCC campus or to the east campus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So having one in our town, it would provide an excellent opportunity for choices in where to choose to continue education. But at the same time, I'm hoping that whatever comes out of this feasibility study that we look at the types of programs and the kinds of educational opportunities and options that might be available for students who want'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to enroll in a in a satellite like campus. So I would look I look forward to working with that. I look forward to that cooperation in coordination with our Albuquerque counterparts, as well as working with the Long Beach State to get their ideas on what would be a real good program that would provide unique and successful opportunities'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for students to participate in these colleges. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Let me go to public comment now. Please come forward.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I am here half an hour past bedtime. That's how important this is to me. Higher education is the cornerstone for everything. At the Latino Economic Summit that I attended earlier today, I think it was clear that educational opportunities for all of our residents and that doesn't just mean a four year college.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Or even an associate's degree, but some sort of post-secondary education is really going to make a difference in the future success of Long Beach when we ensure success for Long Beach residents, particularly in north Long Beach and West Long Beach, where we see less economic development and investment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a North Long Beach resident, I'm very excited about the things that are coming along the Atlantic corridor, the Artesia corridor. I see this is really good timing because when you bring in college students, when you bring in the additional economic benefit of any sort of satellite campus, I mean, I love that this is not being pigeonholed'",
        "'speaker_8': 'into one type of thing, but we're really open to whatever best serves my new community. People are going to want to eat. They're going to want to go to a bank. They're going to want to shop, they're going to want to go places.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we already have that peace in motion. So this feels like really good timing. I would also like to just take a moment as a board member for Long Beach Transit, a city commissioner, to address the issue, we recently conducted a very comprehensive star initiative is what we called it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was basically a complete system review and there is a lot of room for redoing our routes, our systems, our timings. Of course, all of that takes money like everything. And so I would just say that while I have personally talked with our CEO or our deputy CEO who are really engaged and really concerned about equity, about'",
        "'speaker_8': 'getting people the places they need to be. And this review came after, I think it's been 12 years since the last one. And so people are different places. People have congregated in different places and need to get different places than perhaps they did 12 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is something that Long Beach Transit has really taken as a top priority for us. And so I hope that that is something we can say we're addressing very soon. There were many, many different things that came out of that study as recommendations and so service to North Long Beach and West Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Very good. You Clercq has to address the need for improvements in that across the board in the ninth district. So obviously they need now they need not be discussed. I think that this approval and complete aid is the resignation of council in Austin and Richardson.'",

But more disturbing is their championing of the individual Snoop Dogg. With his deviant position relative to how women should be treated.'",

The audience will consolidate the existing regulations that affect hospitality locations in the city. It will codify the best practices from other jurisdictions that staff identified and piloted and establish an intercontinental action team to implement and monitor'",
        "'speaker_2': 'compliance of the ordinance regulations and identify development services as the lead agencies. Lead agencies for the Action Team Coordination and Ordinance Compliance Excellence. In addition to the recommended ordinance, staff pursuant to counsel's direction, have researched additional policies and programs to address nuisance motels, focusing in particular to a longer range solution that can come back the structural factors'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that lead to nuisance and criminal activity. These include motel conversions, zoning regulations, amortization and motel acquisition for motel conversion staff research the interim model excuse me, motel conversion ordinance from the city of Los Angeles, which allows for a ministerial approval process of temporary conversions to supportive housing that can be scaled on a citywide basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A similar program in Long Beach could allow for applicable motels to be converted to permanent supportive housing on a temporary basis. Staff also researched, and this type of ordinance, coincidentally, could be something that we could develop by second quarter of next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff also researched zoning regulations to discontinue motel uses in certain parts of the city, most notably the plan in North Long Beach could be that could designate motel uses as legally non-conforming use as meaning that they would no longer be allowed to operate after a certain period of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This could be a more immediate step that would also serve as a precursor to additional regulations. As the Council is aware, the the plan is now moving forward and should be completed by the fourth quarter of next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An additional tool that staff considered is the amortization or the phasing out of motel users. As most of you know, the amortization would terminate motel uses completely within a given period of time. That period of time is typically assessed through a study that allows the either businesses or the property owners to be whole of their investment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In order for us to move forward, we would need to identify revenue resources to be able to prepare the study and that direction would be needed from the council. An additional program that is essentially on a case by case basis is the acquisition of motels in order for this resource to be moved forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, we would need revenue resources as well as the opportunity for vacancies or opportunities to purchase motels. This would allow the city the flexibility to redevelop the motels to either a supportive or additional housing or other commercial ventures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In conclusion, staff recommends that the City Council request the city attorney to prepare an ordinance to establish nuisance and motel program. This concludes staff's presentation, and we look forward to answering any questions that you may have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? Look what you can learn about this world. Excuse me. We'll go behind the guy's house first. Comes from noticing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. So so first I want to thank the entire team, the multi departmental team that worked on this pilot. This was in response to a call from the community to find some short term and long term solutions, specifically for the Long Beach Boulevard corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that widened in the pilot was extended to, you know, six, six motels citywide. And I think the fact that we can and we've all watched this process, you know, in fact, just raise your hand if you've been following this process from the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's a number of people who've been, you know, following this process to come back and say that we looked at the control group and then the pilot group, and they've seen a 30 plus percent drop in calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that shows that give this additional attention. Attention has been working. And so I'm glad that we use the data to demonstrate the results of this pilot. And so I'm supportive of moving forward on the recommended recommendation to move forward with an actual ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I like the I like the approach that we did a pilot. We evaluated the pilot. And then we move forward with creating the law. This is the same approach that we did with the Alcohol Nuisance Abatement Ordinance, and that's been a success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, it's been recognized as a as a best practice. And I like that we took that approach here. So I support that. And I'm going then within my motion request, I'm so concurring support for establishing this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The second thing I want to pull out is the mention of, you know, beginning the conversation on streamlining the motel conversion process and creating that ordinance similar to Los Angeles. And Oscar, you mentioned that this could be possible, possibly done in Q2 of 2018.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to include in my motion to move forward on on that process based on the timeline that you presented, the Q two for the conversion, I think that makes sense, gives us enough time to move forward and work for next few months on this ordinance before moving on to next.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then additionally, we mentioned both the, the, the zoning approaches with a plan. I'm very comfortable with that. That's beginning the long term conversation. And we said we want to be very clear about short term, immediate solutions, but also addressing the long term problem that there's, you know, a concentration on this one corridor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we need to talk about what the core of the vision for the corridor in the future. And I think that is appropriate in the land use document. So thank you for that. But the other the last thing that stood out was the fact that in order to pursue amortization is going to require additional study beyond the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'capacity that what we have. And so I would ask that we don't leave it there, that we do forwarded to city staff into the Budget Oversight Committee to think about this, because we looked at amortization as a solution citywide, not just for North Long Beach, but when you have outdated out, you know, when you have corridors with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'multiple motels, you know, Long Beach Boulevard, for example, as motels were in place before the 17 freeway had very different use. And, you know, the land use didn't keep up when the 710 was built. And so now you have these outdated land uses that we may need a tool like amortization to address.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the same is, you know, the case on other corridors like, you know, PCH or Anaheim, you know, some of the other corridors where these motels were. So I'm going to add the third thing here is to refer to the Budget Oversight Committee and to to and city manager to evaluate potential funding solutions in the next fiscal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'year's budget if available. So again, this is this is amazing work. I'm very proud of this work. We're going to be talking about this with with the Long Beach Boulevard community very soon. And many of them are here to follow this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think this is a good, important step and we've made some incredible progress. Thanks a lot.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Councilman Richardson. Councilwoman Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Yes. I want to thank Scott for their work on this. I think the numbers on some of the graphs are are very telling. On Councilmember Richardson's third note around the acquisitions, where we get funding for I know that we've amortization.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just looked at acquisitions because it was in front of me. Thank you. The idea of getting these motels into being some housing solutions, I know that we've talked a lot about villages of Cabrillo, and I wanted to ask staff if they've had any conversations with them in regards to this motel item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I've had a couple conversation. We can talk offline, but they basically have been building up funds to be able to go out and purchase properties like this. So yes, we as a city need to identify funds that we can use.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think there are some entities in the city that are willing to step in immediately, that they're actually out there scouting properties right now, that if we had a motel that fell into one of these categories might not be on our we might not need to spend our taxpayer money to do that, but we could rely'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on some of our community partners to do that. But I definitely think that this has been a great model. I think had some questions on what's the pilot program? What exactly did you guys do to get some of these numbers down all the way?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It says that you guys monitored, but maybe I missed it. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the pilot program consisted of, again, multiple disciplines from throughout the city, meeting with the property owners on a regular basis, identifying potential improvements to the way either in security and signing and their operational characteristics that would allow them to reduce their calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we would meet with them on a regular basis to to check to make sure that those items were implemented. It's a menu list, if you will, a compliance plan, a list of items customized to each hotel. And those items would actually help improve the way they operate their business and hence reduce the calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you for that. And just refresh my memory. I know that when the Human Trafficking Task Force started some of their work here in the city, that some of that had to do with signage in hotels. Did that include these motels as well?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was staff from the health department that went on site visits and spoke with motel managers and owners regarding human trafficking and putting up signage. That's more of a recommendation, but it's something that we're looking to integrate more fully as a compliance plan looks forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. Fully support this. Think it's great work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Yes. Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you so much and great work to staff. I'm glad we as Councilmember Richardson said, I'm glad we started with the pilot and now we're moving towards an ordinance. And the first, we personally have lots of unfortunate motels along PCH, a few off Alamitos and Seventh Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm looking forward to seeing how those sort of interplay with with the ordinance and where we can get some some progress on those PCH. And it has been a major issue. It actually has deterred businesses from receiving ABC licenses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The businesses are really good standing, but the crime and areas around it, because the motels are such, you know, for poor behavior has really deter them from getting licenses, unfortunately. So just something to put out there. But relative to the presentation you had mentioned 15 locations, six of them that were piloted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What were the other locations and do we have? Addresses on them. I had to look up the locations you had in the presentation just online. But what were the other locations? Do you have just that information?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So the other nine locations from the original study were the Grace Hotel, the Slumber Inn Motel, the Palms Motel, the Liberty Motel, the Belmont Sure Inn Motel, the Rocky Inn Motel, the Inn of Long Beach, the All eight motel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the Royal Inn Motel.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, very fancy names, right? Royal and luxury. I love it. Nothing. But if we can get that list. I don't know if it was in the. I didn't. Oh, was it in the original presentation? Okay, great. Then I'll go ahead and look at that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's great. As far as an enforcement mechanism, I know the ordinance. I know there's an action team that will be put in place. But is there any other sort of enforcement mechanism? I know in the past we've done, you know, calls for service that could be charged to the owner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What other sort of enforcement mechanisms are we exploring?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So some of the the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mechanisms that have been research are related to citations, charges for police activity and increased calls for service levels. And some of the compliance measures are actually already within the municipal code. So this would kind of centralize them and make motel managers and owners aware of everything that they already have to comply with and then any additional regulations'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that would come down the pipeline as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These and these items would be subject to citation as well as city prosecutor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. Another two questions. So outreach about the program. So once the ordinance comes into play, I would love for us to I want all of the motels to know that this ordinance is alive and good so they could hopefully change their practices.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What are we thinking about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the idea is, is to establish a marketing campaign once the council approves the ordinance and and be able to communicate that to all the the hospitality establishments, especially those that are near or over the thresholds for calls for service and to again, solicit input from the community as well as the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hoteliers should be able to discuss the compliance plan and move that forward before we begin the compliance planning efforts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. And last question and I had this question before when we had the conversation about bad actor landlords, about future projects. I know a lot of these property owners, they may come to Planning Commission and they have a brand new project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And oftentimes we as council members or planning commissioners don't know that they have a problem with Project A, but now they have a brand new project that they want to build or they just think there's got to be something that we as a council body should know of, that they have issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sometimes we don't. We often don't know about that unless we dig into the details and research that. But I'm just wondering if there's anything that could be flagged for us knowing that, you know, they may want to own multiple properties or have, you know, another copy or another permit of some sort, and that we at least know'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that before going into a decision and making a decision on a new property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's actually one of the first research efforts that we undertook as this will be housed primarily within development services. We fortunately have the greatest amount of access to property ownership information. We're looking to include that in some way and mitigate any issue there on back end data gathering to make sure that we understand the full context'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of of these sites, that property owners and property managers that may be related to other sites or to other nuisance issues throughout the city are included within whatever efforts that we have going forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. I think thank you very much for that and great work again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just wanted to clarify, the funding that we talked about was the 150 K referenced in here as a need to evaluate the amortization piece. Just just to be clear, between that and funding for conversion. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Did you have a chance to do public commentary on this? Any public comment on this case? None. So there is a motion at a second on the floor. Please call the roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Supernova. All right. Councilwoman Mongo I. Vice Mayor Andrews. So for me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson.'",

That measure is more restrictive and applies by its definition to hotels or as they define hotels in that initiative of 50 rooms or more. So all of the provisions of that initiative will go into effect pursuant to the election code after the county certifies and it'",
        "'speaker_11': 'comes to the city council and it's certified by the City Council ten days after that certification. WW will go into effect. So the impact on this ordinance that's before you this evening then would be this ordinance would apply in essence to hotels as defined in this ordinance of 49 rooms or less.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it will also be changed. This ordinance has a an application period or it applies to rooms of 50 or more. Immediately that will be trumped and overruled by measure. WW. So in essence, this would apply to the 49 rooms or less, and they would have up to one year to come into compliance with this ordinance.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Right? That's what I mean. So this ordinance would augment that public safety piece and apply to a broader group.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I hope that we don't have to have a long part of a discussion. But I did want to highlight that there were three different things that were really important to me someone who values writing good policy, who's been a director at a public policy organization for a decade.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And these three things were that it did not include contract employees, that the issue that's in front of us tonight does not include a retaliation clause as it is read in measure. WW And that the retaliation part as well as the notification parts are not included.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's my understanding that if we included those tonight that there would need to be a would have to start the clock over again. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is correct. If we amended it with those provisions, as you've just outlined, it would come back. We would need to rewrite it and it would come back for first reading.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And I do I think that, you know, there's a lot of conversation around all of the items and. WW And so I feel confident that constituents and myself feel that these are really important. I know that my colleague, Councilmember Price, and I have had a couple of conversations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I wanted to ask you if we passed this tonight and came back and I believe it's 31 days with amendments, including all of these. Is that something that you're okay with?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, I would be more than happy to consider any amendments. And I think having a no retaliation clause and applying it to all employees, whether they're contract or not, is totally reasonable. So I'd be I'd look forward to seeing the language of any proposed amendment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I really do want to close the chapter on this ordinance tonight. And as with any of our ordinances and our muni codes, we can amend them at any time to make them better, more robust, whatever we'd like to do.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'have a panic button, you're not scared to use it for fear of retaliation. So it's great to hear you say that you support those two items which are near and dear to me. I want to hear from my council colleagues before I take a vote on this item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So two things. One, we just had a conversation about a motel ordinance that we're going to be crafting, and I'm sure there's going to be some outreach. And then this this ordinance going to pass tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are there any opportunities to save some money and just have one outreach process that goes to, you know, all because we're talking, frankly, to all the motels about safety, really, that's the common denominator of safety. So can we have one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it possible to have one safety conversation as we go out and do outreach with city manager or development services? We just make a mayor councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We can certainly do that, although these are kind of two separate items. So one would definitely be the ordinance that we just passed or that that you're dealing with right now. But I think we'd like to make sure they're on parallel passed, but we can certainly talk to folks at the same time when we're talking to them'",
        "'speaker_11': '. I don't know what's going to be first when we get out there and talk to the the motels. But we can certainly do that. But I think ultimately we're going to probably do parallel paths to get the message across on both items.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Because I think there's value. There's value if we're going to engage because some of them are difficult to track down and find some of these these motel owners, these operators, the small folks. I think it makes sense while we're there and we have their captive audience, if the city is going to require panic buttons for them'",
        "'speaker_4': 'while we're additionally requiring lighting or whatever is going to happen this new ordinance, I just think it makes sense for them to understand that all of these are important to the city, not, you know, one and then the other, and especially if we're talking each other the same way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That makes sense. Okay. Just wanted to make sure this wasn't way out of left field here and then and then the second part is just picking up the conversation. Councilwoman Pryce and Councilwoman Pearce, I'm you know, frankly, with the election behind us, I am looking forward to moving forward with one ordinance that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it does make sense. I understand that folks want to move forward tonight. I get that. But what I'm unclear on those three things that you mentioned. And so one of them was, you know, if you're an employee, clean the housekeeper.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you're a housekeeper cleaning the room, whether you're, you know, paid for directly as an employee or you're a contractor brought in, the truth is just the same. You're going into a room with the same scenario. And so it sounded like there was consensus in your motion to ask staff to come back with these amendments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And 30 days we look at that when I understand that I would like to there is a there is a way here to adopt the ordinance and give staff direction to come back with it written out so we can evaluate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, I actually don't believe legally that that's an option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I, I agree. I think that tonight either your action tonight is either approve the second reading or tell me to change it however you'd like to change it. And we would come back and would come back for first reading.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think what I heard the councilmember from the second district say is, which I think is correct, is that this ordinance within 31 days after it's approved by the mayor would become effective at any point thereafter. You could amend it that day or bring back direct city attorney to amend with A, B and C or D, whatever'",
        "'speaker_11': 'it is you'd like to change. And we could do it at that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the 31 days was after it signed, after it's voted on. Tonight, it goes into effect after.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You could amend it any time after it goes into effect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So any day after 31 days. So I guess my question would be, can we just give some direction and say bring that, you know, adopt the ordinance and then a separate motion in addition that says no, now we're post WW, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're post WW. There's an interest here in seeing some of those clarifications come back after it's fully implemented. So is there is there a way we can give directions? They make sure that this comes back after a month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that kind of brings people together saying both.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think the answer to that is no. I think you what? You either are going to approve an ordinance or are you going to tell me to amend it tonight? You can't do both.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Good to see you, Tony. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now some our.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Price.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just wanted to say, I think once we approve it tonight and I know you know this, Councilman Richardson, so I'm not trying to like preach or anything. I'm just saying procedurally, I think what will happen is if we want to have an amendment, we'd bring a separate agenda item asking the city attorney to change the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ordinance to include this or that. We've done it for a couple of our existing ordinances already that maybe needed some fine tuning in the language so we can make it better or broaden it or whatever we want to do after it's approved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then we can give them direction at that point through a separate agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if I may, Councilmember Richardson brought up the point of the employee on the contract. I think in our ordinance, we do cover both the employee and a contract employee who's cleaning. I think where we have a difference with WW is how we define a hotel employer, and that's not including the contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I if I understood the councilman from the second District correctly, that is something she would like to add to include that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So to be just to clarify on timeline, I think we all want to kind of put the heartache and the pain of this behind us. I really would like to to be able to to vote to support this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think to trust that the council is there and that so that's kind of the process part. So. We have 31 days after the mayor signs it, then we can bring back the ordinance. We can't bring it back sooner than the mayor signs it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I think you could bring back an action agenda. Is it at the next meeting or whenever after the mayor signs it? We would probably bring it back after the effective date to amend that ordinance. We don't have an effective ordinance to amend until that time, but you could next week put something on to say we want'",

So while it would be 31 days and maybe three months until we finally have a final change with the amendments, that's not to say that in those next three months, you guys are already going'",

The ordinance allows these hotels that will fall under this ordinance up to 12 months to come into compliance if there's something that's placed on the agenda immediately or shortly hereafter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We would wait because we don't know what the council's going to do if you're going to be changing or before we start sending out some sort of notices to the employer, we don't want send mixed messages to the hotels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we would probably wait. And something else you could consider if you are going to amend it is to extend that period out. And it would you would start the 12 month clock again or you could change that, you know, period of time.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'From what I'm hearing now is that if we were to adopt this ordinance, it would take us that much longer to reach a middle ground that would be acceptable to everybody. I don't see that happening. I think that this ordinance still has issues we still need to work on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any of that is in fact what we want to do with the passage of WW. I think we have a good ordinance there that we can abide by. While it might be a good thing for the this this ordinance to pass to deal with the hotel, hoteliers that are 49 rooms and under is still not it's not'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. And I appreciate Councilman Randy's comments. I do want to take a moment to thank and appreciate the work of Linda Vu, the attorney who helped draft this ordinance. I completely disagree with Councilman Arango regarding whether it was poorly or properly drafted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think it was drafted very well. And ironically, much of the language was exactly the same as WW. So a big thanks to the city attorney's office for ensuring that there was consistency and synergy on the public policy piece.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to make sure that our city staff gets the recognition they deserve for doing the work that we've asked them to do, even if we don't agree with the premise of what they were asked to do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. I do have a broader question, Mr. City Attorney. Maybe this is to the city manager. It's just more of a compliance question. I know that, you know, regardless of the outcome tonight and if this passes and then the broader question about all the hotels, including the smaller ones, is do we have a strategy on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the compliance side? I think there is some compliance language in the law in the broader WW language. And can you just speak to that? I've had some questions about that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Maybe the WWE does have a self help, basically section and enforcement mechanism. This would be fall under city staff through code enforcement and business license to enforce the provisions of this if there are violations by the hotels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we can do that through administrative lines, through citations. And so that's how this ordinance would be affected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But as far as WWE is concerned, though, isn't there also a compliance piece that the the city is responsible for in the larger measure, or am I wrong?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Currently there is is not. It does allow the city to consider adopting rules and regulations to if necessary. That's one thing after the implementation. If if, you know, we get down the road and have some experience with this and we believe that there's additional measures that the city needs to take to make sure that the hotels are'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. So I just want to be clear as well that we will move this if this should pass and move forward, then if there is interest in create. So we. So basically we would have to create another agenda item versus just making the amendment tonight, but yet we would still be on the same timeline.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The timeline would slip a little bit, right. Because if if it passes this evening, the process of it becoming effective begins in the 31 days. Clock would begin probably tomorrow. The if there's another agenda item to now modify what is adopted this evening, we would make those changes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It would come back for a first reading, a second reading on the amendment, and then the 31 days would start. So I don't have a calendar in front of me, but if we depending on when this proposed amendments come, if there's a three identified, they'd be pretty quick too for us to be able to return that back'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And I know I can't predict the future. On what would happen if we move forward with another agenda item. But I just think that to have amendments now seems like it would be a little bit more expedient versus waiting for an agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hopefully it passes and then waiting some more time to get that implementation done. So I just wanted to be clear on that. Okay. Thank you very much. I too think that although we had a city staff member who generously provided language for this item, we appreciate that certainly very much.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just just one additional thing. So I think and I liked that the conversation got really narrowed to just what's the difference between, you know, this and WW and what I'd like to see. So we move forward with this ordinance tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what I actually see is just a very brief to form for that just outlines the differently the to to help support the crafting of what the amendments are. Because really we're talking about two or three very narrow changes that make that aligns it with.'",
