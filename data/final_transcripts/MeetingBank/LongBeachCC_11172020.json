        "'speaker_5': 'zoning code. It also involves the adoption of 12 new zoning tools, specifically that implement three place types within the journal that were established by the general plan. I'll go into that in more detail. The 12 zones are comprised of six primary citywide zones and six series zones, which are tailored to the north Long Beach area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then finally, the rezoning of properties on Artesian Atlantic to one of the six new acreage zones. This diagram just briefly just illustrates the relationship between the general plan and the new zones. So the city, of course, has a general plan in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The land use element was updated and the City Council adopted an urban design element. The land use element established 14 place types. The zoning code implements the general plan. However, the current zoning code is does not have the range of tools that are necessary to implement the new general plan, taste type, place types.'",

The first phase is indicated by the orange on the map here, the two corridors that we've been discussing, the phase two, all that is currently in process and is expected to wrap up'",
        "'speaker_5': 'next year. It will address zoning and other considerations in the rest of the area on this map. This is just a timeline that kind of really is intended to communicate the level and extent of outreach that was done for this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This project has had extensive outreach in the form of advisory committee meetings, workshops. Work audits, demonstration projects. The next couple of slides, kind of give more detail on the timeline. I'm not going to go into that in there in a lot of detail, but just highlight some of the more near term milestones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The zoning districts, the zoning code, draft zoning code that is before the council was first released to the public in May of last year, and it went to the Planning Commission in November, sorry, in June, and is now here before the City Council in November.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is just a division statement that was developed in conjunction with the community, with the community. A number of technical studies were prepared in order to inform the zoning recommendations, including an extensive parking parking study and feasibility testing of different development standards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This slide shows the map of the general plan place types that were adopted as part of the land use element. And you can see the three different place types represented on these corridors and the heights that are permitted per the general plan, which range vary between three and four stories.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the next slide, this is the zoning map itself and you can see how those place types were translated into these zones. The two kind of orange colored zone zones represent primarily residential but mixed use zones that also allow commercial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The three blue shades of blue represent different mixed use zones that allow both commercial, residential and combinations thereof at various types of uses and intensities. And the the pink indicates the area that is zoned for solely commercial use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So no residential is allowed there. To characterize the nature of these zone changes. These are limited to the corridors and involve minimal single family. They implement changes are already established in the general plan in terms of allowable uses and heights.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The new zones limit new uses of certain types that are concentrated in the area, that are existing uses, are grandfathered in and are permitted to remain. The expanded use is allowed by these zones. Zoning tools are designed to encourage housing and a wider range of commercial uses to address existing needs for housing, services and jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The next few slides I'll try to go through very quickly. Just summarize the rezoning recommendations. In general, the uses are broader use categories that allow flexibility for new and evolving businesses. The use regulations support desired uses in the in the neighborhoods such as grocery stores and institutional educational uses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it generally expands allowances for mixed use and residential development in areas that previously would only allow commercial. In terms of land use. There's incentives for, as I noted, desirable uses that were expressed as desirable uses by the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it places limitations on new uses that are concentrated in the area, such as motels, drive thrus, off site, alcohol and the like. Okay. So development standards, generally speaking, the new zones are form based and design oriented. They encourage buildings that are oriented to the street and that activate street frontages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are new tailored open space regulations that scale with the size of the lots. In response to the shallow ness of some lots on commercial corridors and other physical site constraints. Okay. All right. I'm having trouble advancing the slide here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let's see. Almost done. Okay. There we go. Parking in general has been modified to standardize requirements across a wide range of commercial. Commercial uses to facilitate building re-use and parking reductions are used as an incentive. So this find that this slide is just a recap that reminds the council and mayor of the different components of this project'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And that includes, I think, that our civil deputy director wants to kind of summarize here in the slide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. Thank you, Petra. So so tonight is very much about Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson and these changes to their district. But I just wanted to place into context what this means for land use in the city and the tools that we're developing.'",

So the parking issue that we're addressing in this area is not totally dissimilar from the parking district that you find in Belmarsh or in Naples, in Councilmember Price's district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not that different from area south of here, south of the project area and in Bixby Knolls and in areas throughout the city. What's also similar is this is about context sensitive new development. This is about what is new development look like that's less dense, less intense than what you find downtown, but still brings new housing into'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our city and still transforms our commercial corridors, you know, whether they're in central Long Beach, north Long Beach or elsewhere. And it's really about being able to have a framework and then customize for every single neighborhood. So here you have a series of zones which address issues in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at some point in the future, when we're addressing land use in central Long Beach or coastal Long Beach, we could have that same level of customization with whatever the community desires are in that particular location.

        "'speaker_3': 'I have never received an invitation to a first outreach session on this. The staff report is 325 pages long. I believe this is a complex topic. It is of interest to residents. It may be a great plan, but we haven't had the opportunity to learn about it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you purchase a piece of real estate, you purchase the zoning. It is a key facet of a property description. Changing the zoning definitions is a major move. You're affecting each homeowner's personal real estate investment. It has been said that the American dream is to have a home with a front yard backyard and a white picket fence'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And while I acknowledge there are other choices and opportunities out there, the group, the Work Picket Fence Group, is normally concerned with density. I'm told the new zoning document has made changes such as defining, set back or now the amount of setback required as measured from the sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the future it will be measured from the street. What we'd like to have is the opportunities that the ninth district has. We would like to have the opportunity to understand the proposed building changes before there are certain.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. Hello, this is Paul Babcock. I'm a resident of the fifth District, and I also provide, uh, housing in the third district. I'm very concerned about this, uh, measure and that there's been no participation from the third or the fifth District residents.'",

And we also don't want this density to pervade in the fourth District, and we'd like to have that taken into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'consideration. And lastly, remove the language that applies to the the whole city and give an opportunity for neighborhood outreach and discussion and understanding of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Governor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and I certainly appreciate the comments that folks have given out. I support this. This project was planned. I will start with based on these these comments, that this is a phased in approach. We began this process well before the Louie process conducted with the focus on North Long Beach, really addressing some longstanding issues'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and setting a vision for the next 30 years that pull away from motels, liquor stores and move toward healthy food and things like that. And it became a great opportunity to test out new zoning that's really creative, innovative, some and the things that they've achieved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But as a phased in approach, that means we're starting here. But if there's any additional zoning takes place in other areas of town. They'll have to go through their own planning and outreach process. So this is not affecting anything in the fifth District of the third District.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we are really excited for what it does here in the ninth District. A few more reasons why I'm excited for it is that it's anywhere or it is only north. Bobby It limits the liquor store, something that I focused on, something that our predecessors focused on, something that Councilman Alston is focused on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eliminate it. Make it more difficult to prioritize drive thrus and motels and automotive uses. But it's now prioritized healthy food options and housing and sit down restaurants, grocery store, the medical institution, institutional uses like a new beach city college.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It also encourages safe pedestrian activity that incentivizes local employment through some really innovative steps and features. It incentivizes features that minimize future greenhouse gas emissions, such as tree planting and cool roofs and solar installations and bike infrastructure. So we're really we're really proud of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One thing I do want to mention is that there's a lot of innovation in this plant. And one issue that's really been an issue for us is the overabundance of overconcentration of off sale liquor, liquor stores. And what this does is it moves away from the formulaic, you know, entities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, looking at how many you have in a census tract to determine whether it's appropriate and moves to something that's more contextual and emphasizes mixed use and good design principles and things like that. So we're making decisions around around liquor that prioritizes, you know, establishing sit down restaurants as opposed to more liquor stores in North Lombard'",
        "'speaker_1': '. It's it's as you mentioned, it's designed to address housing issues is incredibly important. And at the same time, it's incentivizing things that we mean fitness uses, medical uses, things like that. One thing I do want to acknowledge is together, put together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We just adopted we just voted on the design of Radar Boulevard front. That's incredibly important because that is the public right of your medians, your lighting, your pedestrian environment, your bikes and all of these things. Your signal. And then this updates the zoning priorities of Boulevard and Atlantic Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So together, comprehensively, it's just that a new sort of a comprehensive new vision, RTG Boulevard, a public right away and the private the private side of the house. So that's incredibly important. I want to thank all the staff has worked on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Christopher Koch remembers our first conversations. My first term, when we talked about doing some sort of a masterplan. He partnered with us to go to tag Early Service President's Gang for that. And I was a regional council member and I put forward $250,000 based on the initial work that we did in-house with Alisyn and Christopher with the'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I see this this item, this plan is an important step and milestone for implementing a new vision for North Long Beach. We have worked for several years to get to this point. The planning process started as in early 2018.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has involved a number of community meetings, visioning exercises and different community events, including walk audits that I've participated in with the community, with community members along the corridors in a demonstrated demonstration project that actually happened in the North Village on Atlantic Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so to the point that it hasn't been a community input. These were all public meetings. They were well advertised, and we encouraged a lot of public participation in this process. The I believe that the zoning changes and recommended zoning changes before us, and this document will help the Atlantic Corridor, as well as the Artesia Corridor, facilitate'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the new development that will help us realize this vision. It's so important for our economic development, but our housing needs, as well as many of the points raised by Councilmember Rich, said that, you know, there is a vision, there's a clear direction in terms of where we are going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It looks like mixed use is going to be in our future, particularly along these corridors in North Long Beach. And as the staff report indicated, the new zoning calls not only address what types of uses are allowed, but for the first time it helps address the look of our corridors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is especially relevant for a portion of Atlantic Avenue that's in the eighth District. And I want to remind everybody that this is there's two two council districts involved in this plan, a district as well as a ninth district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the there's an area of the district that is designated as an opportunity zone. And so this type of plan only helps with investment and interest in our community. I'd like to thank the residents who participated in the planning process, as well as the development services staff who worked extensively on this effort, as well as engaging up'",

And I encourage residents to continue to be involved in Phase two, which is currently underway. I will address zoning and land uses throughout the rest of North Long Beach, and so there's opportunity still for community involvement.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'For many who are just looking for a change of scene or a safe, clean place to work for a few days, a vacation rental in Long Beach has been a lifeline.

        "'speaker_0': 'And each time we make substantive changes to try to make it the best fit for our community. I know that many of our constituents have called in tonight and said that they currently have issues with illegal Airbnbs right now, and that's actually why we brought this item to the Council over four years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We brought it because there was a black market essentially happening where these Airbnbs were operating and they weren't legal in the city. And when we talked to staff they came back and said we don't have the resources. So what happens is city prosecutor, city attorney, they send a letter out a cease and desist.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then, you know, they wait to hear back. They might send one more letter, but that's it. The city hasn't had any ability to hold accountable the bad operators in our town. That is why this item was brought forward, so that we could make sure that we allowed for people that wanted to host in their own home to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do that legally and that the city could collect revenue on it because they are operating like a hotel and that non hosted could also operate in a way where we're able to collect revenue but hold those accountable for those big parties that tend to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to ask staff a couple of questions because this is our fourth or fifth time to actually take a vote on this. I had hoped to try to move kind of quickly tonight. I know that there is a lot of division and you hear it in the public comments, homeowners versus renters and hotels versus Airbnb'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The fact is, is that there's not one model that fits everything. And this policy has tried to take into account protecting our housing stock. That's why it comes back with the housing vacancy number in there, and that's why we've tried to limit that number as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to ask staff right now for non hosted. Can you walk through the process for what happens and then can you walk through what would happen if we voted tonight to do this? How do we hold accountable the bad actors?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilmember Pearce, are you talking about the process for the host ID that's currently in place? No, I'm talking about the UNHOSTED right now on hosts that are not currently legal. What happens whenever a community member files a complaint on that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thank you. I'm going to ask Scott Baldwin, who's working directly on the enforcement to respond to this question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This for hosted or unhosted only. What we're doing right now is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Due to the ordinance. We have a 180 day period after enforcement began to allow everyone to be in compliance. So currently, you know, we're only three weeks removed from the effective date, so we're still in the 180 day period, giving operators time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Essentially to either comply or to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remove their listings and in or change their operations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember. Let me add to that, that response. So currently we have no mechanism for enforcement because unhosted or not regulated what the as you indicated our ability to regulate unhosted short term rentals will allow us more significantly significantly to work with Airbnb and other hosting platforms to be able to limit and prevent the marketing of that unit'",
        "'speaker_4': ', to take reservations, to move that project forward as well as additional enforcement. That's what we currently don't have and this process will allow us to enforce those things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there are fines that are included in this ordinance, correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we don't currently have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I walk through that because every time I have a conversation with one of my constituents that's upset about a party house, as I remind them that regulating it is the way that we get the tools in the toolbox to actually hold them accountable to the standards that we deserve to have in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I agree. I don't like you know, I'm hosted party houses next door, but for too long we've done this in a Wild West way. And so that is why we brought this item forward. I believe that, you know, we are in uncertain times, but aligning ourselves with the state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe it was mentioned in the in the PowerPoint, being able to say that the state says that we should have unhosted as the safest way instead of hosted. We did six months ago asked staff to work with the hosting platforms on cleaning requirements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I heard it in public comment. But staff, can you speak to that? Have you worked with the hosting platforms to ensure that the cleaning guidelines is up to CDC recommendations?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember We have worked with the hosting platforms as well as Dr. Davis and the Health Department, and we have provisions currently in our order to regulate the the short term rentals with language that is similar to the state order.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. And then I wanted to there's another comment that was made in public comment that said, we are taking a thousand units off of the market right now. Can you clarify how many staffers have been active before COVID?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I know we had those numbers in the report. That's Councilmember Pearce. Right now, within the last year, there's been approximately 670 and hosted stars that are active and approximately 170 and hosted stars. So that was a hosted I'm sorry, pardon me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was 170 hosted and 700 and hosted. Okay. So I it's pretty clear for the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Record that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Comment that we are taking units off the market is not happening. These units are have already been in use. This is part of this new economy that's emerged that we're all trying to grapple with and find a rocky balance policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce. Yeah. I'm sorry. Your 5 minutes is expired. Oh, I forgot about 5 minutes. Okay. Well, I will close out with saying that I believe that we should vote tonight to move forward. We've been doing this for four years, and I'd like to end with saying that this vote is not a vote against a hotel worker'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or a hotel. This is a vote to try to make sure that we have a balanced city that is really taking into account all the different models and ways that people want to stay at places and have their business and do it in a way that we can hold people accountable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, I urge my colleagues to pass this agenda tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the motion. The second is about Councilman Price. Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. You're Mr. Mayor. So I want to ask a lot of those comments. Biggest one for me. I know that the second and third district have the highest number of staffers and the number one unpermitted staffers. And the number one complaint that we get from residents is that there's really no enforcement mechanism right now for resident'",
        "'speaker_5': 'complaints because they think a house in the neighborhood is being used as a short term rental. They actually have to work with the city attorney's office and provide the evidence that the city attorney would need to issue some sort of a letter to the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it really puts neighbors in a bad position because they're trying to collect evidence on property owners within an adjacent home. And it's just it's not where we want our residents to be. So I know that these operations are happening, and I believe we need to have an enforcement mechanism so that we can hold people accountable for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the requirements to operate these stars. Right now, we have nothing to hold people accountable, and it's almost impossible to prove that they're operating it as an SDR without the neighbors testifying against.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The property owners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So as much as I understand a lot of the comments today, I think finding an enforcement arm to be able to regulate this activity that's already happening is very important. I would like I am interested in limiting the SDR from the recommendation that we received.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Councilmember Pearce, my question would be, would you accept a friendly to change the proposed ordinance that allows for a total of three to change it to a total of two, one being the primary and one being the unhosted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. And then the other question that I had for city staff was there remain concerns from constituents regarding the large scale event aspect of the ordinance. Can you please talk to that? Because what we don't want is to have residential neighborhoods that are having up to six large scale events in a residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And how can we limit or prohibit that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Price. Well, what we do have in the ordinance is what we call a limited event permit. That is to allow, on a infrequent basis, people to have more than the maximum occupancy limit at that place. It's very similar to an occasional event permit that the special permit, special events office regulates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The host or operator would have to prepare the same information that goes into the occasional event permit. How many people are going to be there? Is there going to be music? These types of things and going through this process will be able to in the future deny people that are bad actors and don't conform to those permits'",
        "'speaker_5': '. We're allowing six per year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. Thank you for reminding me that we're recommending that maximum of six be allowed per year at each individual short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to make a friendly to limit that or reduce that to four. If Council member Pearce is open to that and I also want to make sure that there is a process in place where neighbors will be able to weigh in like we do with the occasional that permit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess I don't see a problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there a process in place where neighbors can oppose such a permit?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, they can. They could. They. Well, let me circle back with you. There is no public process to a review process for any time. They're issuing an occasional event permit. We can consider what we can do to inform the community about these permits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like staff to please look into that. But I don't want to hold up the process this evening. And then finally, can you just speak to the opt out process in terms of who initiate who needs to initiate that for neighborhoods that are interested in that process?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly. So it is a resident that will contact the city and say that they would like their census block group to opt out of the unhosted short term rentals. What will then happen is that the city will initiate a mail mail in balloting process for all the residential property owners within that census block group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. Thank you very much. I have nothing further.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Day has.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember Pearson Price for this item. I know that you guys have been working on this item far, far beyond when I came on to the council. So I know how invested you are on short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted to see if maybe I could, you know, make a friendly I know that coming from a district to where I house a lot of of workers that work in our hotels and and have seen a lot of them lose their jobs during this pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Really, really touches my heart and breaks my heart for what they're going through. So I know that short term rentals could devastate them even more, but I understand that there has to be some kind of balance. And I'd like to offer a friendly to see if maybe we could limit the amount of unhosted rentals to be permitted'",
        "'speaker_5': 'from 1000 to 700. Is that something that you would accept? Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that we've had this discussion before with this council, so I'd like to see where the discussion is. I know that right now we're at 640 and know that there's been some other discussion around coming back. So let's see where the council colleagues are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And I'll come back up then. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I appreciate the discussion today. I'm interested in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A couple of things. One, I'll just say that I know that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Original there are lots of cities that have unlimited number of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ideas. I know the staff came forward with an initial number and a chart for us, and I just wanted to remind everyone that a thousand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was the number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We compromised too. And so during this time we were only allowing hosted to register. So 640 of those spots is already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are already taken. So there's really only 260 available for the and hosted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was interested in asking a point of clarification for Councilman Price. You had mentioned you wanted to go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From one primary and two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I couldn't hear. That was one primary and two. What, three total where one had to be their primary and now the friendly was to make it so that it was to. One their primary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one additional. Are you open to making it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or I guess it would be to Janine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Pearce, are you open to having it be just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To general and they can decide if it's their primary or not? I'd like to stick with Councilmember Price's motion, because we've done so much work over the last four years on saying that if somebody was going to have an additional one, that they needed to live in one, that, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is too big of a shift to make tonight. Okay. So they could still just have one that is not their primary. That was Councilmember Price's motion. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. No additional comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Councilman Ranga, then councilman is in Dallas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Mayor, can we correct something? I think that was just quickly in the stated. Elisa, can you answer a question on that, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, sure. What I wanted to say is that the limit on Unhosted is currently a thousand. Right now operating in the city. Within the past year has been at 700 unhosted and currently we have 170 hosted. Those 170 hosted do not apply to the limit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And of those, 173 have actually registered with us. Thank you. That's a very important point of clarification. Thank you, Mr. Modica.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've got some Ringo and councilmen and they ask.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. I have a couple of questions, but I just wanted to make sure that I'm. Listening correctly. So we're talking about the debt limits. We talked about limit of 1000. That is up to 1000 and where I currently had 700.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, Councilmember. Could you repeat that? I had trouble hearing you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The number of stories we have on hosted the discussion right now is to have a total number of 1000. That's a top level. And from what I heard, or even if I'm wrong, is that there are currently 700 unhosted stores currently in use at the present time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there are 300 more that we can allow at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There would be 300 additional that we are not currently operating between. The 700 that we know of operated within the last year and the 1000 limit that we have discussed in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is being proposed. Okay. So consequently, there are the discussions that we're having here. Then it's not necessarily that we want to lower the number of on host approach to keep it at a maximum of a thousand. It's another way of putting it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would that be correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other aspect of this, and I'm trying to get a clarification on and I haven't seen anything, is that the number of days that a host is?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in terms of the unhosted str, there is no limit on the number of days that they can operate during the year where.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They enter the aforesaid. I got I got a call right in the middle when you just started. I'm sorry. Can you start over with that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. So presently or what had been discussed for the unhosted that there would be no limit on the number of days that they could operate during the year when there was a discussion of a potential limit. That was when we were discussing a primary, a STR, which is where the individual lived, that they could operate that home'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as an on hosted for up to 90 days during a year. That was that limit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're not that is not part of this discussion at all in terms of what number of days a person can stay the unless year. Posted around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. That would be for further consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the reason I'm bringing this up is because obviously sometimes it starts functionally rental units when there are no limits placed on the number of days that a guest can stay at a short term rental. And that's my concern at this point, especially glad to see that there was a adjustment being proposed and a friendly and being'",
        "'speaker_1': 'accepted from going from a to a non primary and one primary to one primary and one not in terms of residence. So that that's that's good. But I'm still having concerns that even that one unhosted would function as a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mentioned before being a bad actor where an individual will have a star there, and that would be basically an apartment rental. Not unless you are still concerned about that. The other aspect of it is that we're talking about removal, removal of affordable housing, especially when I'm talking about along the coasts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you may know, I'm a member of the California Coastal Commission, and one of the biggest concerns that we always have up and down the coast is affordable housing along the coast. Has there been an average done in terms of what the cost of these streets are in Long Beach in regards to Austin or other hosted units'",
        "'speaker_1': '? Where do they sit with the with the rental market here in Long Beach?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember. We do not have any current information regarding what the what the rates are. I'm happy to come back to you after we have some time to research that item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm saying that now because that will be a concern once this issue comes before the Commission. And affordability for housing along the coast is very important to the commission, and it would be something that would be seriously considered as to whether or not the city would be able to modify its LCP in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this allows.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council member this is Christopher Koonce. That is absolutely a concern for lower cost housing to the degree that it is occupied as a rental today. But in our discussions with the Coastal Commission staff, they're also very concerned with lower cost visitor accommodations, which is a specific reference in the Coastal Act statute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we do know from Coastal Commission data that Airbnb or BRP, these type of units are typically more affordable, particularly to families, than full service hotel rooms. And it's for that reason that a coastal commission, at least at the staff level, has advised us that they see these types of units as a tool to meet their lower'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cost visitor accommodation goal. And they have expressed some concern just that the staff, the staff level about the council's previous action to allow only that hosted because they were concerned that it may not provide sufficient lower cost visitor accommodations within the coastal zone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Urunga. Your time has expired.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, that would be my major concern at the present time, but I'll continue the discussion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up is Consumers in house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor. And after hearing some more on this from staff, I was wondering, council member Pearce said maybe we could consider lowering the Unhosted max to maybe 800. Is that something that you would accept as a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor. Do we have other people queued up to speak?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. This is from the after this. We're going to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I will accept your motion. You're a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A agree. And also, might you be able to accept that we that we have city staff come back to us in 6 to 9 months to reevaluate, you know, and see where we are with, especially since we're in a health crisis right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that in the original ordinance there's a staff supposed to come back annually with the vacancy rate. Is that correct stuff? Yes, that is correct. Okay. So since we're lowering the number, giving us, you know, I think 12 months to come back is a reasonable amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Remember? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That can actually count for a. Just check it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Eric Garcia. I just have a point of clarification and I think possibly a lot of residents are confused. I mean, basically, it's counterintuitive to think that we have to allow Unhosted in order to regulate them. But specifically, I'd like to ask Councilman Price to clarify what the 6 to 4 party's friendly means and and whether'",
        "'speaker_1': 'there is an annual unhosted limit for a house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I can I can talk about the the for the from six to force a staff was recommending six large scale events be permitted per ACR per year. And I ask that to be reduced to four with a request that staff look into a notification process for neighbors in the area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that was my my friendly which Councilmember Pearce accepted. I don't know that I could speak with any expertize on the other item. That might be a better for staff question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, yeah. And I think if I could ask staff, how how would the word get out to the public or how would there be notification on the policies?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we need to come back to you with to provide you additional information. But the ideas that we provide on our website, an opportunity to notice the community about pending applications for events.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That concludes our council comment. Go ahead. Yes. Did you just did you are you did you cued up again? Okay, customer. Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, I just wanted to clarify. In the past, when we've talked about the vacancy rate, we've talked about the number of units being able to go up when the vacancy rate is above 8%. So I just wanted to confirm that that is still in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that it was in the report that the vacancy rate was variable. I just wanted to confirm. Oh. Yes. It was in the in the ordinance. That's right. So with that, you know, support the motion that's on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Roll call. Vote, please.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'harassment. I think the addition of of bad faith, of the bad faith requirement is pretty straightforward. I've heard some of the speakers say that that would make it more difficult, at least in some instances, to for a tenant to prove that they are being harassed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's that's true. On the other side of the coin, of course, is that it would provide landlords who are acting in good faith but may make a mistake in the way they characterize eviction moratoriums or the law or in if they are forgetful about cashing a check.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both of those things, you know, would constitute harassment. And I think the addition of the word bad faith and the reason why other jurisdictions have included it is probably to ensure that landlords, when they make mistakes but are acting in good faith, are not the subject of a lawsuit from a tenant.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, sorry. Councilmember Pierce, this is. This is Deputy City Attorney Rich Anthony. If I understand your question correctly, each subsection is it would be 8.101.030 of the existing ordinance, subsection eight. That is the one that makes it that is the subsection that makes it harassment for a landlord to provide or to misrepresent the status of eviction moratoriums'",

And that that is that's one of them that I heard the friendly which Councilmember Price accepted, which would now specifically require that mischaracterization would have to be made in bad faith in order for it to constitute harassment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I know that I'm I don't want to try to make tonight long. I feel like there's been from hearing Councilmember Richardson negotiations. I just want to make sure, you know, as a tenant myself who's experienced continual harassment and had rent increases after trying to get things done, maybe it's not right in this item, but I know'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that everybody with the apartment association is listening. I know that small landlords are listening. One of the biggest challenges that we have is that landlords might claim that they do not know that the law. So I got a letter from my landlord and he said, I got it from the apartment association.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It didn't mention one thing about the California law, and it included a bunch of documents that he tried to get me to sign. This is an urgent issue that I hope that the apartment association will figure out how to work with their members in a more transparent way with the least amount of paperwork as possible.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman's in the house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vice Mayor, just a quick question for city attorney, if you would please clarify. What what do the what does the burden of proof on tenants in these circumstances after the recommendations by Councilmember Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the House. That's a difficult one to answer, as has been stated by some of the speakers and I think by some of the council members, the no doubt it will make it a bit harder on a tenant to prove harassment because now in certain instances, they are going to have to prove of bad faith.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exactly what that proof will prove in bad faith requires. I can't really speak to it's going to be very, I think, factually dependent. It's going to be very much up to the superior court judge who hears the case.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's very hard for me to give you an answer on exactly how much more difficult this would make it for the average tenant to prove harassment. And I also don't know the experience that other jurisdictions have had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I don't know if the bad faith requirement in other jurisdictions, which have it significantly tamps down the successful harassment cases or not. My guess is that it does not. But but I don't really know that that's just a gut feel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm sorry I can't give you a more factually based answer, but it's tough.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, yes, it's understandable at the same time. And of course, I'm having a hard time because a lot of my residents are going through harassment by their landlords. And so it makes it tough. But I'm happy to see the amendments that were made to to this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews. Yes. Thank you. You know, I've been listening to everyone speak on the side of Alan Reed very clear that, you know, supporting, you know, tenants, especially those on Orange Avenue, because I think I know that this is between a landlord and a slumlord and that one avenue should've been unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those individuals, I myself would even go to court with them because I know that was total, total harassment. Anyone take down security bars and lights and fences to the back? That was harassment. But if our city attorney agrees, we need to be a little more clear on language avoidance, then we should do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, other cities have bad faith language in the ordinance, and we want to model what other cities are doing. That was the point of threatening the owners. And so we should follow through. And I want to thank you, Councilman Richardson, on some of the changes that can be made this work for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what I'm really trying to do. I know everyone would not be happy, but there comes a point in these.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then, like you say, if you are in good faith.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or bad faith, someone is going to have to be held accountable on both ends. You have a landlord that is so in bad faith that that individual has to be held accountable for that and they should be taken to court.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know the judge to ensure fair play in that situation. So I'm just hoping that there's a way that Councilman Richardson clarified this and we can lease, but most of us are on an even keel. I want to thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All my tennis resident. Everyone will join me in tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, customary ringa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very, very quickly. We practiced ordinance disposal. We debated this issue and it was shot down. So I'm not very I'm at the point in the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we have Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mr. Mayor. So just for just a little bit of clarification here, because I'm rereading the language here and it looks like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We the.'",

I know we're going to be amending I'll start in alphabetical order, B, subsection B of 8.1 or 1.03 of subsection B to add in bad faith. At the start of that section, which was in bad faith, failed to timely perform repairs and maintenance required by a rental agreement'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate hearing from my colleagues tonight. And again, hopefully there's there's a will to just at least hear what I'm saying and what I'm what I what this is about is, you know, we live in a country where our system, our court system is designed so that everybody can have an opportunity to have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'their day in court. And in talking with elected officials and attorneys representing some of these other jurisdictions that adopted kind of harassment policies, there's oftentimes and I know several cities have been cited, there is a mental state component, because the intent of this legislation is is not to give everybody, you know, not to deny anybody their day'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in court, but to have some sort of objective standard, a burden of proof, so to speak, to be met to determine if someone violated the law. So in the example, for example, somebody made a comment about someone providing maybe information that's inaccurate law.'",

And so if you're relying on an old book of statutes, for example, you may miss some change that's not included in your version because you're looking at A to night 2019 edition of the Code'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and not the 2020 edition. But that may mean that you just made a mistake, that you're not you're not operating based on the current laws that include current legislation. And so we want to make sure that people have an opportunity to go into court and say, I'm so sorry that was a mistake, and have a judge be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'able to determine, based on all the evidence, if that person is acting in bad faith or if they genuinely made a mistake. Every single example we heard tonight from those who called in on 73 are absolutely examples of people who are bad actors repeated harassment, retaliation, intentional confusion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The evidence there is I could just tell from some of the accounts that we were told just during public comment that there's more than one incident, that there's more than one failure to act. There's more one act more than one act of negligence.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those that's all evidence that a tenant will have the right to present so that the tenants don't lose any rights by this modification. They can still sue whoever they want. But the the landlord now has an opportunity to be able to present their case, and the judge now has the burden of proof.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the burden of proof is what is the standard. It's did this person act with a bad intent? Because I don't think any of us here believe that anyone should be wrongfully accused and not have an opportunity to present their own case in a court of law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know we all fundamentally believe that in our justice system, and that's what this is about. It's not to take away any rights. It's to allow everybody to have a meaningful opportunity to present their case in court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do believe that our judicial officers, when listening to all the evidence, will make the right call. Our system works as long as we set up laws that allow everyone to have their day in court. So I want to thank my counsel colleagues that are open and willing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Councilman Richardson is absolutely right. There are portions of the provisions that don't need the bad language because they sufficiently cover a mental state. Some of them don't, and they're too ambiguous. So thank you very much for your consideration of supporting this item.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Working with youth and mentoring youth has impacted the lives of many in the community and throughout this city as a public servant for both the city and the school district. Dee Andrews has been described as a scholar, as a champion, as a local hero, and the council member or vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with this item, we will solidify him as a legend of the city to the field. The sports complex was an impact project for the central area. He championed it through when it was nothing and just a vision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This happened during his tenure on the city council. And to be quite frank, I wanted to and I thought the council should have done something a long time ago. I know we have a policy that somebody should be deceased before we named items after them or parks or buildings after them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we believe this council has departed from that policy because I think it's important for and I think our colleagues recognize that it's important for us to allow individuals to smell the roses and to be honored why they are among us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've had the pleasure of speaking with the newly elected sixth District Council member, Sally Sara, who has pledged her support for this this item. This is a beginning of the process, and she will carry this through to the finish line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe once we are done, this will be a unifying event for all the residents of the sixth District to show the appreciation for the their council member of Vice Mayor de Andres and the service that he has provided over the years and his commitment to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so with that, I would like to just move the item and ask for your unanimous support.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Austin, thank you so much for bringing this item forward. You know, I tell people often that we get to work with one another as colleagues and over the course of time we develop admiration for one another, even though we don't always agree with one another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And through the process, we also develop, I hope, lifetime friendships with at least some of our colleagues. And I know that Vice Mayor Andrews is somebody who will be a friend and someone that my family and I respect for for decades and generations to come.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He's made such an impact on the youth and our community. He has definitely shown me how much determination and standing up and doing the right thing can do in terms of shaping your future. He hasn't always had an easy route in life.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He hasn't had the simplest journey. He's made it through, through life, through sheer hard work and learning from his lessons and and just being a model human being and very human in every way, which means he carries his strengths and he carries his weaknesses and he's not shy about them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that's what we need in leaders. He charts his own course, and I really appreciate that about him. I've learned a lot from him, and I'm really proud to live in a city that honors him and honors his work today and for generations to come.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if there were ever a time for us to waive our policy in regards to naming city assets, this would be one of them. Thank you for your service. Vice Mayor Andrews and I so look forward to being there on the day that we celebrate the renaming of this site with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council Member Superdome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Bear with him having a little trouble with my voice tonight. I'll try to speak up. And if staff could get my media ready and appreciate that, it's an honor to sign on to this item. And thanks for Councilman Austin for bringing it forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My admiration for Vice Mayor Andrews includes his legacy of leadership as Polish high school's first African-American student body president. Tonight's item, however, is about the naming of an athletic field. So I'll stick to the topic. The agenda is the memo refers to Andrews as a poly high school athletics legend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To put that statement into perspective, I'd like to quote these high school coach Dave Levy, who went on from poly to coach at USC and in the NFL for 16 years. Coach Levy stated I've coached Heisman Award winning backs in college, all pro and Hall of Fame backs and AFL.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Andy Andrews was the best running back I ever coached. I'd also like to mention another school where DH was an athletic legend. Long Beach City College. To put that statement in perspective, we have a video of this 1960 junior Roosevelt kickoff return against Tyler, Texas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So staff, if you're able to run that video, we'd love to see it. Bobby Pryce kicks off with the cheering Apache still whooping it up. It's a long one clear to the goal line where Martin gathers it in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Willie starts to his left but is mad at the 50. Roy hands off to De Andrews. A burst of speed takes him by two Apaches a great block by flank. Roy Whiteside, another one. And Jim Smith takes the rest.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Andrews oh 14 flag high hurdler and long gone 85 yards and an electrifying touchdown that's completely shatters the Texans enthusiasm. Vice Chair Andrews from a young fan who watched you in the Rose Bowl in 1962, got the privilege to call you colleague 35 years later.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for your incredible contributions and service to our city. I wholeheartedly support this agenda item. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. What a what a heartwarming, heartfelt tribute to Vice Mayor. Andrews. Rosemary Andrews is a living legend. I've said it. Most of us will say it. And and and I appreciate the fact that our young people that grow up in the community will learn history, will understand that, you know, he grew up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's always broken barriers and demonstrated excellence and leadership and all the way through his from his time as an athlete, all the way through to its time as a retiring as the vice mayor of our city, which is a tremendous accomplishment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, I stand in support of this. I want to congratulate my Vice Mayor, Andrews. I look forward to supporting it. I also want to acknowledge and thank council member, incoming council member Sauro. Those were incredibly. I'll use gasoline prices words that were incredibly classy comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it really shows how we can come together after difficult elections and heal and put the community first and move forward. So this is a great moment and I'm happy to support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Zendejas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You, Mayor? I just wanted to congratulate Vice Mayor de Andrews for all of his work that he's done on council in the last 13 years. As as we all know on council, it's not easy. It's not an easy job to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But when you know that you're doing it for your residents, for your community, then it's all worthwhile. So I just wanted to say thank you for all your years of service and thank you for all your lessons. And we look forward to that day when they name this special place after you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Something very wrong.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We will be speaking more about you. It's great to be here with you and we will certainly support you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm going to wrap up and then I'll turn over to the vice mayor. I'm going to save most of my comments to the vice mayor for when we have our our farewell. But I just want, you know, vice mayor.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I want to go there. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to lend my support to this item. I think it's been fantastic. I know that we've talked about putting down this policy in the past for some specific examples, but I think this is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A worthy one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just again, vice mayor, I completely support this. Thank you to everyone that introduced this. And I know you and I have been talking about this and I've mentioned, you know, there's very few people that have the four years of service and commitment that you have to our community and absolutely well deserved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm really, really heartened that your colleagues are supporting you and I'm doing this for you. I think it's a great legacy for you and it's great for the city. So very supportive. And with that, we will turn it over to Mr. Andrews and then go to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mark. First of all, I want to thank Councilman Austin to praise Councilman Councilman now and Mrs. Cynthia to bring this item forward. You know, I was just wondering, how long is it going to take? You know how I'm 80 years old.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, with all of that, you guys, I really want to let you know I'm truly humbled and I appreciate all of my colleagues on this council. It's been a great experience over the years, and I'm going to say much, much more because, you know, I don't see that much in the guys anyway.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Laura Payson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. This is Laura Barzan. I'm a deputy district attorney and a resident of Spinnaker Bay. My backyard sits adjacent to Boathouse Lane. So my family and I are privy to what is quickly becoming a hotbed of illicit activity after dark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every day, for the last several months around, sunset cards of young adults arrive to what they apparently see as a haven for their bad behavior. This behavior includes underage drinking, public use of marijuana and other narcotic sexual activity incredibly fast, loud and dangerous street racing and illegal fireworks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These individuals seem to know that it is virtually impossible for them to get caught as they have quickly, as they have a quick and easy escape route. And nuisance calls to this area are an extremely low priority. Accordingly, there simply are no repercussions for their criminal behavior.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they know this. Despite that, in an effort to fight the deterioration of this area of Long Beach, I personally have called the police several times when I've witnessed any semblance of illicit activity, whether that be racing trucks, nearly mowing down children and killing them, or marijuana wafting into the backyard when my kids are playing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That these people on whom we call the police may somehow try to retaliate is another fear shared by many neighbors, and it presents yet another problem with their presence. After dark, it's come to our attention that there is a concern by some that the new hours for gate closure would deprive growers of access to growing activities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are not in any way trying to limit access to the growing community and we believe their concerns can be addressed simply by allowing specific access to Rolling Thunder representatives at all times. Marine Stadium is a beautiful place for all to enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community of Spinnaker Bay is asking only for a simple measure to help keep it that way. This measure will without a doubt send a clear message to those looking for a safe place to break the law. That is, your criminal activity will not be tolerated.'",

I also know that verbal promises are not worth much. Therefore, I urge you, do not change access hours as it is the letter of the law that will govern govern future access.'",

The first is the potentially devastating effect this proposal can have on each of the five separate growing programs that operate out of the PDX Rowing Center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These programs comprise hundreds of athletes that range in age from 14 to 86. We come from every corner of the city, making this a matter not limited to District three. Throughout the 88 years that rowing has been a part of the fabric of Long Beach, we have depended on early morning and after work afterschool access to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'waterways and our athletic facilities. Given the marginal effectiveness of existing enforcement measures, the sacrifices being asked of us are likely to be in vain. Plus, I have reason to believe that the recent miscreant activity is a combination of factors that have made 2020 special, namely organized political disobedience and restlessness from COVID induced boredom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These will in time pass, but our activities may be collateral damage in the process. A good faith effort is being made to mitigate these consequences, such as by issuing gate keys to users of the boathouse. This is my second concern at the devil is in the details.'",

Thank you to Councilwoman Price for listening to us and taking our concerns seriously as the residents of the Bay were located immediately adjacent to the ruins that are parking lots.

Contrary to the concerns and sentiments being expressed tonight, the residents nor the ordinance are looking to impair front and center operations.'",

The reckless driving down boathouse lane pass speed constantly after smoking, pot drinking and are going to kill somebody coming out of our two access points that have significant blind slot entering onto boathouse lane.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilmember Price, for this item. One of the things that I was concerned about is definitely the access. I know that I have one of my very good friends now who has been rowing for almost as long as I've known him over almost ten years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And he's been part of the adaptive rowing, a group that uses this facility on a, you know, on a regular basis, especially after sunset, when everybody, all the volunteers come out to help and they they help prepare, you know, everything for the night's activities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they help everyone out of their wheelchairs and into the boats. And so, you know, that's very important to me. And, you know, that's something that you know, it's a program that I'm very proud that we have here in Long Beach to have an actual really good establish adaptive rowing program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I really hope that we can look at giving access and continuing giving access to the ones that are doing these kind of activities. And just for clarification. Councilmember Price, you were right now, the the recommendations that you added right now is to allow more access.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So just so my recommendation and I think a lot of the speakers maybe in anxiety or anticipation of speaking, didn't hear my comments. The proposal is that the audience would access would be from 5 a.m. until 8 p.m. that's what the ordinance would read.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But of course, we would work with the tenants of the building to make sure that they have access to the additional times, which I'll I'll talk about a little bit further when you're done with your comments. Council members in the House.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Because I think that that's very important that that they know that we're trying to kind of extend and be able to provide access. So I thank you for that, Councilwoman. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gentlemen. Mongo. And then we're going to go back to Councilman Price for a close up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. How do we currently restrict the access?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a fence or a gate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Guess some of the comments confuse me a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bit because I was just down there last weekend and it seems as though maybe Councilmember Price could provide some clarity. In her comments on it sounds like it's going to be 8 p.m.. It cut out again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So. So, just by way of background, in 1993, the city entered into an agreement with Coastal Commission. That boathouse lane would close at the same time as Marine Stadium, which is an hour after dusk. For whatever reason, the ordinance that was passed by the City Council in 1994 excluded boathouse lane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so even though Boathouse Lane was contemplated to be included and treated the same as Marine Stadium, it was not. We try to identify why that change was made at council, whether it was inadvertent or for some other reason, and we just couldn't find the backup material to support that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's been closed at 10 p.m. for a number of years, and so since 1994 and actually before then, according to Alveda Hallinan, who manages our our Marine operations. And so the requests from the residents and this is a really a resident initiated request was that we consider closing it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They definitely didn't want to interfere with rowing operations, but around 8 p.m. and so the city staff actually reached out to Eldora and I personally talked with BJC and it looks like Sarah McKenzie, the facility manager at Eldora, provided the list of activities at the center and identified the times that would be appropriate to accommodate all the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'members. And that's where the recommendation that I made tonight at the start of my comments came from in terms of the hours of operation. But we've made it very, very clear to all Eldora and all BJC members, I've been dealing with this now for three full days of contact with members that we will do everything we can'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to accommodate our tenants in that facility. Now, I did hear from some folks this evening that are saying they're there operating some sort of classes out of the facility. I'm not sure that they're legally or officially a tenant in our lease, so we'll have to look into that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in terms of the tenants with whom we have an official legal relationship at that city asset, we will accommodate the hours to make sure that they have access to the recreational facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful, as long as everyone's been considered and consulted. I know that there's always work that can still be done after.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that you'll work towards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Making sure that happens. Thank you, Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, Councilman Price, did you want to add anything else before we go to a vote?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Yes, Mr. Mayor, I do. I want to thank everybody who called. Then again, I started off my comments by saying that we're going to maintain that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out hours. The evening hours. We're asking for a reduction until 8 p.m. not at us to accommodate the ten operational facilities. And so we have the tenants that we have and subleases, we'll do every canned fixture we'll have in regards to the activities that the residents are concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First of all, the residents, it was very, very important for them because this is going to be about a six month long process before it goes to Coastal. So the residents wanted us to get the process started before we got the process started, before we filed our item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Parks Rec and Marine reached out to the facility manager, informed them that we were looking at changes and got a list of programing. I also specifically spoke with one of the up lessees, LBJ D and made sure that they knew we would accommodate the programs the residents have called the police on on numerous occasions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I know we have Long Beach PD on the call. I'm not sure if they can weigh in to share with us what some of the calls for service data looks like in this area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor and city council. This is Commander McGuire and the council tonight. With respect to calls for service on the boathouse lane in 2018, we have a total of 13, 2019, we had 23. And so far this year we've had 34.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we definitely are seeing an increase. Most of the calls reckless driving, loud noises, groups, parties, illegal drug use, that type of thing. In addition to that, this year we've had over 800 what we would consider officer initiated calls where the officers were just out there trying to be visible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a very remote area, relatively speaking, but they're trying to be visible. They're trying to be out in the area to kind of mitigate some of the things that we have been seeing and hearing about. But for our perspective, we have there definitely has been an uptick in the calls for service and the amount of activity'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the officers are engaging in in that area. I hope that helps.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very much. I really appreciate that report. With that, I would ask my colleagues to support this item again. It's going to be a six month long process about hopefully sooner than that. We're going to ask the city attorneys to work with coastal staff to do a little bit more research.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did receive a letter from Coastal this afternoon. Staff is going to have to follow up on that and make sure that we are aligned in terms of the issues of access, which as everyone heard tonight, are very, very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just want to thank everyone for calling in and to the rowing community. My boys row for LBJ. See, I'm on your team. We will provide access. We will accommodate. We want the adaptive rowing programs and diverse programs that bring the region and residents from all over the city and introduce them to the water.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want those programs to continue. We appreciate having that partnership with all of you. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I, I'd like to see restaurants. I'm open. If the council says, hey, let's include everyone. I think we should just at least make sure, like, 75% of this is restaurants. I'm sure the rest of the council members are hearing what I'm hearing, that there certainly a lot of anxiety among the restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we should focus on trying to get whatever support we can to them, particularly until we see whether there's going to be relief in terms of Heroes Act or something like that. I'd love to make sure that these dollars have as great of an impact as possible to the votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my motion would be we target this, the restaurant, so so I would make the motion the way that we discussed. So this is all service independent restaurants for the fire, the health and the alarm fees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the 75% or higher than that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we do 100%. But if the council wants to negotiate that, I'm fine with that. I think we go 100%. We just target restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, understood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fine. There's a second accept councilman reticence to. Who's the second?'",
