But now, of course, we're back to a place where there is just no support coming in because of the additional closures that we've had to make.

        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm really talking about the brick and mortar gyms. I recently listened to this piece where Mary Garcia talks about how successful his personal trainer is and the Zoom classes and all these at home virtual gyms that are coming about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But those don't grow the local economy. Those are also not the people who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and the indoor gym faces jumping through hoops to get business permits and licenses, paying property taxes, sales tax while hiring and employing residents to keep the economy going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My story is not unique, but one that I hope helps you understand why we in the fitness studio space are going through. I have my gym just four months before the closure of March a lot and had added five new jobs, had 138 members were growing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had to lay off lay off all of my five employees. We were able to pivot, offer online classes, but I still lost 85% of my best monthly income. June came, July closed again, and all of this fall just hitting only 40% of my monthly income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Building that on top of that, we moved out to a part brand workout when we could only have earned back a mere 50% of our monthly revenue month over month. Some of you may feel that outdoor workouts are great and I don't disagree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, from a business owner standpoint, we have to pay our employees a shuttle equipment that we can move outdoors, set it up, break it down to size hours and for payroll expenses. Then we have to buy outdoor systems, outdoor lighting, flooring, cell phone, iPad hotspot, additional insurance that covers outside all of this while we're still paying rent'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cans, property taxes and insurance and business licensing fees, office space that we can't use. And it's just not sustainable. We never ask restaurants to move their complete operation outdoors. We never said Your custom chef has to move your kitchens outside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But effectively, that's what we said for fitness studios, plain and simple. How long can gyms endure this while every other personal service has been allowed open? We keep getting pushed to the end of the line. There's no data showing gyms or any more dangerous or deadly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mental and physical health benefits that gym offer far outweigh those of any other personal service that's been allowed open. And according to several medical journals, exercise boost immunity by immobilizing or infection fighting immune cells. And those activated during and after exercise are the best friends we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even more so after speaking to multiple pediatricians and doctors here in Long Beach. The biggest issues we face after COVID has come and gone is the true and silent pandemic our children are falling victim to, and that's obesity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have to keep the gym industry going here in Long Beach, not only with the idea of a popular brand, but we need to have a plan to allow gyms to open as essential businesses, whether through application permit process that we all know so well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need a path to opening, sustaining and in order to offer the mental and physical health we all need right now, if our Long Beach Health Department can determine who gets the vaccine and when they get it. All of this outside of L.A. County's jurisdiction, then I'm confident the Long Beach Health Department can determine how and when'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Christine Bass and I serve as the government affairs manager for the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. I'm speaking today on behalf of our 670 members, representatives and community stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We applaud the Mayor for deepening the response to the pandemic and supporting our most vulnerable industries and our small businesses. Our cities, business, community and local workforce face unimaginable challenges during this unprecedented time, and we must do everything that we can to keep these industries afloat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Initially, it was predicted that the pandemic would have had the largest impact on the hospitality industry. But recent findings show that the pandemic has negatively impacted the personal care services, restaurant and fitness fitness industry. For this reason, we respectfully ask the Council to approve this fund for personal service and fitness centers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Think your next speaker is Mike Murchison.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members as a resident, a lifelong resident of Long Beach in the eighth District. Now, I appreciate the mayor's comments on the Resiliency Fund and his support for local businesses. I noted that there was 5 million for restaurants predicated upon the CARES Act funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a bit concerning for the following reasons for me, not because the mayor is pushing for it. I applaud that. It's more about the fact that there are over 300 full service independent restaurants in Long Beach. So if they all apply for funding, that's only $12,500 each and that's not going to cut it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That amount goes down if you expand that list to the entire food service industry. In reality, mayor and council members, these independent restaurants to survive, to get through the next several months, they need about $50,000 to really make a difference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other problem with receiving federal funding that goes through the city, through economic development. When you apply for a grant. You go through a process with the city. That process takes 2 to 2 and a half months to actually physically get a check.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So while we talk about getting the money to the restaurants and all that through the grant process, the economic development staff is terrific. In reality, it's taking too long. The city needs to find a way to expedite that process, to get the money in the hands of these independent restaurant owners who basically have poured their lives into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'their restaurants and their businesses. Finally, I would also add the hotels have been impacted by this, not just the hotels in terms of ownership, but the employees, the tenants that live in Long Beach. They need some cares act money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would respectfully ask that the mayor and council look at the hotels in Long Beach along with their employees, and come up with some funding for them too through the CARES Act. Thank you very much for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think, Councilman Austin, I think you queued up for this item. I'm assuming not for the next one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And I just wanted to obviously express my support for this item. Thank you, Mayor, for your work, lobbying and working with the administration in advance to try to secure all this. The floor. It's a relief for that that will help many of our residents, business owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to just just highlight the intent here or get some some clarification, as I understand it, because I think one of the public commenters made a very good point. So the personal services and total. What would be the applicant had to tie or somehow show some nexus to brick and mortar business, as opposed to just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being an independent personal service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Trainer or something like that. Well, let me add to that. I think now I think that's a good question. So I think the staff is going to come back with both of the programs because that is going to be a consideration when we look at the amount of personal services, the amount of brick and mortar versus those'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that are more, you know, do work not to a brick and mortar is substantially different. And so that's something that staff will look at. And one of the reasons why we're bringing this program and the restaurant program forward now, instead of waiting for the money to come in, is for the exact reason that one of the commenters'",
        "'speaker_0': 'mentioned that we don't want to wait like we did for the Last Cares Act money right then to create the program. We want it done now. We want the council to approve the programs. When the money's here, everyone's giving their input and we have a good system going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think those are good questions and hopefully staff will address those when those come back in January.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'numbers that we experienced today are higher than what they were during the last spike. But unfortunately, we we you know, I've been on a few picket lines and and workers have been fighting for this for for a while.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we were hoping to have gotten there. But but, you know, it hasn't happened. So I think it's certainly necessary. I want to, you know, bring to our attention that another city council in Los Angeles made a motion to do something similar just just earlier today and go to two $5.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think where where we are, a motion stands on its own integrity. And we we we certainly are supportive of $4 that four months zero pay. I hope that the companies come forward and do something voluntarily as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One point that I want to raise up as a friendly is when we initiated worker protections for ICE in terms of sick leave during the summer, we carved out and protected small businesses. We have bodegas, you know, and small markets who do serve grocers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think the intent here is to protect is to, you know, sort of treat the large, publicly traded, sort of larger chain grocers very differently than the small, small businesses who are having a difficult time just keeping up with ease and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we're sick leave. We pegged it at 500 employees nationally. I understand that Los Angeles just packed bear that 300 employees nationally. I think we should do the same thing in this case. I want to offer a friendly amendment to Councilwoman Zendaya's that we also include a provision to exempt grocers that are 300 employees or more'",
        "'speaker_3': 'nationally, well below sorry, lower than 300 employees and below nationally. So I want to I want to I certainly want to offer that. And I'll wait on the response for in a moment. The second thing I want to highlight is that there was a slide up a bit earlier, and I don't know if we can get it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'back up, but I asked for that slide to come up because it makes and it illustrates an interesting point and I'll describe until we'll see if it can come up, but I'll describe it. Here it is. It looks like it's coming up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this slide really illustrates this was put forward by Dr. Side Steinmetz, who, you know, puts forward the Quarterly Economic Summit in partnership with Economic Forum. And. And what it showed was individuals making 27 to $60000 a year or individuals making 60,000 and up for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're almost back to where we were in terms of employment levels sort of at the beginning. Prior to that, we're almost back. But if you look at for low wage workers and low wage families, people living within the poverty line, this is this illustrates that their trend is heading in the wrong direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what that means is the economic impact of COVID is harder and is widening economic gaps on low wage workers. And so it will require some level of economic attention, inclusive economic policy, to make sure that frontline workers, low wage workers, are not left behind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hourly workers are not left behind. As we as we move forward. And this this this just illustrates it. But if you were to look at other other indicators, economic indicators demonstrate the same. So I think we can take that now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the point here is that I think this makes sense. This should have been done already heading into the holidays. We should exempt low wage, small pilot, I mean, exempt the smaller grocers. And I think this sends a clear message that that these are the types of policies that we think should help with an inclusive recovery'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so I'll pause there and council members and they answer, you go with that framework.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you for that. I know that the intent of this ordinance is definitely not to include our mom and pop shops that are barely making it, and we don't want to put an extra burden on them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The this item is intended to help those that have a lot of employees and that have a lot of profit coming in. So this this makes sense to set up friendly. So thank you. I will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, I have Councilmember Ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank Councilmembers and Richardson for their presentation of the motion. The chart that was up there is compelling. I think it tells the story that we tried to work through here. And I think the the the friendly that was offered is a good one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they told me, support the motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Mr. Mayor. So I appreciate all the comments tonight. And I was wondering, I'm not sure if there's someone from staff that can that can share on this topic or maybe councilman said they have. But I do know that there was a hazard pay provision in place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can someone maybe share with me why did that go away? And was it was it because it was temporary in nature to begin with? Thank you, Councilmember. I would like to see if staff has an answer with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it was. That's the question I keep asking myself is why did it go away? It made so much sense. So maybe city staff had to another end for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this this is Tom. This is not something that was required by the city. This was, as I understand, a negotiation between the employees and their employer. So this was something they came to an agreement on and was instituted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't really have information on why it went away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. You for that. Thank you, Councilman Xavier. Yeah, I. I have to say that I think our grocery workers are the most vulnerable populations right now. And and because I feel necessary to say this, I don't mean to offend any other essential workers or first responders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just really sticking to this item. So I hope really nobody mishear me on that. I'm not just talking about grocery workers right now, but they have a very, very difficult position and job function and requirement. And I know that I think about them with a lot of empathy every time I interact with them and see them'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And and I'm a worker that's an essential worker who's been reporting to work every day since March. But I have protections in place that are grocery workers don't have there are space and space requirements and distance precautions and things that protect me as an example that they don't have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think if they received it in the past, certainly the COVID crisis and dangers and risks have not gone away. In fact, they're probably worse now. So the same logic that allowed them to have it in the in the first place certainly has not been eliminated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I do support this item. The one thing that I wanted to ask council members in their houses about is I know that you had the sunset being 120 days after the ordinance is adopted. And I know you asked the city attorney to look at a possible language about an extension.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I think one of the things, if you're open to them also considering this is if if that the sunset could be tied somehow to the declaration of state of emergency in the city. And the reason I say that is they don't want it tied to the state, because as we mentioned last week, we may be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in a situation where we're differently situated from L.A. County or other parts of the state. And we certainly don't want to be lumped in in terms of the state of emergency. Our situation may be better, hopefully, or it may be worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think this the sunset on this, we might want to tie it to the declaration of a state of emergency. So for the period of time that we have a state of emergency declared in the city is when this additional pay would last until.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that to me, that makes sense because I know that we've talked about some of the other relief items that we've passed and we've set a sunset. We've had to reconvene and think about extensions. And that's always been very controversial each time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think if we if we tie it to the state of emergency, the assumption there is the safety impacts and the risk impacts are tied to the. And and not some arbitrary carrier that we pick. So I don't know if you're open to having the city attorney look at tying the sunset to the length of time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that this is a state of emergency in the city of Long Beach. And also, if we're able to think about, you know, I don't know when these workers will be eligible for vaccines when those become available. But it's reasonable to assume that it'll be several months down the road.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know. And, you know, not to not to put anyone on the spot, but maybe the city attorney can report back next week on, you know, when would we expect social hour grocery workers to receive the vaccines in terms of our timeline?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know I didn't prepare anybody with that question ahead of time. So maybe the city attorney can explore that, too, because if it's if it's five or six months out, then we want to make sure that we have a sunset that's reasonable in terms of actually protecting the employees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Councilman Sunday House, I hope that you'd be open to those two things, tying the sunset to the state of emergency and also evaluating, you know, when when these individuals might be eligible to get some long term protection through a vaccine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much, Councilwoman Price, for that. Those requests, I think that I absolutely understand your intent. BE It's one of the things that I was hoping for is to maybe bring it back in, you know, after the 120 days and maybe evaluated then and see if we can do that at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that right now, with things being as uncertain as they are with this pandemic, you know, I think that it might be best to just leave it as it is right now and ask staff to please bring it back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when we bring it back, we can evaluate both. I think that would be make the most sense for me right now, but I thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Price, did you have anything else?'",

Some of the highest rates of transmission in our workforce are, as we know, are among the frontline and essential workers, and especially our grocery store workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I personally been out to the stores. I have met with many of the workers, and I understand their fears and I wholeheartedly support them, support them. And these folks, they don't have a choice to stay home and they largely can't control the actions or members of the public and their personal space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even though we have a cap or control of how many people go in the grocery stores. These workers are in constant contact with the public and the burden of ensuring their personal safety is a stressor. We heard this and so many of the folks that talk today and it really spoke to me and it spoke to my'",
        "'speaker_2': 'heart and and I just I want to say, please be kind to these workers. They're under so much stress. So I think grocery store workers should have their hero pay reinstated for the risks that they undertake just to keep us fed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to my friends that are working out there on the front line as a grocery store worker. I am with you. And I strongly support the reinstatement of the hero pay, which by my calculations is about $160 a week per employee, which would make a huge difference to these folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not an unreasonable burden.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the employers. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I think that concludes the council comment. I'm just going to just add before we go to a vote, I'm very supportive of this action today. Our grocery workers are on the front line. They're working hard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been an honor and a pleasure to know many of them that have been there working nonstop to ensure that folks across our city and around our country have access to food and to all the needs that they have that they have in need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm hero. I was happy when they were receiving hero pay earlier in the pandemic. They should be. They should be receiving it now as well. And so I'm very, very heartened to have seen this come forward. I want to thank Councilwoman and De Hauser for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I want to thank, most importantly, the grocery workers and really all those retail workers that are working in these stores for their amazing work. So thank you very much. And it looks like we actually have two other folks queued up on the council side that they saw right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me get to them. Councilwoman Sorrow and then Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you so much. I want to thank Councilman Emmerson Day for bringing this agenda item forward with it and representing a district with the highest current rates. And we shared a district councilwoman Sunday. And I understand the risk that essential workers, especially grocery workers, take when they go to work and and the risk that they bring'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and bringing it home. You know, we recognize them as heroes during the very beginning of the pandemic. And they continue to be heroes working at the front line, as well as our many other essential workers. And in this case, I really think that we need to reinstate it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think they they continue to deserve to be treated as such, which is heroes. And so I support this recommendation to strike up an ordinance to restore the heroes pay. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm very supportive of this, and I appreciate all of our grocery store workers. I just had an additional question based on the comment of one of the members of the public. Mr. MODICA Do we not have any additional suggestions for our grocery stores related to added protections that the checkers can have built in?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know some stores have chosen to put up additional barriers between checkers and those that are checking in and out. If there is some information you can provide on that and or what we as a city could do to better protect individuals who work in the grocery industry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know on my side of town, I've been to several different stores that have that protection, but I don't think that it's consistent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So those protections are in the health order. They're pretty strict in terms of how they're supposed to operate. Plexiglas should be separating customers. They should have the ability to wash their hands every 30 minutes there. They are required to be provided a face mask and other things as is required or as needed to keep them safe'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and gloves and all those types of things. Some, you know, you might see a higher level at some stores than others. And if we do get complaints, if there is one that we know that is not doing those things, please let us know and we'll pay them a visit and make sure that they are abiding by the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'health order. So I think, you know, there's there's a lot of requirements for PPE. And then the you know, even with all of that, you still have workers who are in this environment, which requires a lot of interaction with a lot of people who are looking to buy groceries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Even people stocking shelves and helping customers and all of those things. Well, I hope that we can continue to support any additional measures that are necessary to continue to keep people safe. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilman's in D.C..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just wanted to say thank you to all the grocery workers that are out there and those who are who were brave enough to speak. And it just compels me so much and breaks my heart to hear what they're going through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to thank in advance all of my colleagues for supporting on this item. And I know that together we can bring forward an item that will not only protect our most vulnerable frontline workers, but also saved lives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's the end game here. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And with that, we will go ahead and go to a roll call vote.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'to implement. And finally, in terms of timing, to have this back to council before April 1st, because as we see the strategies to to prevent COVID 19 vaccination and other things arrive, the hope is, is that the health orders can be lifted and people can get back to business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in terms of the studies, I just want to finish on. We covered at the committee the research that is already underway, which will become the foundation of baseline economic, social and demographic information. There are actually five economic equity studies that are underway now funded by the City Council, this appropriation of Cares Act money, and that includes'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And I had some questions on that. And then I wanted to also follow up on specifically the request I made related to the remaining funds for small businesses that would be available to launch the support of reimbursement related to outdoor extensions that small businesses made to continue to conduct business outdoors.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'That's certainly a council member. That was part of the discussion last Tuesday night. We heard loud and clear from the city council that we needed to take a look at what CARES ACT funding we had possibly available to put together to address the restaurants and the particularly those that that have invested a lot of money to deal'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with COVID related costs and outdoor business activities. So we have put together a recommendation for the city council and the city manager is has been working with us to get that ready to go this week. We believe we will have a program ready to launch by the end of this week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It will allow for grants up to $10,000, depending on the costs that these individual businesses have incurred specifically related to outdoor business activities. So that would be food services and otherwise we will have that information available in, of course, a website, a press release and written communication to council within a matter of days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we hope that we can start accepting applications by the end of this week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I know I specifically discussed a very simple and easy process for these businesses to make sure that those funds are put out quickly. What does that look like?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that actually has been a conversation the first two days of this week between our different staff and departments about how we can make that as simple but also as accountable and provide the documentation in the event that we have a follow up audit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we do a we're keeping this this initial interest form simple. You also have to have an existing approved permit for outdoor dining or food services. So that already provides some really important information from those businesses that have provided that for the permitting process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then finally, we want to keep the documentation process very simple in terms of demonstrating which costs have have occurred for eligible expenses. So we've taken that to heart and we think we've designed something that will be very, very streamlined.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you mentioned outdoor dining, but any business that's pulled an outdoor permit to conduct business outdoors because of COVID would be eligible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So we have to do primary business permits for, for these outdoor activities. We have the parklets in the right of way and then we have these, these occasional event or, or apps that have been issued. So this would be either public or private property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And ultimately we're focusing primarily on food services, and that would include restaurants and bars and other businesses that have received permits for that purpose. Our goal, of course, is to target those first, because that was the direction that we received.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. My next question is regarding the CARES Act update memo that was released. I think my question is for Mr. Parkin. Mr. Parkin, the city council approves a budget every year before the October 1st deadline, and during that approval process, the Council approved specificity of okay, this department is receiving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This much revenue in measure a this much revenue in general fund this much these projects are specifically designated to measure A or measure C funds and so on and so forth. But when I look at the CARES Act update pages 11 and 12, I notice that some of the programs are concluding after the deadline.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it would be my understanding that we then as a city chose to utilize Care Act funds for eligible expenses, and then we would be freeing up general fund money to then fund these programs that were originally funded with CARES Act funding into the New Year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would that need an approval of the City Council in a similar way when we would move funding of a particular kind of revenue, funding a project that was approved by the council and then change that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember I'm going to defer to John Grosso on the finance director. I think he's been looking at how they can utilize these Care Act funds in the most efficient manner in order to continue some of the projects that we know are going to be necessary beyond the end of December.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then thank you for that. And Mr. GROSS, you know, I'm a big fan of yours, and I know that there are a lot of. Movement needs of money to make things available with the intention of the original plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just from a transparency point of view, have felt that every year when you bring forward these budget adjustments, even though they don't get a lot of scrutiny from the community because they are pretty complex, I do appreciate reading them and I think they are important for the transparency of the finances of the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do you believe that those are required and will that be coming forward in a future budget adjustment for a retroactive approval, or do you believe that's not necessary?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe Mr. GROSS is on the line. Mr. GROSS either. We may have missed him. We will try to get him back on the line to be able to answer that question. So in summary, the way that we have outlined our CARES Act and we have put that in the memo today and we also put it in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the requirement and when we came to council in July is we have some reporting mechanisms for the federal government to be able to meet all of the CARES Act deadline. So it's a process that was reviewed with, you know, and checked on other jurisdictions and what they were doing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's called administrative convenience. And it basically does a reporting mechanism to the state on how we're going to be spending our funds. And then we wanted to make sure that we are delivering what we brought to the council to be to be implemented, which is the full plan that was implemented in in July.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's essentially what we're doing. It is using the funding source. Nothing is not a net impact. It's still the exact same funding source and that is just the way for us to deliver the CARES Act program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I can tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member or Vice Mayor Richardson?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And at the end of this, I'll talk a little bit about procedure, but I want to I want to thank staff for this. This presentation. I think the intent here is to really be very high level about where we are in this moment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you have it's a great opportunity to use a fresh palette, new counsel, new presidential administration, vaccine conversations are happening. Now is a time where the stars are aligning to really focus all the work that we already have to do around one strategy to best position our city for recovery.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that the recovery would need to be balanced and inclusive. That means, you know, we look at economics and how economics impacts everyone, but also we look at the social aspects of recovery and the health aspects of recovery, how to make sure that over the next few months, the administer the vaccine is administered in a way'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that that is equitable. How do we make sure that, you know, we're concerned about the public health of our art? We maintain our concern, but also really are strategic about the things that are going to be important to the recovery, like the reopening process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've been through that process before. We know what we learn from that process. That's going to have to be factored into this, how we how we strategically figure out reopening. We also know some industries are going to going to be different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're going to change and never be the same. So now's the time to really think strategically about how we build back in a way that's strategic and investing. And in industries, for example, we know that there's equality mandates coming down from the state in terms of, you know, meeting the sort of automotive, the electric car sort of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mandates. And that's going to create demand to produce new technology and new vehicles. Where we have the history here in Long Beach, we have the ABC. The only Toyota body, Toyota manufacturer on the West Coast is in North Palm Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know we have the history of Boeing. We have, you know, in our aviation sector, there's been some construction and capacity to think about manufacturing. Well, how do we factor that in? We know there's going to be a federal package, multiple federal package, as well as a broader transportation moving forward act.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What are shovel ready projects that we can start putting forward right now and maximizing the impact? We know that we have more capacity now than we have before. We have both lobbies Economic Partnership, Lumbee Center for Economic Inclusion, a lot of capacity around racial equity, community groups that are doing doing this work on the ground today that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are would be ready in the new year to begin to have a discussion about whether whether an inclusive recovery recovery would look like. We also know that in the new year, we beginning to implement some of the work that took place over the summer around selecting a reconciliation initiative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That should dovetail into the idea here is this is an opportunity really to send a very clear message to staff that as we go into the new year, our economic recovery is our top priority. And, you know, the region is focused on recovery, the federal government is focused on recovery.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we should have a plan that really aligns with the region's plan and aligns with our federal plan on recovery. This should be delivered to our city council and by April 1st. So we're ready to go. And we should be working in partnership with Long Beach, with Long Beach, City State, as well as our partners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank the LBA, the nonprofit partnership in Long Beach Economic Partnership for submitting letters and committing to work with the city. Also want to thank the Economic Development Commission also for stepping up and talking with us about making sure that the update to the blueprint really is coordinated with this to where, you know, our top'",
        "'speaker_3': 'priorities are economic and social recovery, but it informs the long term and sort of where we go as a city. The last thing is a share of economic development. I know the council committee is going to change. This will be my last motion coming out of the eye of the committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to. Councilman, Vice Chairman, go. I want to make sure that I know you cued up and I want to make sure that I'm able to make this motion. You're okay with that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Richardson. Thank you. So those are those are my comments. I want you know, I want to I think, again, this is a great opportunity for us as a city to to focus on our comprehensive recovery. This is what people expect from us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the timing is right. And I think we really can position our city for a robust recovery. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So I have a motion by Vice Premier concerning the second by Councilman Mongo customary ringa.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mary. And I think it's very important that we support this report in regard to our recovery. And that's and that's what it's all about. We want to get people back to work. We want to get businesses open again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we want to do it in a manner that is going to address the issues of. That I brought forward with the pandemic, and we want to do it safe. So I want to point that we see all of this report making.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Count Women's and Day has.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're having trouble meeting here. And first of all, I want to give a big thanks to our economic and economic development team and to our economic development committee for bringing this forward. I think that this is this is something that is very needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this has been an incredibly difficult few months for city staff and for the economic development department, especially, has stepped up this whole year, not just on this item, but this whole year in a huge way to help our local and small businesses throughout this these incredible challenges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we heard in our study session last week and has and has been reflected by our continued spike in COVID 19 infections, protecting the health and safety of our residents must continue to be a top priority. And just as low income neighborhoods and zip codes representing communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by COVID 19 are nonwhite'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Business owners in the city have also been hit especially hard by this crisis. Just yesterday I had a conversation with John about the work that's been happening to connect the the black and Latino owned businesses with resources. And it's important to me that it's important to me that we continue and that we expand these efforts as additional'",
        "'speaker_2': 'federal aid is received and we begin to move forward towards our recovery. We can't just talk about equity. It has to be something that we devote the time and money to support. One of the primary messages I like staff to receive from this discussion is that we must continue to determine what are not white owned businesses need'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to survive and then do all that we can to get them the resources that they that they have. Of course, everyone needs help during this big economic crisis, but there's certain things that these communities are lacking. And so we need to really look at it in through the equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Latino community is especially important to me. And I hear and I hear and see the way that our business is and struggled disproportionately to others. What we cannot afford to see as a city is for this pandemic to permanently close all small businesses that are so important to our community while others survive that that any of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the businesses are forced to close is a tragedy no matter what it is, because people have poured their hearts and not only their hearts, but their life savings into their businesses. But it will be so, so devastating for the overwhelming burden of the hardship to continue falling on our entrepreneurs of color.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that these are sentiments that are shared by our staff, and I look forward to continuing to hear about the efforts around economic equity moving forward towards an economic recovery. And we we must we must make a plan today so that when we do get funding for this, we know exactly when and where it's going to'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So with that, I thank you for all the work that you've been doing. And I think, you know that the work is is also coming. The harder work is coming. So I look forward to supporting this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you all for working on this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I believe that the mayor stepped away so I don't have the phone. So guess what? We're just going to have to queue up. If you have any other comments, speak up and we're going to recognize you by voice until we until the mayor gets back there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any other comments on this item?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Can I make my comment now?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I, too, want to thank the Economic Development Team and committee for your hard work in getting us to this point. For myself as an incoming new council member. So that so we're able to continue to put people first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Economic recovery is a very top priority for me, and it's something that I've mentioned time and time again that is important to my district, that we ensure that it's inclusive and it's just an equitable. You know, the people and the small immigrant and people of color owned business in my district have really suffered prior to the pandemic'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and ensuring that they're able to grow and thrive. And the pandemic has exacerbated their situation. And so for that reason, you know, many other businesses in different parts of the city were able to set up Parklets for their restaurant and, you know, use technology to shift their business and to somewhat survive it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that everybody has had challenges in this pandemic, but I do want to make sure to recognize that it's been so much harder for the businesses in my district to adjust and even to survive and recover.'",
