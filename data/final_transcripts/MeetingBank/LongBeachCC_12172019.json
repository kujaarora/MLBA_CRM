        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, mayor and city council members. We will have our planner, the project planner, Alejandro Santos Lopez, that will make the presentation for this item this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the City Council staff is before you today to present an ordinance to address potential nuisance motels and hotels in the city and establish a review process for all hospitality locations in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In October 2017, the city manager directed the Office of Civic Innovation to coordinate an interdepartmental team to explore strategies to address nuisance activities of motel users that affect the quality of life in the city of Long Beach. The departmental team at that time consisted of staff in the city prosecutor and City Attorney's Office and the Departments of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Development Services, Health and Human Services, Police, Fire and Financial Management. The team subsequently developed and tested a Nuisance Motel compliance plan at six select locations as part of a nine month citywide pilot program. Staff presented the program findings to City Council in November of 2018 with a recommendation to develop an ordinance to permanently codify this program.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The ordinance before you today accomplishes this through four primary components. Firstly, it creates an interdepartmental city team, also known as the ICTY, comprised at its core by the Department of Development Services and the Health Department with additional contributions as needed from the City Attorney's Office, the city prosecutor's office, and the lobbies, police and fire departments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Secondly, it establishes a process through which the ICC can assess complaints against hospitality locations. Thirdly, it codifies compliance measures the ICC can enforce to reduce nuisance and or criminal activity at or near the locations in question. And finally, it is structured to complement the existing nuisance regulations the city already has in place.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The compliance measures included in the ordinance largely fall under three main categories security, health and practices or policies. Some of the sample measures for each are shown here. For security measures. Property owners might be required to install cloakroom and televisions at entrances, have gated property access or install lighting improvements for health measures, and may be pest control'",
        "'speaker_8': 'requirements. Additional measures to ensure clean and working facilities and to ensure plumbing utility improvements work as needed and for business practices might be requirements to maintain 24 hour staff on site and or post applicable signage as needed, such as for human trafficking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To provide a bit more clarity on how the ordinance will work in practice. The following flowchart shows a process to follow. Personally, the Act will review any complaint receive through existing publicly available channels such as code enforcement submissions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'From there, the ACT will review additional data sources including but not limited to calls for service history at the site in question and assess if there is sufficient evidence to open a case file on the establishment in question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If this is deemed not to be the case, the complaint will simply be filed and kept on record. However, if the act determines that significant issues are present, it will determine which of the available compliance measures, if any, will be required and work in tandem with the business to achieve compliance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As long as the business is in collaborative collaboration and complies with the improvements required by the ACT. No further action will be taken by the city. It is only when a business refuses to comply and or meet with the city that the city will apply additional enforcement measures such as citations or business license revocation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In conclusion, staff recommends that the City Council approve staff's recommendation to adopt the proposed Nuisance Motel ordinance as presented. This concludes staff presentation and we look forward to answering any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Constable Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'll be quick. Thank you for this. This presentation, all the work that's transpired over the last two years on this effort. Just as a reminder, this came out of a long conversation about the nuisances on Long Beach Boulevard, and we found that there's a greater citywide issue associated with grandfathered nuisance motels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The pilot was the short term solution. We described the ordinance as the medium term solution, but really long term solution is land use and updating the zoning to make sure that we're actually, you know, addressing outdated, underutilized motels.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That may not be. You know, conditions have changed. We may not have need for so many of those motels across town. So I so I certainly support this. I just want to say, you don't want to acknowledge that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that the article over the weekend about this highlighted a motel, a particular motel that was not originally a part of this, this pilot. And so that had nothing to do with the city. But I will say to that hotel, to that motel owner, you know, we apologize if that if that motel was highlighted there, it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'shouldn't have happened. And, you know, the press should have been more responsible and fact checking and before putting someone's motel up there. But I fully support this. This gives us an important tool to clean up some of our corridors, particularly Long Beach Boulevard, Anaheim.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Andrews, because it appears.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll keep it brief. I fully support this. I look forward to having some conversations down the road about, as Councilmember Richardson mentioned, land use and what role the city might be able to play as some of these motels might be deemed not necessary anymore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Catherine Ashton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. And I certainly support this as well. We have motels throughout the city that that need attention. I just want to be clear on on the definition of a nuisance motel and how we get to determining whether or not a motel is a nuisance motel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because as was mentioned by my colleague earlier, we don't want to paint every motel with with a broad brush. Tonight, there are some responsible operators out there, and I think we need to acknowledge that as well. So can you just staff identify and help us identify what are the triggers and what would be constituted as a nuisance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'motel?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So this might help to provide some clarity on the process. The pilot program illuminated that there's not a one size fits all definition. So while the program focused on calls for service and police data in general to kind of determine the effectiveness of the program, we realized through site visits and conversation with motel owners and operators'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that there's contextual factors that also have to be taken into consideration. And so part of the focus of the program is to not have a rigid definition or a rigid threshold and to leave it to the act to establish what may trigger the program on a case by case basis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know that there's many factors that go into play, such as proximity to schools, proximity to other motels and other sensitive receptors. And so it'll be open to the staff's interpretation and to work with motel owners and operators to remain business friendly with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, Councilman Sun has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to support such item. I think that this is a very important step and a very necessary step in moving in the right direction, especially because a lot of these hotels are in the first district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am happy to be able to support this item. Thank you to Councilmember Richardson Andrews for presenting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And there's a motion and a second. We have we have two members of the public is Laurie. Laurie Raimi or Yogi Patel here? Do they want to speak? Please come forward. Both. Please come forward. Please.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I oversee six outreach teams and we cover 23 cities. And one of those cities is the city of Long Beach. We work in partnership with the city's team. In this capacity, we place a lot of folks in some of these hotels, and I kind of would like you all to think about this from a different perspective.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We often use these motels as a form of crisis housing, bridge housing to get people ready to move into permanent housing. Sometimes people don't meet criteria for hospitalization, but it's a place where we can maybe stabilize them. We use them in a variety of ways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many of the folks that we put in these motels really don't have any other option. We have established relationships with some of these motel owners and they've been very open to working with us. They have our numbers. They call us when there's an issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We come out, we work with our folks. So I don't want that broad brush to be used on all of the motels and just to kind of look at them in a different perspective, because they can serve a vital service for the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Mr. Patel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. My name is Yogi Patel. I've been a resident of Long Beach since 1981. I run Colonial Motel for last 40 years. I partner with serious Long Beach to put the homeless people at my motel. Harbor Interfaith. Catholic Charity.'",

This whole issue came up because one of the councilmen had an issue taking the baby home and had to stay out of his or her house was locked down because of one particular motel luxury in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last meeting, we were all here and everybody were pointing at looks at him. No other motel was mentioned. If you guys ever record, go back and check. Next day, I call the Andrew. Then what's up with this? Because he is my councilman and he never noticed any problem with my motel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my motel was painted as Nuisance Motel. I am out there to help City to take people off the street and not create problems. But by doing this thing, by publishing our motel as a nuisance motel, we lost a lot of business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we had to make up for business by getting more voucher people here. So is that what city wants? If you want people off the street, you need to work with motels, not Gordon. You done wood paneled and all that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before going public, we should talk. What is the problem? If there is a problem, we need to solve the problem together. So that's what I'm asking for. I have contact with the city. If we need to move forward with the contract, I will need protection that down the line.'",

Going into District four, we did feel that it was rich and infrastructure and superstructure and served as a bridge between the tourist regions of Long Beach and the residential area. And then within District five, which we thought had a large residential population with over 45,000 residents and containing over 20 churches, as well as some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of the tourism staples such as the Long Beach Airport and Eldorado Park. And then within District six, they are a diverse population with unique culture and heritage. We felt that the commercial businesses were primarily positioned to serve the community members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In District seven with over 52,000 residents. The area had a lot of locally owned businesses that have the potential through community engagement to become tourism ready. I did want to note that due to the amount of individuals that we had for this project, we didn't have someone for District eight, unfortunately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going over to District nine here, and we just kind of showed that did have many religious centers as well as culturally diverse restaurants and parks such as Holland, which will be going into further. And then after speaking with locals in the community, we each did some interviews and we felt that these were the three words'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that stood out as what Long Beach residents felt. Long Beach represents capable of solving and diverse diversity, being our proudest attribute and what the community is most afraid of losing. So with that being said, I'll pass it on to Sam, who will go more into the input that we received from the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. In order to further research, we decided to go out into the community of Long Beach and interview locals of Long Beach and just ask them what they felt were some strengths, some room for improvement, and also the tourism aspect of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what we came up with was that they were split 5050. Some people were very for tourism. They liked the revenue that it brought, the different opportunities that it brought. And some people were very skeptical of tourism as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with this, we feel like we can kind of find a balance between the two. For a community vision we came up with, we decided to see that as one of California's biggest cities, Long Beach seeks to uphold its small town feel while maintaining its civic culture and diversity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city strives to deliver a high level of service to meet current and future needs for its locals, as well as visitors. And we feel it really captivates what Long Beach is about. It's very culturally diverse and it's like a melting pot for everything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, um, and here we have our competitive analysis and we decided to focus on cities that really thrive on tourism. And we came up with Huntington Beach and San Diego. And with these two, we decided to focus on things such as tourist services, accommodations, transportation, their overall destination image, and also their marketing and their branding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what we discovered was that Huntington Beach does a really good job at showcasing what their motto is, which is Surf City. And they they really do a good job at that. And as for San Diego, they do a really good job at advertising how culturally diverse they are and all the different things that they offer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they also do a really good job at they have a development plan specifically for tourism, and that was something that we were trying to kind of figure out through our research. We didn't really find something that Long Beach had that was dedicated to tourism.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So San Diego was did a really good job utilizing that as well. And for our SWOT analysis, some strengths that we found out was that language is, like I said, it's very culturally diverse, it's a melting pot. So it can we can really utilize that in order to market and brand the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we also have iconic tourism attractions. So the aquarium, the Queen Mary, all of our museums, all of our festivals that we have and we also have a very beachy community feel. Long Beach is very welcoming, I know, compared to others, other beachy communities such as Laguna Beach, Long Beach is very just welcoming to everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We welcome all types of religions, cultures and just types of people. And also we figured out some places on which have some room for growth would be definitely creating a tourism plan that's dedicated to tourism, obviously. And also tourism is centrally located, the one area mainly south.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So Long Beach, north Long Beach is kind of missing some of those tourism aspects. And it's also surrounded by other tourism hotspots, like I mentioned, Huntington Beach and San Diego. So it can sometimes be overlooked.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But with this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also created some product developments that Caitlin will take you into. Looking to new product development for the city of Long Beach. District One has the infrastructure in place to host a warehouse throw similar to the still craft and things we know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This opportunity would bring in small, diverse businesses that would include birdies, local artists, workshops, food trucks and a space for Papa John's. In District two, we have plenty of attractions, including cultural, historical and recreational activities, but lots of the time goes unnoticed, creating a centralized tourism information booth that includes local tours and what fun activities are there'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to do in Long Beach. This could create job opportunities for low income residents who are familiar with Long Beach, helping tourists enjoy Long Beach while creating revenue. District three focuses on the beach. However, our city is not competitive with other surrounding communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Creating a beach water park would make Long Beach stand out from the rest and we have the perfect environment as the breakwaters conversion. This would attract family friendly tourists from everywhere. Looking into District four, we have developed an enchanted urban arts sanctuary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is currently the undeveloped part of the greenbelt installing public art installations, partnering up with the University Recreation Department for volunteers and work experience could bring opportunities to US college students. This attraction could for any tourist craving a green experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And District five. There are over 20 churches of different faiths, and Long Beach could host an inclusive event in observance of World Religion Day, bringing in tourists from all religions to educate individual individuals on spirituality through demonstration music, art and cultural fit and District six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can showcase cultural history by developing a children's oil and Naval History Museum that that could be interactive and inclusive for all children and adults. Focusing on the Cambodian town, the food and strapping scene could be developed in a church or that highlights the Cambodian community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Looking at District seven before bringing in new infrastructure is an important to develop the area first following along Long Beach Beer Lab as a hot tourist attraction. But the surrounding areas are not yet inviting, asking district residents artists to assist in beautifying the buildings, making them more inviting to tourists, developing a quarterly or yearly meet the art'",
        "'speaker_2': 'artist block party could be unique to all new and coming artists.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why? You've got about 20 seconds left.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Well, quickly, about Districts nine, Long Beach has a historical back musical place where we can focus on bringing in local musicians who are here to come and visit Ella, who like to come visit Long Beach as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Also, you've witnessed long beaches potential, so attracting more visitors and creating more of a sustainable tourism plan. We utilize infrastructures and engage the community and thank you for being here. Presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you very much. That concludes the presentation and presentation time. There is a motion in second to receive and file. Thank you very much. All recalcitrant beach students and kept please cast your votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been a mango. Can't remember Austin or Urunga, but she carries.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. All right. Next one I'm concerned about for the first excuse me, public comment. We had three speakers there. Speaker is Donna Atwood. And that. And then we have Jerry Glenn, and after that, we have Stefon. You go in that order, please.'"
