        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you very much. We're now going to move on to the first item of business that we mentioned here, which is going to be item 16, which is an item about the Aquarium of the Pacific. Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report from City Manager Recommendation to approve payments to Aquarium of the Pacific for the $10.7 million balance of a $15 million aquarium challenge grant to be paid from Tidelands operating funds as part of the funding for the Pacific Visions Project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think are we before we begin here, I think we have a staff report first. And so, Dr. Schubert, we're going to let the staff do the report and then we'll we'll begin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Doctor, you can say their doctor should be very, very brief. So council members and mayor, the Aquarium of the Pacific, the Long Beach Aquarium is facing a dilemma right now. They need to expand for the demand that they've created.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we I'm not comparing the aquarium to an amusement park, but if you look around us, you have Universal Studios had to add things like the Transformers. Disneyland continues to reinvent itself and add things. Knott's Berry Farm, of course, Ghost Town and Camp Snoopy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with the economy of the Pacific, they're adding Pacific visions. And basically they're they're faced with an issue. And the experts and consultants that they brought on board are saying in order to meet your demand and increase your attendance and create new revenue, you need to expand and create a new opportunity for the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is Pacific Visions. Dr. Schaeuble and his team are going to walk us through this in just a moment. It's a $53 million addition funded almost entirely by pledged donations, ours included. It'll meet their demand. It'll increase attendance, meet the demand of the region.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It'll enhance the guest experience. It'll attract new visitors, not just new visitors, but donors as well. And it'll also maintain our position as America's premier aquarium. So we the big deal for the council to look at tonight is we have a challenge grant of $15 million that we were providing to the aquarium through Tidelands 100% through Tidelands'",
        "'speaker_6': 'throughout a 10 to 15 year period. We've already provided approximately $4.3 million. But in order to go forward, we were providing that as funds accumulated through Tidelands. In order to go forward, the aquarium needs to make a firm commitment on approximately the $10 million that's left.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have it's in your packet, a scenario on how we're going to fund that. We're actually funding in fiscal year 17, $1.5 million of that that's already been approved. Dr. Schaeuble, the check is released tomorrow. And then we also have refunded our Rainbow Harbor bonds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with the dollars that have come free from that, that'll take care of us for the last couple of years and at least $500,000 throughout the next six years. And we're not looking at any capital projects in Tidelands that this will be backed up against basically operations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And quite honestly, during the past decade or so, we've always had a surplus of about $700,000 in operations and title. And so that's the money that we would be utilizing to commit to this challenge. Grant So that Dr. Schaeuble and the team could go to the bank and know that it's coming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I'd like to answer any questions anybody has or turn it over to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The good doctor. I'm going I'm going to turn this over to Dr. Schaeuble in just a minute. Let me just also just to add to what the city manager said. So I just want to just, you know, take a little bit different also of of comments and just say that the aquarium is a, first of all, world'",
        "'speaker_0': 'class institution. And we are incredibly proud to have this not just a tourist attraction, but this is an educational center. This is an academic center. It's a a place that is rescuing teaching. It is a leading, leading place for science when it comes to climate change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just really proud of all the work, Dr. Schaeuble, that you and the board and Dr. Molina and just the whole board have been involved with on this incredible project. And so we're very excited about this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're very supportive of the work you've already done. And just look forward to the future of this partner. Incredible partnership and the, you know, the millions of of young minds that you continue to teach every single day to learn about our planet and to learn about being a good stewards of our environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you for your incredible work. Dr. SCHAEUBLE.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Anibal Maria Garcia, members of the City Council and senior city staff and city manager. We appreciate this opportunity to be here. I'm Jerry Schauble, president of the aquarium, and I'm joined this evening by the immediate past chair of our board of board of Directors, Dr. Mario Molina, who chairs the Pacific Visions campaign and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is a charter member and by a charter member of the board, Ross Hill, who service goes back to 1998 before the aquarium ever opened. And we're joined by a number of of our staff over here to my left.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And later, we'll be joined by a penguin and a talking bird. And that should be entertaining. Tonight, you as as the mayor has said, you're going to vote on a measure to approve the final 10.7 million of the city's $15 million pledge to the $53 million expansion of the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lola, our talking bird is programed, but she can be unpredictable and she probably has two responses depending upon how the vote goes. One One of them may be R-rated. So before you take your vote, my colleagues and I would like to make just a few remarks about the aquarium to remind you of a number.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of things about about it. We're coming to the end of the most successful year in our history. We will have 1.7 million visitors. We have 113,000 members. 13,000 from Long Beach. 3.1 million website users. 140,000 people who follow us on social media and 730,000 YouTube views.'",
        "'speaker_6': '500 million. Our reach through PR and advertising. We reach 1.6 million visitors teachers, rather, on the online PBS Learning Media, and we reach 110 museums, science centers and aquariums through our science on a sphere network. And we also have forums, lectures, workshops, and we broadcast a lot of these online to reach a very large audience.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Financially, this has been a, again, the best year in our history, $37 million in unrestricted revenue. We're on track to have the strongest year ever. Annual economic impact is more than $60 million for Long Beach and 160 million for Los Angeles and Orange counties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in the past decade, we've been able to invest more than $25 million back into the facility, and none of those dollars were city dollars. They were from the successful operation of the aquarium. And over that decade, we've been able to contribute $22 million toward the city's debt service and the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Within the Long Beach community itself, we have 1500 volunteers, 25% of whom live in Long Beach and those. Volunteers contribute about 160000 hours every year. We have climate resiliency programs for the city. We have a live program with Miller Children's Hospitals Hospital where they can talk to our vet when he's doing checkups on animals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We engage local artists, performers and cultural groups at the Aquarium of Cultural Festivals, and the operating company has never missed a covenant from the implementation agreement, which I'm going to ask Ross Hill to comment on in just a minute, because over the years he's been the primary architect of all of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we've never missed a rent payment of $2.2 million, and we've never failed to reinvest at least 6% of the operating revenue in enhancing the city's facility this year. We will exceed that by a couple of million, and since June of 1998, this has become the most distinctive aquarium in the country and perhaps in the world.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to give a little bit of context, I want Ross Hill to make a few comments. He served as chair of the board on four different occasions. Ross.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Jerry. It shows I'm not a very good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Recruiter that I kept operating as the chair.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But actually some of you may know, some of you may not know that the choir was originally formed as a strong partnership between a private, not for profit operating corporation in the city. And that has been really, really important because that's what's allowed us to raise private capital to help build the city's aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We couldn't have done that otherwise. And in this project, as Jerry mentioned, it's $53 million with 15 million coming from the city. We've been through several iterations in financing, and I think most of that predates this board, but it's called an implementation agreement because it is the document that allows us to work together but still meet the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'bond covenants. And that's a very complicated document indeed. As Jerry said, we've never missed a covenant and we pay the rent to the city and the operating expenses. So I believe it's become the most distinctive aquarium in the country with a combination of superb animal husbandry, our use of media technology and convening and in participating with groups'",
        "'speaker_7': ', talking about the environment and about cultural issues, as the mayor indicated before. I'd like Jerry to show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You some more highlights of that. And so some of the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Strength of that partnership with the community is shown on this slide. We have a huge number of partnerships. Mola, Queen, Mary, Long Beach Airport. I'll let you look at these. I won't read them all, but the list grows every year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have partnerships with local businesses, restaurants through our Future Seafood for the Future program that includes Parker's Lighthouse, King Seafood and Gladstone's. And we also partner with Molina Health Care and Boeing. One of the challenges is to make the aquarium accessible, since we have a lot of people in Long Beach who can't afford to come to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the aquarium, even though we are much less expensive than going to Universal Studios or to Disneyland. So we have a number of programs. We send 50% off coupons to all the residents. We have passes at Long Beach public libraries that people can go check them out and take a family of four to the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have the free nights that are hosted by the mayor and the city council. Every Friday night we have free Shrek Lagoon nights and we we participate as an institution in many parades and festivals across the city. And we support local charities through ticket donations, coupons and venue use educational programs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The mayor mentioned we are an educational institution and we are we're an informal educational institution and we specialize in lifelong learning. We have programs all the way from pre-K up through retired people. We get more than up to 200,000 educational visits every year, more than 10,000 from Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': '35,867 are free. 30,000 get served by our aquarium on wheels. If people can't come to the aquarium, we take the aquarium on wheels to them. We have the most extensive and diverse lecture system anywhere in Southern California that includes all the universities and colleges.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This year will end up with 42 lectures that are all streamed live. We have Aquatic Academy courses. The one we'll be giving in the spring has to do with sustainability. It will build on the strength of what the city is doing and focus the spotlight on the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we will have the National Academy of Sciences here to underscore the importance of what this city is doing. We have programs and events for teachers and homeschool families, and we do a lot with the visual and the performing arts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's another thing that makes us distinctive. The use of media technology in combining the arts and the sciences are among our signature programs. Pacific Visions When It Opens. It will increase the number of visitors by at least 200,000 in the first year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The majority of those will come from outside of the city, but they will spend money here. They'll spend money not only on parking, and that will yield at least a half a million dollars to the city since the city receives those revenues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They will eat in our restaurants, and we hope many of them will also stay overnight when it's when we expand. This new building will be an architectural icon that will attract people to Long Beach just to see the building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It will serve as a world class, educational and arts institution that will engage the public like never before, and it will tackle the planet's most pressing issues. It will be the most powerful platform in the world outside of the military, that allows the public to explore alternative pathways to the future and determine how our actions collectively will'",
        "'speaker_6': 'determine the future. We actually have. And now I would like to turn it over to Mario Molina.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So, first of all, I would like to thank the city and thank all of you for your support. None of what the aquarium has done would be possible without the city's support. This slide shows you what the expansion will look like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will be a glass covered building. It will be iconic. And I think people will come just to see the building itself, frankly. I'm very excited about this. You know, Jerry talked to you about our attendance. We are bursting at the seams.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This gives us additional capacity, and it will bring more visitors. More visitors means more parking revenue. It means more people visiting restaurants and local businesses. So I think this is going to be very good for the local economy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can I get the next. Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Press. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a short video we want to show you. It's about 90 seconds now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's no guarantee that you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Get somebody in with the trigger. This there's no green arrow for us. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our world has been a place of creation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Devastation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And regeneration.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For 4.6.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Billion years. The only constant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Has been change in the past few thousand years. Our ingenuity has led to incredible progress. But we've accelerated the pace of change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The impact on our natural world. His profound nature can no longer keep up. To solve these challenges. The Aquarium of the Pacific invites you to join us in creating a thriving planet. The Pacific Visions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Immersive experience.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Welcomes performing artists, scientists, global innovators and youth to participate in designing a sustainable world. There. Humans live in harmony with nature.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pacific visions will inspire.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That same entrepreneurial spirit. To ignite a Blue Revolution. We are a creative, innovative and compassionate species. The actions we take today will determine our tomorrow. Join us as we design a better future for all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I want to thank you for your time and the attention. And we have a couple of visitors we want.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To bring out bring out our visitors. And while we're bringing them out, I also I want to thank you personally. This wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the support of the city. And it wouldn't be possible, though, if we to create this kind of an institution in most cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're very fortunate to be in Long Beach, and in spite of what you hear sometimes and read in the media, it is not hopeless. We have the knowledge, the tools and the technology to create a glorious future, and that's what we're all about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you would like to will be happy to answer any questions from any of you on the council and if you'd like to have your picture taken with any of these animals. No. Did we ever get to it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did you ever teach Lola to say thank you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. He says it, but not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well. What is Lola do if it sees a shark? What do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You do? You see a shark?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Dr. Schaeuble. I have some some councilmembers that have some some comments in question. So let me get through those and then we'll go to get to the vote and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then we'll take some pictures. So. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. You guys are saying, all right, that's great. Let me go and get through this. I know. Council woman Pierce, you made the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I am very excited to have you guys here today. I remember one of my first briefings I had after stepping into office was on this project and kind of that question of what do we want to do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and this is something we as a city want to invest in. And I think your team and your staff really have demonstrated partnership and vision and every aspect we've made along the way around partnering in our parks or along our beaches to expand the great work that you guys are already doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You guys are your whole team is right there. And I just really want to say your team is are some of my favorite people to meet with and give them a round of applause for all of their hard work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think you guys did a great job of laying out the numbers, the economic impact. What is it going to mean for tourism? What is it going to mean for the city? I've had the privilege of getting to know a penguin and getting to know Molly and of course, Betty, two of our otters that you guys'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have. And one thing that was really exciting to hear is one of our orders that we have, the typical lifespan, guys of an otter in captivity is around 10 to 12 years. We have an order in Long Beach that is the oldest living otter in the world in captivity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That doesn't tell you it's about to be 20. That doesn't tell you how much people in our aquarium really care. It's we should be really proud to have a great facility like this. My mother brought me behind the scenes at places like aquariums and SeaWorld to try to enlighten me on what did it mean to be compassionate'",
        "'speaker_2': ', to care for those that couldn't fight for themselves. And it was really animals that did that in spaces like yours. And so I wholeheartedly support this investment in one of our city structures. And I really think that the city staff are doing the hard work to try to get to the numbers that made sense for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that Long Beach is just going to be better for all the work that you guys have done. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The second of the motion was Councilwoman Price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do I echo the comments of my colleague? And I want to thank you for your excellent work and the presentation tonight. I will say my my favorite part of the proposal and the budget aspect of it is that it will not impact any existing or future projects out of the Tidelands area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a real concern for those of us who fund many city assets through that that particular budget. I think it's a great added benefit to the city. And again, I'm very much looking forward to being a continued partner with the aquarium, seeing the great work that you do and seeing the facility open.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you so much for bringing in our special guests. The Girl Scouts are here tonight and they were so excited, I asked them to stay so that they could see the live penguin and bird. So thank you very much for being here.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'sponsorship of local events, the mobile aquarium. I think it's really clear people are proud that this aquarium is ours. And, you know, I you know, the part that struck me differently now than before was the part in the video when it showed the young person walking along the beach and said, we have to think about the future'",
        "'speaker_8': '. You know, my you know, my daughter loves fish. We only have one little fish, just one. We got a 70 gallon saltwater aquarium with one fish. And and I've got to protect that fish, because if that fish comes up missing, I'm going to be accountable for it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I totally get it. But I'm a you know, I just think it's amazing to have an asset. And I would say to the level of, you know, Knott's Berry Farm at Disney, like, we have that level of stature in our region to have that here is a real asset and we should invest in it and we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'should protect it because it's a community asset and it adds real value to Long Beach. So keep up the good work. You obviously have my support here and let's keep an open door.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And so I want you to know that your supporters are out there following what's going on and ensuring that this great asset that we do have will be held in perpetuity and that the city council, along with the city staff, know and understand what's what's moving forward and what that information is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for what you do. Thank you for those at home who said they would be watching to ensure that this was exactly what I said it would be. And thank you for for holding true to what you've promised the community and your donors, because that's very important as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Much of what I wanted to say already has been said. But I also want to thank you and congratulations for all your hard work at the aquarium and really your commitment to sustainability and environmentalism.

        "'speaker_3': 'I think you may also like to echoed the sentiments which are said here on the diocese, because the aquarium, you know, the Pacific is very visible and successful, you know, in our nonprofit organization I City.

        "'speaker_3': 'And that one visit a week is very important to my district. And I want to thank you so much for allowing us to do that. Thank you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. I, too, are supporting this this motion. Your aquarium on wheels was absolutely amazing. You did the first one at Hudson Elementary School and West Long Beach. We're very proud of that, that we were the first and continue the good work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I hope that you can expand that program to include bigger and better displays. Take them out to maybe a shark or a mobile shark tank. I wasn't scared. The bird. Thank you very much. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I just wanted to take a second while we have everybody's attention on the aquarium to say that our aquarium night is on the 19th and that the team here, David, and everybody, have been great. We are stepping it up and we're going to be doing a pledge drive for sustainability because you guys are making that such'",

But at the same time, the work that I'm always most proud of is that the aquarium is leading our efforts on the climate change conversation in the city of Long Beach right now, and that is so critical for the future of our planet and sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This community and I want to thank you, Jerry. You've brought together scientists from across the country to advise us, counsel and advise me on what's happening, what the issues are. And it's that kind of work that you can't put a price on that you're doing every day.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Please come forward on this item on the aquarium? Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly a commendable project. And I think we should also take hats off to former mayors Tom Clark and Ernie Kell. That champion had the vision had the vision back then to see the value of this and push this thing forward.'",

And then once we go through that presentation, I'm going to do I'm going to go back to the council, turn it over to the maker of the motion, Councilwoman Price, do'",
        "'speaker_0': 'councilwoman do council questions and then open it up for public comment. And then we'll go back to the to the city council. So let me let me just begin by saying that I'm really I'm really proud that we're at this moment as a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Successful cities like I think all of us know, have strong and thriving arts and culture across the city, whether it's the performing arts and it's the theater or it's music or it's public art or it's small galleries across across the city or performances or murals strong communities have and support the arts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm also proud that Long Beach has had a history, I think, of supporting the arts, but there's always more that we can do. And the key question that government I think should always ask itself in the work we do is are we doing the public good?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at the end of the day, government's in the business of doing the public good and that's what the arts is all about. I think the arts is all about doing and supporting the public good and expanding minds, making people think critically and really also being a huge economic indicator, an impact for a community as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The arts have an enormous economic impact across the city of Long Beach. They bring in millions and millions of dollars in revenue through ticket sales, through people eating at restaurants, through folks visiting the city. And they also do an incredible amount to actually bring people to want to live and interact here in the city as well and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are a provider of jobs. This proposal today started with a few years back, and I want to walk us through what actually happened. A few years ago, there was actually a blue ribbon commission on the arts. This was actually started back when Mayor Foster was the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That Commission on the Arts had a variety of proposals and some people that are actually here, a few actually sat on that commission, and that commission provided a variety of proposals. Some of those proposals have already been implemented into policy documents and into the city the way the city operates and functions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the key piece of that commission and the key recommendation was this proposal to begin a 1% for the arts program. At the time it wasn't adopted and it just was not something that had, I think maybe at the time, complete support or buy in from all the folks involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that piece of it got shelved. But it's always been part of the conversation when you talk to artists and folks that support the arts is bringing this percent discussion back. We we used to have a percent for the arts program in the city when we had redevelopment agencies and we had that program in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that, of course, went away when redevelopment was eliminated. And so the city again was left without any sort of dedicated public arts funding outside of the funding that we provide, of course, to our municipal band and to, of course, our Long Beach Museum of Art.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so last year at the state of the city, I was pretty clear, I think in in during a part of the speech that we had to bring back the percent for the arts. I encourage the Council to address it and to look into it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm incredibly proud that I think within a week or two, Councilwoman Suzy Pryce, who was the lead author on the motion, and she was joined by Councilwoman Lena Gonzalez and Councilman Dee Andrews and at the time also Vice Mayor Susan Lowenthal to ask the city to begin the process of implementing a 1% for the arts program'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for the city staff who spent many months doing research. They have studied and done research on a variety of percent for the arts programs across the country. They've talked to members and the arts folks in the in the community and have come up with a proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a that's an incredible, I think, first start and first step in this process. And there's a few things I just want to mention about about the proposal. The first is, of course, the key component of this proposal is the 1% proposal for all public or city projects that happen across the city that add 1% of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'cost of those projects would be put into a new 1% for the arts fund, essentially a bucket where all those dollars would go as projects happen across the city. That's part one of the proposal. In addition to that, and while it's not explicit in the staff report, I would I'm also going to ask the council as part'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of this adoption that we ask as part of the motion, the port and the water department to also provide the same 1% proposal through their funding of their projects that they do as well. This would add significant dollars to the 1% bucket, and they have their own, of course, process and they have their own system in place'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But this begins a conversation that those two bodies that we can move forward on. Also, while not explicit in the motion, it's certainly mentioned in the staff report. I would also ask council to direct staff today as part of the 1% proposal to ensure that we begin the next study on the private development piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you probably know, today's proposal is clearly and purely on the public percent for the arts long term. There are cities that do 1% on private development. That is, of course, is a much broader discussion that has to include the development community and our business community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the only way we can begin that discussion is legally is to have a Nexus study that the city would have to perform to see what are actually all of our impact fees. What are developments currently paying? Would it be fair or not fair to ask for this type of additional support out of private development?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because the truth is, is we need to assess what our actual fees currently are, and we have to do it in a way that's fair to to these development projects. And so, again, as part of this proposal, I think the Council should direct staff to begin the Nexus study so that this 1% for the arts program would'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be would begin today, can really grow over the years into something very special, very substantial, and provide long term and ongoing support for our our performing arts groups that we love and that bring incredible ticket revenue to the city for our museum and cultural institutions, for local artists, for gallery spaces, and all the things in murals that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are important to us across across the city. So that is the proposal that we have in front of us. I'm going to let staff get into the details of of where of how we got here. But I want to thank all of you for being out here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's a big a big step and day four for the city of Long Beach. So, Mr. West.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor, councilmembers, I'm going to turn this over to Tom, motorcar assistant city manager, who's done most of the work authoring the report. Thank you, Mr. Manager, and thank you, Mr. Mayor and Council. I think the Mayor did a very good job of introducing this item and in talking about the history.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This has been talked about in the community for a long time. We were given direction as staff early in January by the mayor and council to do a lot of research, develop a program and come back. And that's what we're doing here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I've got a presentation. We'll will go over some of the research we've looked into. We'll talk about the analysis, the case studies that we've seen. We've been asked some questions about admissions fees and whether or not that can be part of a funding source.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The mayor talked about the the Nexus study and the private development impact fee, and we'll cover that and we'll talk a little bit about the recommendations before getting to questions. So currently we do a tremendous amount of support for the arts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The mayor mentioned this and I want to put a point on that. We have a very rich history of supporting arts and culture. Just a couple of things to point out. Our Long Beach Arts Council has a $404,000 current contract with the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have $319,000 of support for the Museum of Art, $360,000 of support for the municipal band. And then we also did an inventory of all of our programs and projects that we do throughout the city. Some are directly arts related, some are more cultural related.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we came to a grand total of about $6.2 million of either direct programs or programs where arts and culture is a significant portion of what we do. So a large investment by the City Council in Arts and Culture is currently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we did some research and looked at some of the other cities that are out there and how they do a percent for the arts program. We surveyed the 30 largest cities in the U.S. and then we also looked locally in California at the 73 California cities that responded to a survey.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the results were that, by and large, the 30 largest cities in the country do do a percent for the arts program. About 86 of those that we looked at had an arts program, and 14% did not have a percent for the arts.'",
        "'speaker_0': '87%. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry, 86%. Yes, sir. When we extended that to California cities, though, we actually saw a different trend. Of the 73 cities that responded to us, about 41% had a percent for the arts program and 59% did not have a percent for the arts program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the questions we asked of the 30 largest cities is where do they get the majority of their funding from? Is it assessed on private development or is it on public projects? And of the 30 largest cities, the vast majority did a percent for public art, with only about 11% doing both public and private, and 4%'",
        "'speaker_6': 'only doing private. So we did a number of analysis on the city's funding sources. Obviously, this will be something that is designed to generate revenue. The city has a very large budget, but a lot of those funds are restricted for certain purposes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in our analysis, we looked at a number of different things, including the general fund and how a percent for the arts could be applied there. We looked at what are called our enterprise funds, where essentially they're funds that operate like like a business entity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We looked at our internal service funds that help support other city operations. We looked at some of our special funds, and we also looked at a big one where we do a lot of capital projects, which is our tidelands funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also did some specific case studies on cities in our area that do percent for the arts. There are some cities that implement this very effectively and we want to learn for some best practices. This is in your staff report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I'll highlight just three very briefly. Pasadena, Sacramento and Santa monica. Pasadena does 1% of hard construction costs on projects larger than 250,000. They keep it at a public arts fund and they exclude all of the funds that can't legally be charged.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Sacramento has about a 2% of the CIP budgets are set aside for artwork, and they currently have a collection of about 400 permanently installed works of art, and they do a lot of that to local and regional artists.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then Santa monica has a percent for the art program, funding art and public places and temporary art installations. It's 1% of the budget, and they exclude their enterprise funds unless they can specifically find a nexus to that fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So one of the questions we got asked was whether or not the city could do an admissions fee or an admissions tax that is sometimes used around the country where you place a fee or a tax on admissions to anytime you buy a ticket to a public or private event, and that could go to the arts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so some states and cities have done that. We are in a little bit of a unique environment in California where we have laws that that govern how and when we can assess those taxes and fees. Essentially in California, in order to do this, we would need to have a vote of the people, and it would be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a two thirds vote of the people because it would be dedicated specifically to the arts. So that's somewhat of a of a high hurdle. Alternatively, and we'll get to this in the recommendations we looked at, how can we further support the arts by going to our partners at the Convention Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They currently have a $1 fund that they assess on tickets. It's not with the exclusion of art programs, and that money is used to help support the arts through support and marketing and other types of support at the Convention Center for the Convention Center for Arts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we actually are talking to them and we'll have a recommendation about how to increase that to provide more funding. We got asked about the development impact fee and the mayor mentioned that earlier on is can we do a percent for the yards on private development and not just public development?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is a process for that as a requirement of development. The city currently does charge in park fees that is governed by state law called the Mitigation Fee Act, and it requires a nexus or a linkage between the fee that we would charge and the benefit to the facilities and mitigating new development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So an important question is how we currently compare. Development is sensitive to some development costs, and so how do we compare to other cities? We're currently in the 50% of the highest impact fees, but we're going to be doing a study of further analysis to determine exactly where we are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What are some of the other cities that are charging, whether they're doing percent for the arts and how we how and when we would have capacity to increase the fee through the Mitigation Fee Act. And so one of those important steps is the next study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next, the studies cost about 100000 to $200000 to complete. And the first step we're already taking in this process is we're engaging in a study of the development conditions in Long Beach. That is fully funded already and out to bid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that is going to get us a lot of good information on where we are in the marketplace to enable us to be able to take that next step towards the next study. And so that research is underway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So recommendations. Getting to the recommendations that staff have for the council to consider. We are proposing as staff a 1% for the arts on all general fund capital construction projects and then any other eligible fund. As I mentioned earlier, we have a number of funds in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'General Fund is the one that is the most flexible where that money can be used for just about any arts types purposes for the 1%. The other funds would all have to benefit specifically that particular fund. So I'll give an example of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The airport, when the airport does a construction project, we could assess a 1% fee for the arts. However, that money and that project and that benefit would all have to stay at the airport. So, for example, we could do a art project at the airport on airport property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You could not take that 1% for the arts, for the airport, and put it into a fund to support the arts citywide. You could certainly do that with the general fund and we'll talk about that on the next slide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those we would essentially assess this on construction cost exceeding $100,000. We will have all of our other funds participate to the extent allowed by law. So those funds would be dedicated to public art to benefit those funds and users.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a wonderful relationship with the Arts Council. It's a long standing relationship where they currently give out a lot of grants on behalf of the city from that 400,000 that we currently provide them. And we would look to them to try to keep the city's administrative costs low.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the Arts Council to expand their role and to be that conduit for the percent for the arts program and funding our goal. It's difficult to project because this is based on construction costs and and what our three year plan is going to be for construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're hoping to reach about $750,000 over the next three years combined to support the arts. So where would the funds go for the 1% of the general fund that is unrestricted? We would recommend doing 40% of that of the money that comes in in any given year for the creation of public art.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This would be tangible art out in the community, in our medians and along streetscapes or things that the public can interact with for public art. We would propose 20% for small grants to local arts and arts institutions. The Arts Council currently has a program that does small small grants arts for capacity building and supporting our local artist'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and for direct arts support. And then 40% where it would be for supporting the major art institutions that do such fabulous work in Long Beach today. Again, the Arts Council has already identified those in their current contract. They currently give grant funding to those and we would supplement that program and have the Arts Council fund those major'",
        "'speaker_6': 'operating, major operating groups that currently are performing in the city today or in the future. So further recommendations. We've worked with the convention center, Steve Goodling and Charlie Burton, and they've basically come up with a proposal where they are increasing the fund or that the fund that they have at the convention center, they currently charge $1 for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'every ticket that is non arts related and use that to support the arts. They have increased it to $3 the ticket. They believe that that's in line with the marketplace and that's going to generate an additional $170,000 for a total of 225,000 a year for to support arts at the Convention Center and help actually grow arts groups'",
        "'speaker_6': 'at the Convention Center as well, and do a lot of marketing citywide private development. We will continue to study private development first through the development or the development services study that we're performing right now and also looking for Nexus study and identifying resources for the next study as a feasible second phase for arts funding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would return that information with the Council to the Council. If approved tonight, the actual program would be developed through administrative regulations. We would create a formal program and then we would expect that formal program to be done approximately spring of 2017.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would work with our partner of the Arts Council to develop and implement that program. So with that, that concludes the staff report and we are available for any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go through the counsel here and the the makers of the motion, and then we'll get to the public after that. Let me start with Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to Mr. Modica for that excellent presentation. I know that the city manager's office has been working very closely on this item, and I know that they've done quite a bit of outreach with the arts community, and I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank the members of the arts community who are here tonight to support this item. I think this is a huge step for us to get us back on track in terms of the priority that art has or should have in a city of our size, especially with all of the other great things that we're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doing in the city to enhance what we offer to residents and visitors alike. I think our support of the arts has been dismal in in recent years, and I'm happy that we are taking a turn for the better.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank Ron Nelson, who's here in case anyone didn't notice. I aspire to dress like him, and he literally gave me the shirt off his back and he told me it came with matching pants, too. I said, No, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm okay with the jacket and the tie. And so this is kind of in solidarity for the arts. And I want to echo what the mayor said, that although some groups aren't specifically called out or enumerated in the staff recommendation or proposal, I think prioritizing art and supporting the arts financially, including the museum and all the other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'arts organizations and efforts that we have going on around the city is very important and I will always be a major advocate for that. It was interesting to see the presentation tonight and to see that 73 cities in the state of California have a 1% for the arts program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm glad that we are going to be joining those ranks. Hopefully, I'm encouraging my colleagues to vote in favor of this. One of the things that I think is a very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Important part of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Arts that we always talk about in our council meetings and everywhere we go is this idea of inclusion. And you don't really see inclusion demonstrated as profoundly as you do with the arts. Art is all about inclusion. It's about having a place to see things from different perspectives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there is no right or wrong when it comes to art. It's about accepting and it's about allowing. It's about freedom. Art is a very beautiful thing. And so I think as a city, our commitment to the arts and allowing the arts to connect our communities is is hugely important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we see today a lot of focus is placed on STEM programs and and technology and engineering and math and and these areas where we we can aspire to have better medicines and faster transportation, more efficient communication and lots of other ways that science helps move our society forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think art really gives us a reason to live. I know I feel that way when I attend an arts performance or see the work of an artists. It really causes me to sit back and see things from a different perspective, and I look to my right and I look to my left and I always see'",
        "'speaker_4': 'someone who looks different than me, who has a different background or lifestyle than me. But we're all united in our appreciation for what we're observing, what we're seeing. And I think that's a beautiful thing. I also have seen the value that art has had in our local communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It really allows people to feel a sense of connection to their community. It makes people feel very vested in their community, especially when we see art at the local levels. I, I want to talk for a moment about the breakdown of the allocation that staff recommended in their in their memorandum.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that. The aspect of it that I like is that this will be our first year administering this program under this new model. And so this allows us to make sure that we have enumerated an allocation of funds to specific organizations that I think are defined.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I had a few calls with people that said, well, what does this mean, establish arts organizations. That sounds very, you know, elitist. It's excluding a lot of organizations. It's not intended to do that. That's actually a designation that I believe as a grant criteria, which is where the from the Arts Council, which is where I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'believe the staff actually got that wording and those organizations. But I think that what that does is, is many of those organizations happen to be organizations that provide the biggest source of ticket revenue for the city. They fill theaters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They bring in people from outside the area. There are different categories of art. And I know I've talked with Griselda Suarez in the past about this. When we talk about our you know, there's there's the support of our our larger art efforts that actually bring people in from outside of the city and also people from within the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city to go and support. And then we have community art and projects and grants that are really designed to spur art within the individual communities. And then we have education. You know, we want to be educating our future leaders to pursue a passion and education in art so that they can be the future museum directors, the future'",
        "'speaker_4': 'symphony directors. We want young children to be aspiring not just in and STEM or math and science or technology. That's great. But if they have a passion for the arts, we want to be doing programing and giving them that avenue to pursue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when we think about arts funding, we really have multiple entities that we have to target and support. Our larger organizations are smaller community based organizations and then the concept of arts education. So I like the way that this allocation is set up, and I'm hoping that as we watch this process get administered and implemented over the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'next year or so, I would like to request, as part of my motion that I'm going to make in a moment that we come back in a year and or even sooner. I'm open to hearing from my colleagues on that and hear report from staff in terms of what's working, what's not working, how can we tweak it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'so that we can move forward, maybe change the allocations if we need to? The one thing that I am a little bit concerned about, and I communicated just briefly with one of my colleagues via email, and that is what administrative costs and things may go up as a result of administering these funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I know that that's a little bit in the weeds. It's not part of the item for tonight. But one thing I want to make clear as part of this motion is I would like a member of the city team to work closely with the Arts Council over the next year to help keep the administrative costs low'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and to help them establish protocols and procedures for the administration of these funds, such that they're on a path of success in terms of future years. I think the city owes them that level of support, and I don't want them to be in a position where their administrative costs are skyrocketing because they don't have the support to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'deal with basically creating a new model. It's not a model that we've had, at least under the leadership of our current council, and I want them to have that support. So my recommendation is to approve the recommendation. But I also want to add that we in a year, we hear back from staff regarding how this program has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'worked and and tweak it if we need to at that time. And that the city worked closely with the Arts Council. And I see that Vice Mayor Richardson has seconded that and I know he has some valid concerns and I'm going to let him talk to and I support support those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bless you. Support those entirely. So thank you, everybody, for coming out. Thank you for the great, amazing work that you do. And one thing I just want to say, we are very, very fortunate and I don't know how many other cities do this, but our arts community works hand-in-hand with Long Beach Unified to educate and expose every'",
        "'speaker_4': 'child in this school district to the arts. And that to me is the biggest gift. And I tell my kids about it all the time. There is not a child who gets out of Long Beach Unified without being exposed to the museum, without seeing the symphony, the symphony, without hearing about the programs that they have at CSU'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I'll be with their arts museum. I think that is fantastic. And to the extent that you want to continue to score points with the policymakers in this city, please continue those partnerships. Those kids may not ever get exposed to art without you seeking out those partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you. And I. I mean, my kids come home and tell me about it. And that's how I learned about musical theater. West was from my kids. My kids taught me about musical theater. West and I went to college here, and my kids taught me about musical theater west.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that education and that partnership with the school district is huge. And I want to thank you for helping make our city what we always say we want it to be, which is a diverse city where everybody has a space and everybody fits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And regardless of what district they live in, regardless of what their economic or financial background is, thank you for making it affordable and accessible for families to experience the arts. One of the things that Musica Angelica does, and I don't know who else does it, but we take advantage of it in our family is they have the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'family pack, which is incredibly affordable. You can take six people. And I think if we could encourage that across the board, some sort of a family option like that, that would be fantastic. So thank you, everyone, for being here and I will turn it over to the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman Price and Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you so much to staff for the presentation. The mayor for his comments, Councilwoman Price for their comments. I would say that, you know, I'm really excited to support this. It's it's you know, I'm comfortable with the 1%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I'd love to see, you know, even more through other other sources. But I want to I want to talk about and it's really core to me. In fact, you know, people may not know, but, you know, I did plays in college.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I consider myself a thespian. And and I did. You know, I won't say how great I was, but I did it. I went through the process. So I think arts is core to our city. It's core to the uptown renaissance is core to a lot of the urban revitalization efforts happening across town.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I expressed my support when this initially came the council and I'm expressing my support again today. And I just want to talk a little bit about the recommendation, the finer details, just to make sure that within these details, the values that we represent as a council are reflected here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And know I've had a conversation and we've had conversations. Me and the mayor, me and Suzy, about this. And and and it's all been positive. So in Category one that I'm going to talk about is the 40% to establish arts groups in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, I initially had some trouble with that. It seemed like a significant group amount of funds to a small group of organizations. But when explained to me that these, you know, these organizations specific criteria and they drive a lot of the economic activity in our city, I support that completely.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It places a focus on those folks who have a direct economic return. Our city. An example is the Long Beach Opera. I'm a big supporter of Long Beach Opera and they just moved their headquarters in District nine. And one of the first things they did was sit down with us to figure out how they can have a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'local connection. What I do think needs to be considered and we need to, you know, look at as we move forward is, you know, the you know, we have the economic activity that drives tourism. But art is a focal point in a lot of the local revitalization efforts in local districts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's thriving and buddy budding budding business and art districts that are happening in town. And I would consider those established programs already. They're actually accountable to city council in a lot of different ways. So I would want to make sure that, you know, staff looks at including some of these, you know, art based economic development programs'",
        "'speaker_8': 'because it makes sense, it makes a difference, it makes communities safer. It's placemaking when you can activate a vacant plaza or coffee shop or business district with art performing or whatever it is, it's a local tool. So I support that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And at the end of last, ask the mayor, you know, respond to some of this stuff. Secondly, the public art. The public art in the public domain, 40%, that's huge. Public art is tremendously important. But I think local context is everything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've tested public art in a number of different ways through, you know, redevelopment, other, other areas. So we have a little bit of experience now on what works and what works is engaging that local community. An example is last year we did a project called the Creative Corridor Challenge, where we partner with the Arts Council, did a'",
        "'speaker_8': ', you know, a call for artists, played it, placed an emphasis on local artists, work with committees of local residents, looked at data and identified some of the most graffiti targeted sites in our city and the most targeted well in our district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The most targeted graffiti site had 103 tags last year, and since putting a 200 foot mural on there has only been tagged two times in the last two months. So it makes a tremendous difference in placemaking. So I would ask my recommendation here would be, you know, staff should put some some sort of on this public art'",
        "'speaker_8': 'public domain. Art, you know, this public intimate installation. We should put some requirements, engage local communities into this element. I don't want to give off the perception that here at City Hall we're dictating what art takes place in other areas of town.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That should be driven by by, you know, local residents and local artists. And then finally, of the 20% for small arts, I think it's great that it, you know, gives the small person, you know, not the small person, but the up and coming local artists, an opportunity to participate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to make sure that we place in an arts equity lens on that and we make sure that we're not just investing in the same old folks, but we're encouraging new artists, new futures, and encouraging people to see art as a as sort of a pathway into engaging in their community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I would I would just ask again for staff to play some sort of a, you know, how this is disseminated as staff to create some sort of equity lamp. Lynn So those small grants are distributed, distributed equitably.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I would just ask, you know, mayor, mayor or council member if anybody wants to chime in on your thoughts on these recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Well, first, I think I know you and I had a chance to discuss these things earlier. And so I think I totally agree with everything you've said. And I think when you set these programs up, of course, it's you're you're trying your best to set a program up and then we'll make adjustments as we go'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and ensure that that everyone is included. So I think obviously, I think there's an interest that as particularly public on the public art piece, vice mayor gets done, that we're engaging the communities across the city, particularly those communities that don't have as much public art as other parts of the city, and ensuring that we're working with the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'local business districts, the local arts community, so that those projects are done through a community lens. So I think that's something that absolutely we support. And then absolutely, we want to make sure that as this program moves forward, whether it's on the public art side or on the or on the grant side, that we are looking at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it through an arts equity lens. And I'd like, you know, that turn I think is as important. There's a lot of smaller groups out there that do a lot of great work. I see Evolve Theater and some other folks out there and those that kind of work needs to be supported as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I appreciate that. And I think that as staff develops this, I think we move forward. And I also really like what Councilman Price said as far as the the one year review, because I think that gives an opportunity between now and a year for everyone to kind of gather, review, see how we're doing, get the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'port on board, get the water department on board, and then move forward with some, you know, some different recommendations if we need to. So I do appreciate that. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you and thank you, Councilmember Price and Vice Mayor. Put your name down there in Richardson for your comments. I think it's a great place to pick up. I agree with everything that you guys have said, and I really want to first applaud all the leaders and activists in Long Beach that support the arts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether or not you're an artist or you're someone that just enjoys art or you have your kid, that you're using art as a tool to teach. I think everything that that Susie said is pertinent and important for us to remember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have an organization called City Heart that uses arts to engage with youth and the homeless population. It really is the tool of equity. It's something that you can do art in your home with macaroni and rice, you know, or you can go to a fine theater like we have in downtown and experience art.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in the big question about supporting the arts is, is everybody I think is on board with supporting the arts. It's how we make sure that we're doing that in an equitable fashion. I know through lots of conversations with Griselda and other folks that this is definitely a lens that I want to also support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that there's a an equity toolbox that's out there that's being used with cities on how to govern. And it really is just a list of questions that we ask ourselves before we apply grants. And it's not saying that you apply them only to one group, a minority group, or a group that doesn't have funds'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It's about how those funds get gets used. And so as part of this one year review, I think coming back with a tracking system about where the where the dollars are going so that we can take a look at it and really ensure that it is not only citywide, but that we are encouraging new people to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'involved. Just last was it last week we had the Arts Park open up and we had several different artists come in that I had never met before that really livened up our district. And so I want to make sure that we continue to support groups like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The second thing that I will say is just that I think this is a fantastic job. I know it's long coming and fully support it. Want to make sure that there's transparency and that there's support again for those administering this and that we're really looking to make sure that if they need additional resources, that we're being thoughtful'",
        "'speaker_2': 'about how we apply those. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to thank our staff for a great presentation. I think it was this this this item and this issue has been very well thought out. I'm happy to see us moving forward with this commitment to arts in our city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe that the arts are part of our DNA as a city, and it adds to our unique character here in Long Beach. I want to commend the Arts Council of Long Beach for their their work over the last couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You guys are strong, you're diverse as a board, the leadership. And I believe you've inspired me and other council members to have confidence that you guys are going to work to do the right thing. And I think you'll get majority support on this motion.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'At least you'll get support from this this council member. Something was mentioned about, you know, tweaking it and going in. And, you know, I think we have to be very careful as city council members not to micromanage projects and programs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I like to comment about an equity lens, but I think that equity lens comes from the board, right? If you look at the construction of the Arts Council board and the leadership there has changed just in the last couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's what I mean about inspiring confidence from this piece of this body. I think the one year review will tell us a lot. Is it working? Where did it where does it need to be fixed? And at that point, we can come in and make recommendations to staff and to the the Arts Council on how to administer'",
        "'speaker_10': 'those funds moving forward. So I think this is a great, great leap forward. This is an awesome step in the right direction. I'm looking forward to continuing to work together with the arts community in the continued partnership for District eight and throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think this 1% program is our best foot forward to support and sustain arts and artists in our city. And although I do think, as it has been said also, it just scratches the surface, but it's a real commitment and a great step forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I'll be supporting the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to start by thanking the staff for a very comprehensive report. I know doing that much outreach and research from our neighboring cities and across the country is intensive. And I think that it's also important to remember that not all of those who invest in the 1% for the arts are cities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we also have someone here from Supervisor Hahn's office. The County of Los Angeles. Thank you for being here. Hey, Linda. The county of Los Angeles supports a 1% for the arts. And I think that it's important to recognize that they also have a model that's very successful locally and overlaps us to that point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd also like to say that in the one year report, I'd love to see that we include all of the arts funding, including the Museum of the Art in the Municipal Band and the leveraged funds that are combined to get that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So an example is Griselda and I spoke before budget hearings this year and we talked about how their grant is a matching grant and she committed to working hard to ensure that it matched new dollars. So for example, if they had raised in the prior year $100,000, the 50,000 or whatever it was that matched to draw down'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the funding in the prior year would be a different set then the next year because then it really helps leverage the grant for them to grow their donor base. And that's really important. And so I'd like to see when the one year report does come back and not only shows if we hit the 750 Target, but also'",
        "'speaker_1': 'shows all the other streams of funding and the matching. That was a part of that. Because one thing that I've learned very through reading so many studies over the last two years is how arts are such an economic driver.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we are talking about economic development. We're talking about bringing people into the community. We're talking about how they spend their money and the jobs that are related. And arts is a big part of that economic development. I might not be the thespian as Vice Mayor Richardson, but I too participated in those kinds of things but could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not make a career out of it like some of you of have the talent to do. And that's important because that's a huge part of moving forward. And then just knowing and understanding that this is a step in the right direction and that it's an investment more than a gift.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's an investment in our future and our children and the richness that is the arts community. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And we're going to now go to public comment. I know that we have some of our arts organizations and folks that are here that want to say a few words. So please come forward. We're gonna do public comment and we'll go back to the Council for a vote and please obviously introduce yourself and who you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'represent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Thank you. I'm Karen Deci, the artistic director and producer of International City Theater. And I am so thrilled that you guys are addressing this issue 1% for the arts because we've been talking about it for years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so my hat's off to you guys.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just listening to you, I have to say quickly, I have such a great appreciation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For more appreciation for you in your ability to articulate your.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ideas and thoughts about the arts. And and obviously we value them. But to hear that, you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do as well. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Express my.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Support and gratitude to the mayor and council for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The possibility of making this a new beginning. And I know it's a beginning step, but it's a beginning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and it has the possibility of igniting growth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For the arts and for our city. And I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Appreciate that you understand how that works as.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An economic engine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with so much development going on in our city, residential and commercial, I think that third leg is cultural. And they all work together and they all feed off each other. And if we're going to attract more urban dwellers, they really need something more to do than just shop and eat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. It. It all works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Together. And any sophisticated city has a vibrant art scene.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I know you address.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That, Mayor, and we are heading in that direction, bringing major arts groups to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The performing arts center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with greater city support and major marketing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Efforts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the arts, Long Beach has the potential to compete with other major cities and Long Beach benefits from its geographic position. And between L.A. and Orange County. And this can attract greater numbers of visitors supporting other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Businesses, restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And other cultural activities. And all this will add to the economic engine for the entire city. International City Theater is Long Beach's resident professional theater company, and it was chosen. Long Beach was the chosen home for ICG.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is where Sacheen Dhesi decided to start International City Theater, because he also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Appreciated the geographic position. And we've been serving this community in all nine districts with the award winning mainstage and education programs in all nine districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we've been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Participating in these discussions about the 1% and strategic planning for many years, and the future looks bright with the possibility for support not only for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ICT and the arts but for our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I believe this opens the door to ignite growth for all. And I urge you to support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I thank you so much for valuing what we all do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Karen. Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Honorable members of the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Elected officials, city staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak this evening. I'm Jim Pruitt and I'm the president of International City Theater. I want to affirm Karen's comments. I don't want to repeat them, but I do want to particularly point out I see t's effort and energy in support of children.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I particularly appreciate Councilmember Price's comment about her children appreciating art. I recently saw some art that her own kids developed and found that very interesting. Exciting. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me also affirm and comment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On the related ticket support measure. That aspect of this proposal, I think that is vital to fund and promote art in Long Beach. It does certain things in terms of providing the money to further promote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The use of hotels, of restaurants, of tourism in Long Beach. And it is a measure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That will be returned in terms of its investment multiple times through what it will bring to the city. People who will use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Art, who will enjoy art, who will help encourage those up and coming artists, as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As those who are part of established art organizations within the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with that, let me just conclude by saying this is a great start.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is wise to be cautious, to be thoughtful about controlling expenses. We do need to do that. We also need to do more going forward. Thanks so much for your time and attention. Thanks for your affirmation this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I am Kelly Lucero, the executive director of the Long.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Beach Symphony, which is celebrating its 83rd season. I usually have a speech that I pull out and talk about how to convince people that arts matters. And I would just like to say thank you that I don't have to do that speech tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is such a relief to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And live in a city that truly espouses the importance that arts and cultural offerings brings to a community. And I'm deeply humbled by your support and thrilled with your.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Investment in into our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my city. On behalf of the the board of directors, I just want to say we know that the City Council has aspired to provide more support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Over the years, but this is an important first.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Step in a much larger conversation that I enjoy having with you all as we move forward. I've worked in L.A. County.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in Orange County my whole life.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I have rarely worked with such outstanding colleagues as we have in this city. We I am so proud to work with the major executive directors and these colleagues here. And I know that the additional funding that we all get will go towards reinvesting into our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is something I'm sure we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All excited. And now we get to dream about not just breaking even and trying to stay out of the red every year, which most of us are doing. Trying to stay out of the red. Some of us with more success than others.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it's it's an opportunity for us to get together and actually talk about those extra dollars and how can we meet the needs of more children, be better educators, help invest in our town in terms of more education programs, more free community offerings, ensuring that we have equity and access with our arts in all areas of this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'diverse city. And I'm just incredibly enthusiastic and optimistic and incredibly humbled and grateful to you all. So thank you so much for what I hope will be your support of this measure tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker with the great suit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Talk about staying out of the red. Yeah, I'm in it tonight. So, mayor, council members and staff, I so appreciate the fact that this is happening. I'm not going to repeat everything everybody else said, but to have this discussion in this room with this esteemed body feels like a very long process to get here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's really exciting. And I think for me, as the executive director of the Long Beach Museum of Art, I continually hear from outside of Long Beach what what is going on in Long Beach? Because there's this real resurgence and a real authentic and a really ground based on upswell of the arts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the message that this is sending beyond the city, that we've all been attached to many funders across this Southern California, across the country. But I think that this really sends a message to those funders to, yeah, we can invest with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we can give the symphony money. Yeah, let's give that on the art museum, I grant it's going to be so it it really does send that message and it really empowers us as arts institutions to go out from here and to use this going forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I really appreciate everything you've all done and I particularly appreciate it. But, you know, third district. Yeah, exactly. So anyway, so thank you, everyone. And thank you very much. Sincerely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you council and mayor and city staff.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I echo a lot of what everyone has said already. But I wanted to just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Put a little give a little information about the Long Beach Playhouse. This will affect us greatly. The Playhouse, we're true community theater. It's very small staff and a lot of volunteers. And the majority of our volunteers are board of directors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our audience are Long Beach community members. So this is going to affect a lot of who we work with. And we're all very excited and we hope that we have your support tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello? Yeah. Sorry.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So growing up in Carson.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'In middle school when I was 14.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I got to go to Moola and I was hooked ever since they had the Diego Rivera exhibit there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if anything, the big thing I want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Say about this initiative is that, you know, we do promote, just to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Echo Councilman Price's comments, that we do tend to promote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Them a lot. And as someone who is a trained.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Scientist and engineer, the one thing I want to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Say is that it's in the arts that really drives that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Innovative and creative thinking. For me, the arts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Growing up in elementary school, you know, middle school, high school, it's what gave me access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To talk about access and equity.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, I'm proud to say that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My son over there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's in sixth grade. He's, you know, you know, he's in chorus and orchestra as well. He has his performance tomorrow night. So the district does a wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Job exposing our.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Students to music. So so thank you for this initiative.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor Garcia, members of the city council and city staff. My name is Kenny Allen, and I'm here tonight as a representative of the Advocacy Committee of the Arts Council for Long Beach and as a member of the arts community here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm here tonight to celebrate with you. I think this is a huge step forward in the development of Long Beach as a culturally strong and healthy city. And the investment being proposed in the percent four report being put forth tonight will benefit our city in ways far beyond just strengthening our cultural institutions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And investment in the arts improves education outcomes. It strengthens our local economy. As we've talked about tonight, it drives tourism, and it helps create a healthier Long Beach in so many ways. A couple of key numbers to pair with the stories that you've heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The arts improving education outcomes. Students with an education rich in the arts have higher GPAs and standardized test scores and lower dropout rates, which is a benefit that's reaped by students regardless of socioeconomic status. Students with four years of arts or music and high school average 100 points higher on their SATs than students with just one year'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or one half year of arts or music. We've already talked about how the arts are an economic driver, but I thought it might be worth mentioning that the arts are 4.2% of the nation's GDP, which is a larger share of the economy than transportation and agriculture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Attendees at nonprofit arts events spend 2460 per person per event on average, and it's twice as much if they're coming from out of town, which is a lot, means a lot to our local merchants. We all know that arts drive tourism.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But you may not have considered how arts also improve health care. Nearly one half of the nation's health care institutions provide arts programing for patients, families and even staff. 78% deliver these programs because of their healing benefits to the patients.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Shorter hospital stays.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Better pain management and less medication. This program will impact our community immensely, and I really appreciate how this is aimed at being a longer term solution and not just a Band-Aid to support the arts here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for all of the work you've done. I know some people have fought really hard to get this to happen tonight, and I look forward to working with you to implement the program. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening council members and Mr. Roberto Duran. Good live in the seven. He knows me. It's nice to see you. My name is Emily Quest. I would just like to tell you a little bit about my experience at the arts in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I went to see movies for 20 years and it's true. I have a master's degree and a bachelor's degree from Cal State Long Beach. One thing that I would really like to point out that I haven't heard here tonight, we at the college, we get these visiting professors that come in for one or two years or we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'get young people from Vermont or Wisconsin or from other places that are visiting for a year. And those people are looking to build their resume. They're looking when they come to Long Beach to apply for something through the Arts Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I saw was those those young people that are just very intelligent, you know, people that really have it on the bar while they're here applying through grants to the Arts Council. And they come here and they do something and they make our life great, or they just make a program at the museum rock and then'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they leave. And being an artist, I've lived here 45 years. I was born at Memorial, that kind of thing. We have to realize this long be it. Investing in the arts is not like another city investing in the arts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because when Long Beach invests in the arts, we get to take advantage of an international college program. So. That's also a point that you're getting. Like if you want to get something on sale or double your dollar or get more bang for your buck, you will get that from the international and national arts community in little bit'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I think you alluded to the arts. I mean, the arts college at Cal State, Long Beach is one of the largest in the country and graduates, more artists and almost anywhere else. And so it's we're very, very proud of Cal State, Long Beach and the work they do there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, everyone. My name is June.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am in District two. Hi, Janine. I am a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Local artist, community organizer and educator and I'm really excited about the 1% of the arts passing tonight. And I was even more excited to know that it'll be the Long Beach Arts Council that'll be managing this money because I trust the new team very, very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And something I heard a lot being said was about how the arts is going to be a huge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Economic driving.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Factor for our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Things I wanted to also remind all of you and Rich. Rex Richardson, thank you so much for bringing up. What's happening in District nine is that arts is such a huge means of violence prevention in our community. I'm really excited to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hear what's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Happened with the graffiti and being able to place murals in certain areas. And for myself personally, I work a lot with young people. As an educator, I do spoken word workshops and being able to give young people the opportunity to reclaim their stories is so crucial, and I may not be inspiring them to be actors or working'",
        "'speaker_4': 'artists when they grow up, but we're instilling in them the confidence to be who they are and also claim their culture and identity. So moving forward, I just really hope that all of the arts that we invest in is not just about producing something for people from outside of our city to consume or even people within our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city to consume. But the process of it within itself that cannot be seen is so important and is crucial to building community, which I feel is key to preventing so much of the violence that's happening. So as a community member, I hope that we that you are able to collaborate more with folks like us and that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can also let others who don't come to spaces like this know that this exists for them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And then I know I have our last speaker. They're going to close the speakers list and then so everyone that's in line will speak. Please go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, everybody. Good evening, Dr. Eric Garcia, mayor and all the members of the city council. I'm sorry for my voice, but I share my energy, my passion and love for the arts, provide good energy to my books to express my worth tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Lorna Moran and I live in the sixth District. I am the director of Data Analysis from Data Science 20,008. It is a group of day laborers and domestic workers that work together to produce a contemporary era and very old and traditional Christmas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tell those stories adapted to the situation in our community. Thank you for considering considering the Person for Arts Program. My company is a guarantee of their asking feel and because of them are impressing my network and creating more opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This year we were selected to participate in current L.A. Public Arts Biennale. I want to let you know, major and council members. That the Arts Council give us visibility as a company. We are gratefully grateful. I'm sorry. And immigrants and laborers, we have a place to go to and belong.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our work is important now and for the future generations and funding from this city make our children's culture is stronger. I am commitment to my community and with help from our council. I am now working an opening and one is small and artistic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A space on Pacific 20/23, the first of its kind. In my neighborhood, the precision of Arts program will help more residents like me who are artists and business owners. Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I love everything you said. So. I want to learn more about what you're doing. I loved everything you said. So we're going to be in touch. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Surely you saw. When I entered, gosh, high school. I was an artist. I went on to be a trained vocalist. I received the Liberal Arts Award for Bank of America on the night when I received my scholarship to attend university.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was awarded from an extemporaneous speaking. Those of you who have traveled, you know what Olympics with the mouth is. It's an award. A competition like any other competition. While completing a bachelor's degree. I taught culinary arts on the local college level.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of course, we all know that our two important. In order to connect the dots. I believe that's where we feel. We feel each other and we feel our communities. Do you know how many homeless artists there are right now on the street?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homeless artists are attending our universities. So while we were proposing a percentage of fees wherever they come from for the arts. And while we don't impose and require. Those who are recipients of these funds. To themselves. Reach out to those who are homeless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Artists. Singers. The movie soloist was co-produced here. And we received funds. But how many of those funds went to the arts? How many of those funds helped the homeless? Who are artists? Many of whom who do not want to be recognized as being homeless because being homeless is such an embarrassing plight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did read his theater on the university level. I went on to sing. If somebody needed was performing a wedding on yachts, I got some calls to sing for them. But I have found. When the rubber meets the road at the end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not the arts. That we need your cooperation. If you sit if I sit somebody over the corner for an hour, I can draw you. I can draw a sketch pen and ink or pencil. Charcoal sketch of you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I have found the greatest passion is to get people off the street. These artists are on the street tonight. It's 45 degree weather tonight. And some of these artists who were proposing funding for. Well beyond the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the percentages that we are proposing won't help them unless we stress more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Bouchard. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Brian Trimble and I am here representing the University Art Museum at Cal State Long Beach, which is in the third district. So we're very happy about that, to have such support from our council district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As Dr. Garcia said, the university has one of the largest public art programs in the nation. And one of the things that we see is that while we train them here, we have difficulty keeping them here. And we want those artists and we want those people to stay in our community and contribute to our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think this program is a step toward that. And I think many of us also agree that artists should be paid for the work that they do. And a program like this will allow organizations to pay artists for the work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, they're working, they are training, they are contributing to our culture. So I think that's a very important thing for us. And I just want to thank you again for considering this tonight, and we hope you all support it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next Speaker. Thank you very much. I've closed the speakers. I'm sure I can hear you in line. Okay. Thank you. The last speaker. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Everybody went as much as. Thank you so much for bringing this to the council. And thank you to the council members, to the mayor and to the staff that we've been working with to bring and inform you about this other options and other what other cities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I really want to take a moment to talk about arts equity, an issue that Vice Mayor Richardson brought up. We are definitely working hard on that. And I want to tell you a quick little story. At the end of June, right before holiday weekend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We worked with the county to talk about arts equity. And to date the county had nine sessions and they were so proud of themselves because Pasadena had 60 attendees at their meeting. And when it came to Long Beach, we had over 120 attendees for a discussion on arts equity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I know it's important and I know I've been listening and we are now participating in the county program with the L.A., with L.A. County Commission for the Arts to make sure that we have strategies and ways to increase arts equity here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're starting to implement those in our city through the Arts Council, and I will gladly share the information of how it's already how it's already changed. We've seen an increase in applications and in the diversity of applications for the monthly micro grants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I will share that with your offices. Lastly, again, I just want to say thank you for considering this and making Long Beach a thriving arts and culture city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Nick Speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Councilmembers and our city staff. My name is Tasha Hunter. And I just want to say, just all this conversation about the arts. Arts is one of my major passions. Before I even moved to Long Beach, found a filmmaker that would intentionally film here just because the access, accessibility and the importance that the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'value that Long Beach gave its art. So I want to say also that public art is very important, and that's the one topic that I'm going to focus on right now. We have so much public art, like vice mayor spoke about our our murals in the Creative Corridor Challenge and our Veterans Day Moore mural up in North'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach by how in part it's become a destination for our community and a landmark. And it's a special place for our veterans and their families. And public art such as this is very important and it brings value to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, the different arts art includes it's not limited to our visual and our performing, our design, our auditory theatrical and our literary arts and public art and artwork can encompass any of these genres, and it's freely accessible to our residents, and it can be permanent and portable and accessible and integrated into our structures of our communities'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And it must be equitable. And as the current president of the Arts Council of Long Beach, we look forward to working with the city manager and council to help create a healthy arts ecology. And a sign of a robust program in the city includes local artists engaging with the public arts program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Long Beach is growing with so many talented, creative people, so many of which people ahead of me have spoken about, that we are here, these artists are here, and they're part of every day and every part of the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we want to make sure that they're woven into this magnificent fabric. And we are doing the public good. We're doing our our public service with the arts. And then on a side note, art and education is very important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was an educator. I still consider myself an educator, K-12 and also college. And I see the difference that it makes. And letting letting students that may not think the same way that they're taught allows them or may not think or learn the way all the other students learn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Art helps open up a different streamline of education. I've seen that in students. I see that my children at home and I welcome it. And it's very important here in the city. And I want to say we thank you for this item and we welcome your support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you, everyone, for for your words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next picture, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is Nestor Moto Jr. Sorry for the sunglasses. I have an eye infection. Um, I don't entirely agree with the whole 1% for arts thing. I think it's a little too high in my opinion. I feel like one of the speakers pretty much summed it up perfectly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What? Think good to have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An arts program. What's a good to have an aquarium with penguins that are all nice and dancy and fancy to take pictures with?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When people in this city don't have jobs, when people in the city like can't even find a parking spot. When people in the city, like, can't even afford a night out. I mean, I get I get what this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Body is doing. I completely get it. It wants to diversify the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what's it good if these people can't afford it?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's a good if we have to walk three or four or five, six blocks to our house in the middle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the night? What's it good for us to get tickets on a constant, daily basis if we can't find parking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In our own communities? And this is a problem both in the first District and I want to say the ninth District was North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a problem in a lot of places in this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this board, this body has not done its job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A lot of you, if not most of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You or maybe some of you and people in the past have looked at this body as nothing more than a stepping stone for elected for a higher elected office. And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are tired of that. The citizens of this city are absolutely tired of seeing every single one of you run for assembly, run for Congress, run for state Senate. After you're done, you're not here trying to do a job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're here just trying to fill the seats. Look at your computer text on your phone. But in reality, in the back of your mind, you're literally shooting for that next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Office up there. And we all know that. We all see that because this community, this city is not what it can be. Like I said, a lot of residents in the first District where I live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Walk.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Blocks just to get to their car in the middle of the night. You know, there are tons and tons of like there was one this morning. There was shooting marks where I parked my car. There was a shooting a couple of months ago where.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A girl got killed. But hey, none of this matters, right? Because we care more about penguins. We care about. We care more about the arts. We care more about people. What the what they draw. What's it good if these people can't afford it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What's the what's a good if these people are getting shot down? What's it good if these people are dead? It makes no sense. Makes absolutely no sense. And the value of this community is not in the value of animals.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not in the value of arts. Don't get me wrong, I love those two things. It's in the value.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of human.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Beings, because without human beings, you cannot have any of those things you guys are trying to do. And that motion previously just passed. Anyway, I can't we can't do anything on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I would highly recommend that this board reevaluate its priorities because it has a completely upside down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mr. Good. The final speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Previous speaker have been very articulate, have made some very good points. This should not be 1%. It should at the very least be 2%. It's absurd to have it at 1%. I'm a full supporter of arts, period. In fact, if it were if we did not have such a recalcitrant mayor, we would have opera.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I suggested a year ago when this came up, playing in this chamber from 430 to 5 every Tuesday night when they were. We're not when they're in our meeting before that. At some point, however, I think we should take a look at be very careful when you're dipping into the Tidelands funds and or the port because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'you may set a precedent, understand where Tidelands funds come from. You may then have other cities up and down the coast since you're tapping into tidelands funds. Want to tap into those monies? So I do examine that very carefully.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would also to put your. Put your career on the line, not your career. But another way you can do this. And to show your integrity. Reduce your travel budget by 50% so you're not zigzagging across the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in fact, by the mayor, I would have the mayor reduce his by 75% and develop the art and put forward arts period. In this day of, as I said before, escaping, there is no need except as the other gentleman spoke, reference trying to build your political career.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those days are over. I don't know if you really studied the financial situation which the city faces. Another way you can also do it is. Reduce the absurd 20% elimination of the or cutting the tax occupancy tax that you're planning to do on the new otherwise commendable project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cut it down 50% from whatever that is. There's ample money if it's properly managed. The problem is it's not properly managed. And again, I would commend the former speaker for hitting the nose on the head where you've got to put your interest at the city and not at your political career.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know the mayor, as we can address that his political career is we know what that's going to be within within two years, he will be in prison. So he doesn't have to worry about his political career with the rest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The rest of you should heed whether the previous speaker spoke. Spoke about. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. Thank you. That concludes the the public comment. You forgot to mention how our attorney general is going to be in prison, too. I was waiting for that part. So I want I want to, first of all, thank all the speakers that came tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to go and take a vote. Particularly want to give a special thanks to the Arts Council, the entire board. Griselda just everyone that that worked very hard. There. As you could see, there is a lot of work that went into today happening and a lot of conversations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's an incredibly, I think, proud moment for this body and for the city to support this and look forward to more funding for the arts after after tonight. So thank you with that. Members, please go ahead and cast votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Congratulations, everybody. We do have we have one of our friends here to do a pet adoption. The timing was a little bit off. We're going to bring her down so we can get her adopted. And then we're going to go into the public comment and the Styrofoam issue will come up will come up first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. I know we have quite a few folks here for this item, and so I'd actually like to turn it over to them to hear them first, and then I actually have a presentation and then we'll go forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if that's okay. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She went to public comment for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we're going to public comment first. So if you have public comment on this item, please line forward. Line up. But there is there is a motion in second on the floor. And so, just so you know, there is a there is a motion in a second which is the item is presented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Please begin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor and council members. My name is Kobe Sky. I'm a second district resident environmental engineer, and I'm an appointee of the Long Beach Sustainable City Commission. I want to say first, I support the motion and it's really great to see several council members coming together on this issue in a consensus way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's really a lot of benefits that will come to the city of Long Beach by moving forward with this motion, especially for our environment and for tourism. That's really important for those two issues. But there are other benefits as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thought it was interesting that the motion points out that Conservative Council member and ocean lover Frank Colonna brought up this issue more than a decade ago, and it's been discussed thoroughly since then. Other cities, the County of Los Angeles, many other jurisdictions have studied this issue extensively.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The federal government has as well, and 99 other cities or jurisdictions just in California have adopted similar ordinances. So it should be an easy decision after so many years of study and after these so many better alternatives that are easily available.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This really is a nonpartisan issue, and I hope that the Council tonight will consider further directing the Sustainable City Commission and the Office of Sustainability to investigate options to make the ordinance even stronger. For example, promoting reusable food service where.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or connecting the ordinance to the new mandate for composting food waste. We have the expertize to bring these options forward to you and we hope that you'll make use of that. Long Beach can be a leader to other cities in the region.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can address our mandates for reducing pollution to our waterways and have a very positive impact for the whole region. I hope we're going to be jurisdiction number 100 tonight and adopt this motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much next week. Please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi there. My name is Gabrielle Weeks. I'm a resident of District two. I'd like to really thank the council people, the green leaders who have brought this to the agenda tonight. That's awesome. Tonight, I'm not really speaking as a Long Beach resident, though, but as one of the people who elected to run your Sierra Club for the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Angeles chapter. That's all of L.A. County, all of Orange County. Out of those two counties. We've already had a whole lot of cities that have banned polystyrene as often as some of them, as often as seven or eight years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're not reinventing the wheel. As Coby mentioned, we would be the 100th in a city or county in just California. Just California. There's already 99. So this is nothing new, nothing scary. Let's do it. Because we care about human health and the health of our wildlife and clean beaches residents and tourists want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Sierra Club asks Long Beach to join the 99 cities and county who have banned polystyrene packaging in California. Are you tired of expanded? Expanded polystyrene also called Styrofoam all over your beaches and sidewalks. It makes up 17% of our pollution.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just that. And these flimsy clamshells and cups are easily replaced with something that I got an Al Austin's district's. Are you? This is a coffeehouse in your district, right? Drink on Atlantic. I think they are. They are. Well, so there's a lot of our restaurants here that are already using no Styrofoam voluntarily because customers like it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as Koby pointed out, this was started over a decade ago by Tonya Ray as a ranga being continued by her husband, as her husband should do, finish his wife's project when she's too busy and Frank Alona and your district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So over a decade of studying Styrofoam, that's how we know it's 17% of our pollution. That's how we know how much of is it inside birds and fish that show up dead on our beach because of them? So we've been studying it for a decade.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also, according to the U.S. EPA, numerous carcinogens are found in expanded polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Including formaldehyde.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And benzene. These things have a lot of bad side effects, so even the US EPA is recommending people not use Styrofoam if they've got an alternative. You know, I love Long Beach and this is great. This this intersection of two of my favorite things eating out and the environment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm really hoping we can pass this tonight because as it is, I just go to a bunch of the different restaurants in everybody's district that I know don't have expanded polystyrene because it makes your coffee taste gross, I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what if we ban it citywide? We're going to have all the restaurants open to all the people who want to be able to taste the food and the flavor, not the weird chemicals. And unfortunately, as the hours ticked by, a lot of our members had to go home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They had babysitters texting them, and the babysitters needed to get out of here. But we still have a bunch of signs out there. Going to take a moment to anybody. Yeah, we had a lot of people at the rally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of people wanted to stay here longer, but their babysitters were hungry and angry. So with a lot of support for this. And thank you so much. Let's join those other 99 cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, Mayor Garcia, members of the council and staff. I'm honored to be standing at the podium tonight. My name is Katie Allen. I'm the executive director at Al Goleta, Marine Research and Education. We're actually the world's leading research organization focused on ocean plastic pollution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're located right here in Long Beach, and we have been here 20 years. I'm here tonight to share the results of a nine month study our organization conducted in Long Beach and surrounding areas in collaboration with master's students from the Brand School of Environmental Science and Management.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The overarching purpose of our investigation was to identify the types source fate of plastic debris in our region. The information was synthesized into action items ranked by their feasibility and effectiveness, so the full report can be found. We passed out some bamboo flash drives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you guys got those from the Clark, the full report can be found on those drives. If you're interested in digging in. After nine months of digging into the problem here at home, our researchers determined that phasing out expanded polystyrene was actually the second most important action item to implement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Immediately through our investigation, we found that expanded polystyrene makes up roughly 26% of the litter on our streets. The material has low market value, especially when contaminated, so it's not recovered as frequently as other plastics, like polyethylene terephthalate or high density polyethylene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since EPS breaks down easily, it has a higher chance of making its way through capture systems into our rivers and oceans. And EPS is also lightweight, making it transportable by wind and water. Once EPS enters our waterway, it continues breaking into smaller and smaller pieces at a rapid rate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our organization has actually been monitoring plastic accumulation on the Long Beach Peninsula since fall 2015 and expanded polystyrene is identified as the most common type of microplastic. By count, we found over 2100 pieces of expanded polystyrene in ten liters of sand collected on the south side of the Long Beach Peninsula.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're literally changing the composition of our ocean and our beaches. These microplastics soak up toxicants and maybe entering our local food chain. They become bite sized morsels for the fish, turtles and other animals living in our local ecosystem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Beyond that, the individuals in our community feed their families fish collected from this highly polluted area. The issue is so bad here at home. Our Oregon organization invites stakeholders from around the world to visit us to experience the Microplastic issue up close and personal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just last week we had over 35 plastic industry leaders and companies like Coca-Cola, Nestl, Procter and Gamble. Simply sifting through sand on our beach, we're quickly becoming the city known for Microplastic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you so much for your work. Next beaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Really? Hello. Try to keep this brief. Mayor Garcia, members of the council. My name is McDonald. I'm a freshman from Long Beach State University. Yeah. And today I'm here just to speak about my support to ban polyester, polystyrene and polyester in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So whether it be in the form of a single use cup or some kind of packaging material. Polyester, not polyester. Sorry. Polystyrene is one of the most littered pieces of debris found on our beaches. This is not without its consequences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Along with being labeled a possible carcinogen by the EPA and affecting functions of the human central nervous system. Polystyrene does not biodegrade meaning as these pieces of debris flow into the ocean and sit under the sun, they fracture into tiny bits called microplastics like stated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So once they're in the ocean, these microplastics absorb other toxic chemicals like DDT and PCBs, which aren't good, and fish and other animals mistake these tiny bits of plastic for food. And because they cannot digest these microparticles and the chemicals leaking into the animals bodies, they'll either die or pass on those chemicals to us once we consume'",
        "'speaker_6': 'them. So there are many other alternatives to polystyrene, such as biodegradable or even other recyclable plastics. And many other cities in this country, from SFO to New York, have already moved to ban this toxic plastic. And at a time when the issues of the environment are being targeted, we must do everything that we can to protect not'",
        "'speaker_6': 'only our environment, but also ourselves. And for these reasons, I hope that the Council supports this issue and bans polystyrene in the city of Long Beach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go Beach. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Vice Mayor Richardson. My name is Steven Johnson and I'm the water resources policy analyst for Heal the Bay. Heal the Bay supports the Long Beach City Council's efforts to eliminate the use of a single use play siren from its business businesses within the City of Long Beach's Sustainable City Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The second paragraph of the Green Economy and Lifestyle section begins. Ecologically and socially responsible products can help reduce our resource use as well as reduce our harmful impact on the planet. Heal the Bay couldn't agree more. And in the same vein, eliminating products that are known to have a harmful impact on the environment will work exactly the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'same way. If council members truly want what's best for the health of the environment, they should bite the proverbial polystyrene bullet and ban single use polystyrene in any of its forms. Drafting this ordinance is an excellent first move in this endeavor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last week, the city of Culver City followed in the footsteps of the city of Manhattan Beach, making it the 100th. So maybe I'll be 101. But they're in first and recently instructed their staff to include straws and coffee lids within their ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is sometimes the city of Long Beach. This is something that the City of Long Beach might want to consider when drafting the ordinance. Thank you for the opportunity to comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Love your bay. Good job. You guys do great work. Thank you for partnering with the city on so many things. Okay, next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much for including this on the agenda tonight. I was thrilled when I saw it and I've never been to a city council meeting, but I just had to come because this is the most important issue to me personally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just bought a house. My husband and I just bought a house in Long Beach. And this has just been the issue that they held me back from loving Long Beach. So thank you so much for considering it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I bring my lunch to work because I don't want to consume things that are in polystyrene and we never go out for Chinese. There's so many things we don't do because they're going to be on polystyrene and this would just mean so much to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Welcome to Long Beach. We're glad to have you here. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Just real quick. Student at Cal State, Long Beach. Same. Nice to meet you. Starring as primarily used in the production of polyester, polystyrene and plastics and resins.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now some exposures to human exposure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So these short term or acute would be results in mucous membrane irritation and eye irritation and gastrointestinal effects. Now, the National Bureau of Standards Centers for Fire Research did identify 57 chemicals that are byproducts of the released during the combustion of poly styrene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So a lot to consider. Hopefully we get your support. And I thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. City Council and staff. My name is Seamus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm a resident of the fourth District.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Faro.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm the chairman of the Loomis chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. We have over 300.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Members in Long Beach, and we've been working with you guys and your staff for many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On this topic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In 2013, I ordered 2000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of these postcards and we've been getting residents to fill them out and I've been putting stamps on them and hand-delivering them to you and giving them to you. And I know all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of you have hundreds of them. I'm sure you never throw them away because they're so valuable. But I've heard from some of you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That you really appreciate hearing from your residents and your constituents and even tourists. I send all the tourist postcards to the mayor. So sorry, Robert, but you're happy to hear from your constituents about what they believe. And they've been telling you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Get rid of the foam in Long Beach. It's important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to the postcards, we've been working on this program called Ocean Friendly Restaurants, where we go out and find restaurants in our community that have already gotten rid of Styrofoam and we give them a little plaque to put on the window, says.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ocean Friendly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Restaurants. We put their name on our website and we encourage members to go shop there because we think they're doing the right thing. And invariably, time and time again, I'll ask them, Why did you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Decide to get rid of Styrofoam? And they look at me like I just fell off a turnip truck.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they're like, Of course, you know why? It's because the ocean is because the environment. So they already have this figured out and they've done it on their own. And in that light, I want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To introduce you to the following figure, our Long Beach hero right here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Carson. Countertenor. Honorable Council Members. And I'm Eric Garcia. I'm just here to speak out as a local Long Beach business. I own two small restaurants in town, a coffeehouse and a restaurant about to open my third one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I voluntarily about 12 years ago decided not to use Styrofoam anymore. It is a little bit of a cost for a small business, but it's a penny per item. And if I can absorb it as a cafe, that really coffee is a business about pennies and every cup of coffee you really count every single penny.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I was able to do it and I'm still growing my business. So I really like for you to support this item and I fully stand behind it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker, please. Thank you.'",

But as an environmentalist, which I really think is just a survivalist these days, that's really the way I look at myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not really a tree hugger or anything like that. I'm just trying to try to make us aware of things that have to do with climate and environment, that type of thing. I'm here to say that it's time as a society to figure out ways to decrease our waste and really actually actually eradicate waste that doesn't biodegrade'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or is not able to be upcycled in some way. So I urge you to ban Styrofoam here in Long Beach. Styrofoam and plastic in general, as you all know, really doesn't go anywhere. It sits in landfills for 700 years or so, eventually leaching into our.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And as you might know, California has wants us to be diverting most of our 75% of our waste by 2020. And Long Beach. I think this is low hanging fruit. I think there are some some types of waste that actually just should be eradicated and we can actually start to comply with mandates because Long Beach, it actually'",
        "'speaker_1': 'isn't recycling as much as we should be. And we can actually get some of it just out of the waste stream. And as this restaurant said, I was going to say that to Styrofoam. There are there are there are alternatives that are actually just price competitive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think once we become a zero wasting city and we're finding different ways to do with our waste, such as like composting eventually and we'll be getting these types of alternatives to serve foam that can be composted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's actually just such a win win, because I know the mayor, you've signed on to the Compact of Mayors and you want us to be a climate resilient city. So I think things like actually doing things with waste are it's just it's just that low hanging fruit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we've got to, as a society, begin to think what we're doing with the things we're making that are ending up in our landfill. So I think that was it. Yeah. Thank you. Please Ban sir from.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Briefly some of the points that we went through when we adopted a polystyrene ordinance a few years ago. We went through actually pretty identical process that Long Beach is in right now. We had an initiative come forward many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was put on hold for a few years. We circled its way back with some community support and council leadership. That item came back, we did more research and we had an evening just like this one where we were at that juncture where we decided we talk about it now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we draft an ordinance, come back with an ordinance to ban this or do we not move forward? And the City Council decided to take action and direct staff to draft that ordinance. I highlight this as an example, just to show that this is not going to be a final process tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're just asking for you to authorize your staff to move forward with drafting that ordinance that will give them the time to look at the different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Options, the different components that can go into a polystyrene ordinance, and then that will come.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Back again for your review and approval and probably more public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Comment and discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you do hopefully become that 100 or 101st city that bans polystyrene. There were a few things we did in the city that I think will be helpful for Long Beach. We had good support of our business districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We worked with the districts, with our Chamber of Commerce outreach, with the community to understand what would work and what wouldn't for the businesses and the retailers in the city.

        "'speaker_4': 'Thing I wanted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To highlight was the outreach to the community. So while we agree that getting polystyrene out of the waste stream is important, it's a toxic material. Material.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've heard how it ends up on our beaches and our coasts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to protect our environment here in Long Beach, but we also wanted to help the retailers. And the biggest way to do that is encouraging individuals to take.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Action.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see. Councilwoman Mango has a great sampling of products up there, but what we really want to do is get people to move away from disposables and be reusable. And so encouraging folks to bring their own tumblers, their mugs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exactly. Things like that. When you're going out for your coffee, when you grabbing your drink and take out containers. So we did a giveaway in the city where we did take out containers and utensils. We had a bring your own campaign to educate people that it's not just reusable bags that you need to bring, but you need'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to bring your tumblers, your containers and your utensils when you go out to avoid that disposable waste. There's wanted to show that this is a very easy thing for people to do slip into your purse or your pocket and take that with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that Long Beach does become the next city to do this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we can help protect and preserve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our natural resources.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our environment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good afternoon, Mayor Garcia and members of the council. My name is Robert know tough. And I'm the director of Don't Waste Long Beach, which is a local coalition comprised of community, environmental and workers rights organizations looking to transform our commercial waste industry to provide recycling, composting and good green jobs for all Long Beach residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm here today to urge the council to move forward with an ordinance that to ban polystyrene in the city of Long Beach tantamount to don't waste Long Beach's mission is diverting waste from landfills, and that's through increased recycling and also through source reduction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that makes today's vote of particular interest to our coalition. As you know, other cities have banned polystyrene from the recycling programs because once collected, it's difficult to sell and easily contaminated by other materials in recycling bins, which makes it difficult to store in our recycling facilities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Furthermore, food, soil, polystyrene is typically not accepted by recyclers by recycling companies. It's not compostable and as a result it ends up in our landfills. And the end result is the sobering reality which was documented in a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is really kind of key and mindblowing, but that found that if we do not divert the current stream of plastics ending up in our ocean by the year 2050, there were by wait. There will be more plastic in our oceans than fish again by 2050 by weight, more plastic in our oceans than fish.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we also know what polystyrene has to do in terms of like just beautifying our community or lack thereof, right? It pollutes our oceans, our beaches. We see it in our streets and on our in our parks. And I you know, it's kind of less desirable for our residents and also for residents, for those who visit us'",
        "'speaker_6': ', like I have family coming this holiday season to visit me here, I'm proud to say. And lastly, given the in the political environment in Washington and given the fact that we have somebody who's proposed a climate change denier who may be the head of the EPA, we have to look to you one more than ever to kind'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of lead by example. And so, again, we are asking that you all take the stand for Long Beach residents to do this, to move forward with our community and to please pass a phone free LBC. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Mayor and council members. Thank you so much. Staff. My name is Kathleen Irvine and I am the president of one more City Heritage Association and also serve as vice chair for sustainability. Everybody's going to talk about the science behind this, and I think we're all very aware of the problem with the pollutants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that moving forward with this ban is really, really important because unfortunately, living in the first District, we see a lot of issues with trash, in particular Styrofoam, the food, a lot of the small food places use Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even though people know they're not supposed to, if for whatever reason, they don't seem to feel badly about throwing it in the ground. And of course, we all know where that ends up as well. The other thing that is important, I think for us is the first district is that we are right along the borders of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the L.A. River and as it develops, all that stuff is going to come down the river. If we do not make a stand here, then they can certainly say, Oh, well, it's not our problem. If we make a stand here and say, it's your trash, take care of it, I think that's really important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So please support this study and I'll look forward to the ban. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening. Thank you for hearing us out on this. My name is Donna Birch. I'm from the eighth District. I have a couple of things I want. First of all, I want to thank Al Goleta Marine Research for being here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I follow them like a puppy dog. They are doing seriously some of the greatest work of our time. So you guys, I mean, this is some serious, serious Marine research that they are doing and not just in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they've been doing it for a long time. Captain Charles Moore is like my hero. Anyway, I just wanted to bring up a couple of things that maybe didn't come to the surface. But these are the cities in California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These are just the coastal cities. Right. There's 99 cities just in California, but these are the coastal cities that already have a polystyrene ban. Carmel Carpinteria. Dana Point. Half Moon Bay. Hermosa Beach. Huntington Beach. Laguna Beach. San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Santa monica Seaside South. San Francisco. Malibu Manhattan Marina. Newport Beach Pacific Grove, Pacifica. San Clemente, Santa Cruz and Sausalito. That's compliments of the Surfrider from their website. Anyway, those are just the coastal cities that already have a ban in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The counties are Ventura, Sonoma, Marin, Santa Clara, Monterey, San Mateo, Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties. So there are some partial bans in place. So that's just kind of an overview. But the other thing I wanted to talk about or just to bring to your attention is what's happening in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Surfrider Association already has their own standards in place for restaurants, and they are as follows. They are the silver level, the gold level and the platinum level. And as the other speaker mentioned, the restaurants are given like a badge for adhering to these standards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So for the silver level, they have no Styrofoam takeout containers. Gold level, they achieve silver. And at least three of the following options plastic straws are provided only upon request. Takeout bags are provided only upon request. Take out beverage containers may not be plastic, including plastic bottles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Take out food containers may not be plastic. Disposable utensils for takeout food provided upon request only proper recycling. This is really important. Proper recycling and trash disposal practices are followed throughout the restaurant. Right. This is our big. One of our biggest sins, I think, in all of our restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for the platinum level. No plastic take out containers. This includes Styrofoam bags, tableware, straws, etc.. So the Surfrider Association has already set a great standard for restaurants, which I think could be considered when this does come up for a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In Long Beach, we have in those categories we have two platinum, we have eight gold, and we have 19 silver. We only have one in the eighth district. And that's there. Back there. That's Lola self. Think us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, I'm back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So again, my name is Dr..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Eileen de Banal and I teach organic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Chemistry at Cathy at Long Beach. So one thing I have heard tonight after a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that at the end of the day, in the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Manufacture and synthesis of polystyrene, it makes us dependent on petroleum. You can't just, like, whip this up over the lab.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And call it a day. Like you have to get the petroleum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And distill it and do all kinds of crazy things with it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But more chemicals in it, and then then becomes polystyrene. And then on top of that, to recycle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It requires also more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Energy. So if we're serious as a community about climate change, then we would really look into this study and go on with the ban. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honorable Mayor Council. My name is Luis Navarro. We have three restaurants here in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not in the business to tell people how to run their business. But about seven years ago, we decided.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To cut out all Styrofoam from our restaurants and we were able to make it work. It literally is a game of pennies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's something that can be done to make a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Big change. And I think that if you're in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Business of in the restaurant business, that is you do have that conscious choice to make a difference and leave a small footprint on the environment. And why not take that extra step and and become environmentally friendly?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Peter Hanna.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm here wearing two hats. I'm I, I run clean OLB, which is a beach clean up at the base of one of Paro in the second district. I live in the second district. I'm also on the board of the Friends of Bixby Park, and we run a monthly beach cleanup, our monthly park cleanup.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I do lots of cleanups. And so any data I'm going to offer you is going to be entirely anecdotal. But I think it's a it's my anecdote. So I can tell you in the six and a half years that we've been doing beach cleanups at Cherry Beach, we've picked up over eight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tons of trash from that beach. And that's not a terribly helpful measure, though, because weight isn't really what we're concerned about. If it really we're talking about volume and if we're talking about volume, by far the worst offender is Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you talked about just the they're all consistently and this is not just in our beach. This is in the beaches up and down the state of California. It's in the top five most found little pieces of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's what we find all the time. I want one of our volunteers. He likes to take a break and excavate one square meter along the wall by the parking lot, and he can regularly fill a bucket in one hour excavating underneath the sand full of Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, the reason this is significant is that once Styrofoam enters the beach, the only way it can be cleaned up is by hand. When you try to clean up the beach, you can bring in those big earthmovers and you can sift through a lot of sifting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you're only going to get the larger, heavier particles. Smaller things like Styrofoam can only be cleaned up by hand. And frankly, I don't think anyone has the budget to clean that, to really comb the beach, to get rid of that Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only way you can do it is by volunteers. And frankly, there aren't enough of us. So the only way to address this is to cut it out at the source. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for organizing all those cleanups. Appreciate that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Very much. My name is Robert Palmer. I live in the third district. There was a PowerPoint presentation emailed to city council. I don't know if that's available to load or what, but anyway, if it is, I'll continue on and tell it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not loaded or can't get loaded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's kind of loaded. Actually, why don't we go to the next speaker while we load that? Okay. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good afternoon, Mayor. Members. City Council. My name's Dahlia Gonzalez. I sit on the Sustainability Commission. I just wanted to. To thank the council members who introduced this item for including the Sustainability Commission on this. I know that when the mayor first took office, one of one of his transition teams recommendations, something that council member Pierce at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the time was on, was that we activate this commission, and I would like us to not only hear from the groups that we've heard from today, but I also want this to be a business friendly policy. I have a small business and I often hear in the environmental discussion that the business and environment don't go hand in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hand. And I want us to get get rid of that mindset. I think business is important for for economic thriving. I think environment is obviously very important for for everything that we need to live. So that is one of the things that I'm looking forward to, to working with this council on, and I hope that we can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have your support for this item. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right, Robert, I think we're basically we're good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My name is Robert Palmer. I'm with Surfrider Foundation. I've been representing Surfrider Beach cleanups for 17 years now. We currently have for a month. And I went out yesterday to Cherry Beach and I took pictures of the Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if I could. Yeah, okay. Here we go. It's it's all over the place. The problem with it is, you know, the regs come through. They do a good job, but you'll see pieces are cut there. But it just the breaks just break this stuff apart.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's a cargo container and and I took some pictures in the planters around the parking are around the beach and the parking lot and you'll see what happened. I got to start over again. I don't know what's going on here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pardon? Oh, that's all there is. Okay. But anyway, the bottom line on it is, it's it permeates our sand. And the only way we get rid of it is picking it up, like Peter said. So I definitely support the city council and hopefully you guys can come up with a plan to ban Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. And then I'm going to cut the speaker's list off here. It looks like we're the gentleman. That gentleman at the end will be the last speaker. Okay. And then we're going to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Carry their council. My name is Mike Murchison. I apologize for being under the weather this evening. And I'll start off with a caveat of saying that I love Berlin and I love Lolas. I go to both places very often on behalf of the the industry and the business d'arte on behalf of a lot of restaurants here in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Long Beach. I want to express some concern from the standpoint of expectations in initiating a band discussion tonight, directing the city attorney to draft that. It's not that we don't applaud the environmental industry. We all love Heal the Bay, the Surfrider Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's nobody in Long Beach that doesn't think the same way. What we're concerned about is process. And I noted way back because I represented 18 restaurants back then in the minimum wage discussion that there were a lot of restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's over 550 of them that are full service restaurants that were not involved in the minimum wage discussion because there was not the outreach that was done at that point in time, and yet there was already a process moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I'm here tonight to express is we're all about getting the stakeholders together. We're all about sharing the dialog back and forth. I applaud having the environmental groups. I applaud having the industry, and I applaud having the restaurants all together at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I'm saying is take a step back before directing the city attorney's office to enact this ban and draft it. Move it forward. Set a time line that you want for the Commission, sustainability or the environmental committees of the city to get together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we'll get behind that. But without that, you're missing a key component here. Tonight, you've heard from the environmental community. Terrific. How many restaurants did you hear from this evening? Again, love Berlin, love Lola's. But you're missing over 550 full-service restaurants, over 100 fast food restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a lot of dialog that still needs to occur out there. I encourage you to do that. I encourage you to take a step back. Think about that because there is a financial impact, especially a mom and pop places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Mayor and council people. My name is Wayne Murchison, second district. Um, the gentleman mentioned a lot of restaurants and just picking and going off of him and seems to me a lot of the fast food places have already been Styrofoam and their places are using just biodegradable stuff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, um, you know, once you do it, people are just, it's not going to be that big a deal. However, like a lot of other groups, we do do a lot of beach cleanup. And last time I did one just the sun, same type of pictures and I had buckets of Styrofoam.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it does it breaks down the the scoopers can't get it. You could literally, as one guy said, stay in one's square spot and dig up a whole bunch of Styrofoam. So we need to ban it because it just gets into our wildlife and everything and permeates our every life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're probably breathing it as well. So it's a good thing to burn it. To burn it. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, Mayor. Council members, my name is Bill Hickman with the Surfrider Foundation. And I was here five years ago when the city council was considering a plastic check.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Out bag ban.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of the similar arguments came up and ultimately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Steve Long Beach was one of the early adopters of a plastic bag ban ordinance that went statewide, as you all know, was passed by the state legislature in 2014 and confirmed by voters last month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are a lot of similarities. And Surfrider, we see this at our beach cleanups. It's one of the top items. And before we look at banning something, we look and say, hey, is this recyclable with polystyrene? The answer is yes and no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Technically it is, but it's not economically feasible. A lot of examples were given why.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think this is an important issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think there's consensus to do the final studies. I think we've been looking at it here for ten years and it's finally come to the forefront. So there are other municipalities that this has taken place and it's not a big hardship on businesses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not aware of any business that has gone out of business because of this. So there are success.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Stories and we need to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Look at the whole watershed and set an example here. In addition to the expanded polystyrene from restaurants, you should also consider the retail sales of polystyrene, the foam coolers, foam cups, things along those lines. Those are the items that we find out are beach cleanups.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, those are included in some of the other ordinances throughout the state and something that can make an increased impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A couple of the statements in the aquarium video early really struck me. Humans living in harmony with nature. The actions taken today will determine our tomorrow. The future generations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And how your actions can make a difference for this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And beyond. So please move the item forward and please consider strong language to be an expanded polystyrene. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hello. My name is Brian. I want to say thank you to the city council members and the mayor. I'm very pleased about the talks of banning polystyrene. My personal experience with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Little bit like local beaches and the fishing community. So there's two type of people in the fishing community, the ones who are economically well-off enough that they don't rely on the food. And the a lot of our people of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Color who go there to feed their families, who just have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Little economics means of getting food in other ways. And there's two people who go there. The people who can't. Who can say, I'm not going to eat that because there's this constant warnings of pollution levels on our coastal fish croaker perch.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm just really concerned for a lot of our people of color who rely on coastal foods like the fish who are getting polluted through small particulates like this that get into their bodies. And who have no other means.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Thank you for hearing me. My name is Samantha martinez and I represent the Plastic Foodservice Packaging Group. We're a trade association and our members include the manufacturers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And resin suppliers of all different types of foodservice material. The type that you're talking about today. Tonight, polystyrene expanded polystyrene, as well as the poly coated paper that I see up there and a lot of people have with their coffee cups, the biodegradable compostable materials, the rigid plastics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You get the point. Anything that's that's a single use is made by our folks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we don't want to see any of our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Products in the litter stream and we don't want to see any of them in the waterways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there are many different types of materials.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because different food service providers utilize different materials for different needs, mostly for functionality, for hot or cold, for sizes, and also for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fairprice as well as some of them are concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'End of life options and look at recycling and composting and the availability of those in their cities. But like I said, we don't want to see any of our products in the litter shimmer in the waterways. And we do support a lot of recycling programs, composting programs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Clean ups and educational programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we really don't believe that a ban is a solution because what you're going to find, unlike the plastic bag issue, you're going to replace one single use food service package for another that has environmental impacts when they're manufactured and has some end of life issues as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It would be great if we all could go to reusable and I encourage you to look at that as part of your discussion. But again, I would encourage you to have a longer discussion. I saw I heard two restaurants were here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I heard from the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Restaurant Association, the Grocers Association, that they heard from some of their members that they weren't aware that this was happening. So I would encourage you to make sure to reach out to some of their members. I do have letters from from just both of those organizations, but none of their members came mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to state that the State Water Resources Control Board acknowledged that replacement products banning and having a replacement product is not the answer. I'm not going to quote their whole their whole analysis. But they said any product ban enacted by an ordinance that would not reduce trash would not assist in achieving compliance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So basically don't ban one and replace it with the other. But we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Support this council looking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Into solutions of litter and waste. We think it's an important issue and it deserves discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we hope that you will include stakeholders in the community. Thank you again for for the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor Garcia, city council members and city staff. My name is Craig Cadwallader and I'm speaking on behalf of the Surfrider Foundation South Bay chapter and have handed out to all of you some documents that indicate that the Food and Drug Administration is changing its position with regards to styrene.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we often hear arguments that the FDA has approved the use of styrene packaging for food contact. And as you can see from the document, they are reevaluating that position. And I believe that's because the National Toxicology Program Report on carcinogens has listed styrene as a reasonably expected human carcinogen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there is evidence that the styrene leaches from the containers into the food and beverages that are contained. And we think that's a bad idea. 100% of people who have been tested have styrene in their body fat. I've heard arguments that styrene occurs naturally in things like cinnamon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I might also add that nicotine occurs naturally, lead occurs naturally, and we don't want those items in our body. So our position on polystyrene includes not only the litter but also the health impacts of this product. Expanded polystyrene is unique in that it is 95% air.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It blows around easily and very often doesn't even make it to recycling because it blows out of the containers. We also know that it breaks up into tiny little pieces that are nearly impossible to clean up. But the other forms of polystyrene, including oriented polystyrene, which is a non blown rigid item that lids and straws and utensils'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are made of, also contain the same chemical. And we would really like to see you expand your consideration to not only include expanded polystyrene but oriented polystyrene and do something that's positive for your residents and business health and help us keep the environment clean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very good to. It's obvious. I think it's obvious based upon the what has been presented here. You can't make an intelligent, definitive decision long term tonight that would be based in law. It's going to take a while to synthesize everything and come up with a strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the meantime, however, in the meantime, there is an opportunity. What you do is you can put forward tonight an action and put it in place. The next council meeting. Passing an ordinance to go after the slobs that throw the stuff away on the street, on the sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Start with a $200 fine for the first one. Double it for the second one. And if depending on the age of the person is under 21, they will wear a t shirt. My mother raised a slob. If it goes further, you'll have the record of the guy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The mother will wear a T-shirt saying I raised a slob and go after it, period. I'm very serious because it's going to take you at least a good six months to a year to put something in place based upon what you heard from the Trade Trade Association and if you want to do it effectively.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not so with play passing and updated or revised amending the city codes relative to the fines for acting as a slob period. It's easy to see them. It's easier to get that. And that goes also to the issue that I raised earlier on when the during the early on in Sydney relative to the city as a whole'",
        "'speaker_3': ', i.e. some of the union are going to have to work know some of the police will cite for that. Some of the parking people will say for that those people that are out on the street, a bus driver will do that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Now we're going to go ahead and go back to the city council. Starting off with Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you so very much. I know all of you have been here for some time, so I appreciate your patience with us and I appreciate your amazing words. And more than ever, I appreciate your expertize. You're not just advocates.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're really experts in the field of the environment and in what you do. And I really appreciate that. So thank you very much. So before I begin my comments and the presentation that I have, which I promise will be quick, I wanted to make some amendments on the front end relative to the item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So before I started, I wanted to just clarify that we'll be directing the city attorney to work with city staff to change basically to work with city staff on this ordinance to begin the ordinance. The second thing is I'd like to add the Environmental Services Bureau as one of the lead agencies in the second recommendation to help'",
        "'speaker_4': 'put together the outreach plan and work with stakeholders for education and feedback on this ordinance. And lastly, I'd like to change the third recommendation to read the Economic Development Commission rather than the Committee. In business outreach. So with all that said, I want to again thank everybody for being here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My office personally, we've been working with many of you for over seven months or so. And the agenda item before you as narrowly crafted and thoughtful to all those involved that respects not only the work of our city staff and respects the impact to local businesses, and most importantly, respects our constituents in their yearn for a better'",
        "'speaker_4': 'environment. And as you will see in our presentation, the item builds upon the decade of over a decade of research and studies that the City of Long Beach has compiled, including work with the Sustainable City Commission, which was chartered with our very own council member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Darrell Super not currently this issue has carried on through three different city council members and will seek to implement a narrow ban on expanded polystyrene or starter styrofoam to go with food containers. So we'll begin this quick presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Here's the issue, as we've seen, of course. So background, I think we've gone over it, but I'll just go over it very quickly. So again, expanded polystyrene is not biodegradable. It can stay in landfills or marine environments for upwards of 500 years, risking mammal, marine mammals and seabirds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Expanded polystyrene, also known as EPS used for to go containers in the food industry, is not considered recyclable because of the food contamination and is unfavorable economically. And as of 2011, the EPA's Municipal Solid Waste Report represented about 2.17 tons of waste, to which only 20,000 tons or less than 1% was actually successfully recycled.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now the expanded polystyrene negative impacts locally. How does it affect us here in Long Beach? I've become, let me tell you, a an expert sort of on polystyrene. I never thought I'd know so much about this, but I have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so EPS is the second most abundant form of marine debris, as we've heard many times. Long Beach, we conduct over 100 cleanups or so a year. And if the Environmental Services Bureau is involved, it's about 800 to $1000 per cleanup that we're at is costing the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'EPS has health risk associated with the carcinogen styrene as we we heard as well Granada Beach according to Heal the Bay received a beach bomber grade F during wet weather months for poor water quality due to trash, debris and toxicity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And lastly, the EPA says the leading cause of litter in the form of takeaways. 40% of trash collected near the 17 freeway and the S.R. 47 is from the city of Long Beach. Now I want to clarify the item because I know a lot of questions have been asked about what are you banning, what are you proposing'",
        "'speaker_4': ', what does this mean, what are you doing, not doing, etc.. So requesting this, what I'm trying to do is requesting the city staff, city manager to direct the city attorney to work with city staff and draft language for an ordinance that bans the distribution of expanded polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that includes plates, bowls, trays, cups, wrapping. You get it? This is a ban similar to Pasadena who passed theirs back in May. This includes foamed number six, also referred to as Styrofoam as we've seen. And it does not include.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this policy is not including polystyrene, the solid type, which is a plastic utensils, and it's not including the retail sales. So some of the key points to note from the city of Pasadena that had just passed back in May, similar to that city, it provides a one year phased approach to allow for business and public education'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to the businesses in public. And it also provides a hardship waiver to businesses as well. So if for any reason they can prove that this is going to be a struggle for them, it would be taken by a case by case method.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lastly, the education piece in the agenda item also discusses the Environmental Services Bureau working with in conjunction with the Office of Sustainability and our Commission for an Educational Campaign. Lastly, Big Business Progress. The Economic Development Commission would work to reach research business incentives and also see how they can bolster our green business program, which we currently have'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But perhaps we can do a bit more. Now getting specific on the city recommendations because as we've mentioned, this is over a decade's worth of work. And specifically, this is from our former city manager, Jerry Miller. He says litter problem resulting from polystyrene foam food packaging is becoming increasingly difficult to manage and has costly negative implications.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The recommendations he made at that time were to eliminate polystyrene foam in municipal facilities and city sponsored events and to revise the city's purchasing policy to include language prohibiting the use of polystyrene. And then 27 also by our then director of planning and building, Suzanne Frick, and then acting director Chris Garner of Public Works.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's they both said expanding expanded polystyrene is not easily recycled and currently the recycling process is not financially feasible. In that report in which they worked with many stakeholders, including DART and the Grocers Association and including stakeholders on the environmental side, including dozens of businesses back in 2007, they came up with the recommendation four different recommendations, which'",
        "'speaker_4': 'again reiterated to create an expanded polystyrene reduction program, create a green business designation program, ban expanded polystyrene at all city buildings and events. And the fourth, what do you know? City wide expanded polystyrene ban. So this is just a timeline of what has been done since 2005.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Frank Colonna was involved. He initiated it. It was actually implemented by council member Tony Saranga in 2008 motion by her. Then we also did the single use plastic bag ban back in 2011. And now here we are revisiting the ban on expanded polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just some cast comparisons. This is on the San Jose's website for sustainability. And I chose this because it gives you a good example of the options the IPS, fiber, plastic and paper options that are available to businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in some cases, the cost differentials are cost neutral, and in some cases they are $0.01 cost difference depending on the unit that you purchase. So it's very different. I know with every different business people are purchasing a little bit more expensive material.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe some people are purchasing paper or whatever it might be. I know there might be a cost impact, but what that will be will be dependent, of course, on the business. But really, relative to what you're seeing here and what is mostly used, you can see the cost differential could be very low.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then California cities. So as I mentioned, we could be the 100th city to ban polystyrene. And this would be a ban, of course, a partial ban. This is not fully banning anything. You can see the cities that have partially banned in government facilities, partially banned polystyrene.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just in what we're doing for retail locations or for restaurant locations. And then lastly, a partial ban I'm sorry, a full ban that would include retail sales. And so this is just a blip that I'll Goleta shared with us relative to the EPS impact for businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the average cost of a $20 meal and an estimate that 20% of meals are carried out, which means that there are 55,000 meals. Then this average restaurant uses 11,000 takeout containers per year, which translates to 550 of EPS that can be replaced with compostable alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's it. I wanted to make sure we had some information. I'm happy to share this with my council colleagues. I will reiterate. To everyone that again, this is just an action that will begin the process to of course, we'd like to start the ordinance process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It gives us 120 days to think about the options and what we can emulate, similar to Pasadena or some some other cities that are doing the same thing or have already implemented what we want to. And for example, you know, working with our partners in labor and in business and making sure that we get it right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's the best vision for Long Beach is certainly most important. And I also want to note that, you know, we just sat here in the council meeting just approving a $10 million payment for one of the leaders in sustainability for the aquarium.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so as leaders, I feel personally that we need to be consistent in making sure that if we're going to do that, then why can't we ban polystyrene, a partial ban? We're not going from 0 to 1000. We're going from 0 to 100.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think many of these individuals are experts here. Again, they're not just speaking from emotion, they're speaking from expertize and research. And I really appreciate that. And again, we've also unanimously supported climate change actions, lower L.A. River plans, we've breakwater discussions, recreation on our waterways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the only letters of support or the letters of support that I receive were over well over 200 in my office. The only ones that brought up concerns were Dart Grocers Association and the California Restaurant Association. Only those three out of the people here today, we had about 26 people in support and about three in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So again, I asked my council colleagues to really think about the work that's been done. Let's be respectful of that. It does take more money and it costs to do another study. I think we've already done that. The time is now to get this done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I just want to say what a great job Councilmember Gonzales just did presenting that. I think that you've said everything that I had cued up and highlighted, ready to say, knowing that you were going to touch on, but and not such great detail.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to thank everybody that came out and stayed out tonight and not just tonight. People in this room, as she mentioned, have been working on this for over a decade. And I think there are two questions in front of us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is, what kind of city do we want to be for our children, for the environment? And Long Beach continues to talk about being a sustainable city. Right. We've had the commission my commissioner met with me. Kobe presented the sustainability plan where we look at in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was already done and part of your proposal was to ban Styrofoam. You've already done this and you've done it time and time again. Those are public meetings that are people are know are out there. And I think the second question is, outside of the environment, what other waste are we doing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're wasting a lot of time kicking the trash down the road and not tackling it whenever people continue to say they want it. And I know that you guys are volunteers. I know the people that are out there cleaning our beaches, picking up every piece of Styrofoam, is a volunteer working and taking time away from their family'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to do that. And so I believe that what Councilmember Gonzalez has done has laid out a great path to get to what we've all said we wanted to get to by directing the city attorney to say, let's draft an ordinance but have process in there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to ask a question of the city attorney in the process when it says work with the Office of Sustainability, the Sustainability City Commission, community stakeholders. Could that be interpreted to also do one community meeting around this issue that restaurants and everybody else can come and be a part of?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Pearce. The way I read the motion as drafted. No, the request. The city attorney to work with staff to draft the ordinance relating to the ban. And I will say that the PowerPoint by Councilmember Gonzalez was very helpful to answer a lot of the questions that I had.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But then the second part of the motion was to request the city attorney or designee, I mean, the city manager designee to work with officers sustainability on developing the public education campaign relating to the ban. So those are two, as I read them, two separate items.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we will be working with staff through the city manager's office, whoever they designate us to work with on preparing. If this motion were to pass the draft ordinance, and as I understand the presentation, we will be looking at cities like Pasadena and including those elements from there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have been talking to Pasadena actually about their ordinance, including those best practices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in including working with community stakeholders to go through the process though, I mean, there's nothing keeping us from talking to some of the restaurants and making sure that they're meeting with staff or meeting with council to share their concerns or questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There would be nothing correct that staff could have a community meeting on that, but it wouldn't be the city attorney's office leading that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fine. No, not that I thought it would be the city attorney. Thank you for that clarification. And just again, to reiterate, I mean, in 2007, the memo I'm looking at says that we had the Grocers Association, American Plastics Council and Long Beach Restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to be very clear, there were also two steps put forward by city manager, city staff before that directed to steps. And one of them being this step that we have in front of us, the work's been done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's challenging for a city like Long Beach that our residents have vision and they have hope for what city we can be. And when we continue to let sometimes government bogged down by putting into too many steps to keep us from doing what's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's frustrating for for my constituents. And it's time for us to go ahead and put that step forward, guys. And so I'm I'm asking our council colleagues to vote with us today to make sure that we do the right thing, but to make sure that our staff and our sustainability commissioner and everybody else can move on to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'work on other things and not be talking about Styrofoam in another five years. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank my council colleagues, Pierson Gonzalez, for bringing this forward as well and for inviting me to join them in this. I'm also, as many of you know, and that has been pointed out, I have history with this was pillow talk before but it's a it's now come full circle to fruition'",
        "'speaker_6': 'into a council meeting. The the fact of the matter is, is that as council members piercingly pointed out, this is talking about process. This has been a process. It's been a long, long process, more than ten years with many council members involved, including one named Durango.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it took up our time that we come to the forefront with this issue, that we bring it to the fore to forward, that we bring it to a closure in the sense of having some kind of ordinance that deals with this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think Councilwoman Gonzales said it perfectly. We're not going from one to 1001 to 100. We're talking about implementation slowly so that eventually we develop what would be a workable ordinance that would be available to everybody as a member of the Coastal Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My my responsibility is to ensure access on our coast and also that it's a clean coast and it's part of that. I mean, there's no question that the cleanup at the Coast Commission has had on a yearly basis, polystyrene is the number two major polluter that's out there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're always picking it up because it's always there. And we are a beach city. And I think as a beach city, we need to take that responsibility to ensure that we address the polystyrene issue. So I'm fully supportive of this of this memo, of this motion to move forward with with an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I also very much support the fact that we need to get our stakeholders involved. They need to have we have to have their input. And one of the things that is that and Councilmember Pearce took the words right out of my mouth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a lot of volunteers out there, tons, millions of people who are volunteers who go to the beaches, volunteer their time to clean it up. So that people can enjoy the beauty that the beaches have to offer for us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's not only about the experts. It's not only about people who have an extensive knowledge of what polystyrene means to the environment. It's the volunteers who are out there every weekend cleaning it up because they know instinctively or maybe educationally what polystyrene does to not only our beaches, but to our waters and to our marine life'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And that's where it's important. Very true. We just passed a motion to help our aquarium to continue their programs in education and climate change. There are still some people out there and one in the in the Oval Office who doesn't believe in climate change while it's real.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I deal with it every month when I go to, of course, the commission meeting. We're always talking about sea level rise and we're talking about the impact of plastic in our oceans, and we're talking about the pollution that we deal with on a daily basis and that marine life that we're losing all the time because of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'pollution that we have. So I do want to implore my council colleagues to support this motion, to move this forward so that we can have a a environmentally safe beach in Long Beach. Where is Long Beach water? What makes it long, anyway?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's that's a a rhetorical question that does not end that answer. But that's what we want. We want a beach that people could come to and enjoy. And that's the only way we're going to be able to accomplish that, is by having limits on our pollution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to start by thanking everyone that's here today. I'm Gabriela Natasha, the Marine Research Group. The stuff that you do is really important and I appreciate your input. Also love your your t shirts. I think that it really stands for something that I truly believe in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I was elected to the city council, I came to an early council meeting and noticed that in the back where we would get water had cups that were not environmentally friendly. So I went out and purchased for all my council colleagues cups with their names on it for them to bring to council each week so that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'they would not be using throwaway cups. And so I'll return this to Councilmember Price and I know Ms.. Pearce doesn't know. Councilmember Pearce does not yet have one, but I'll work on that. Now in the back we have something different.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a compostable cup. However, this cup was manufactured in Colorado and polluted its way all the way to Long Beach and then to recycle this specific kind of cup, it is recycled in Kern County. And so it's a different kind of pollution that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I'm concerned that we're not really addressing the system as a whole. This cup, which many people hopefully don't use as often anymore because they have more environmentally friendly coffee cups. The challenge that some of the providers in my district have is how popular the order on demand has become.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So now you order your drink on demand and just pick it up. And so people are reducing their reliance and utilization of those cups. And so what does that look like? Furthermore, there's a business in my district that has revenue of $5 million a year, which is significant to sales tax revenue in my district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they use a cup similar to this. This cup is produced locally and is recycled in L.A. County, and they had a significant recycling program that they put into effect to ensure that cups like this are recycled. However.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The programs available are, in my opinion, the ones from START are too expensive. They rely on businesses fronting the cost for it, and I don't think that's fair either. I think that there are steps in between that are not being brought in on planes and trains and automobiles and ten wheel 18 wheelers or don't have the interior'",
        "'speaker_1': '. That's plastic. That makes this very difficult to recycle as well. I took part in the discussion that we had at the L.A. County level that actually moved over to the corn cups. And the challenge with the corn cups became and I think Natasha talked about the eventual options for composting is we don't have a long term compost'",
        "'speaker_1': 'available in the region and so those corn cups are ending back up in landfills in Long Beach were burning them and a corn cup actually burns better than some of these other alternatives, but we still have a challenge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additionally, I go to Washington, D.C. with the Federal Legislative Committee and meet with the Army Corps of Engineers about our beaches. And and one of the challenges is. The problem is the people who are littering, whether they're using this cup or this cup, they're still going to be littering.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that we need to do a lot of public outreach in that way as well, because whichever cup is on the beach is going to come back. And I would also say that if you were to come to me today and say, Stacy, I want your support for a foam cooler ban immediately, I would support'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that because that specific kind of of Styrofoam is almost never recycled. It breaks up into tiny pieces. It has those kinds of issues along with it. And so I'd like to see us get some reduction in recycling goals.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like us to potentially instruct waste management, our recycler of residential recycling, to clean poly polystyrene and sell it back to the other recyclable areas. There's another secondary recycle cycle center in South L.A. County that could recycle those if they were cleaned properly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they buy it because it has a market versus a cardboard, which we have piling up in our landfills as well, because the price of cardboard on the secondary market is so low. I appreciate that. We've done lots of research over the last ten years, and I know that we are a group of bright people who could'",
        "'speaker_1': 'come up with something bigger. I imagine that we could come up with instead of just a ban, we could say, any Long Beach business, who wants to buy whichever one of these cups is made locally? Let's say this one was made locally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All Long Beach businesses get a certain price on buying this kind of cup from a local manufacturer because we would be in a position then to say These are all paper, not plastic and filled recyclable cups. In what environment?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so just trying to find a bigger solution than just banning one item where they're going to replace that with another item that could, quite frankly, be less recyclable, that there are certain clamshells that don't have fiber in them, that are solid plastic that we actually are hearing are even worse off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd like to figure out what that looks like and and go big. That would be my comments. And I look forward to hearing from my colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Supernova.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And I'd also like to thank all the speakers tonight. I really appreciate you coming out on a different issue I referenced. It's tough to have folks out during the holiday season when you have a lot of stakeholders involved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it really appreciate you coming out five days before Christmas. Just by way of background, it was mentioned that I used to be on the Sustainable City Commission. I was actually a charter member in 2007 and served for seven years and two terms as chair.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So when we referenced the the city's actions seven years ago, I remember that because that was our first year of our commission. And in fact, the very first speaker mentioned Frank Colonna in those days. So our city manager and his staff, knowing that that item would come up tonight, actually forwarded as a memo today from Suzanne Frick'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in 2007, November 28, and referencing that. So the other part of my background, I have to tell you, is I chair the Environmental Committee of City Council. I learned about this item 11 days ago. Now to compare that to what happened in 2007, the environmental committee held outreach, invited over a thousand people to come and meet on'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this issue and the plastic ban issue simultaneously. And to say I haven't done my due diligence as chair of this committee is a gross understatement. And so I'm really kind of painted into a corner here. I don't want to be an obstructionist based on process, protocol and principle, but I think I'm really there because I just need'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to do the bare minimum due diligence. What I have is a plan in place where I'm open to holding as many meetings as as possible, starting right away if my council colleagues can do it with me. Councilmember Pierson and and Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And get this item vetted. You guys had some great positions tonight, some great ideas. I took a lot of notes, so bear with me as I try to quote many of you. And I think we can put this together very quickly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now, part of the proposal is 120 days to come back to to us with with just the council deliberation, the education plan and whatnot. I think we can work a fast track if we get the environmental community involved and and really get all the input with all the stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I can just go through the item a little bit here. For the agenda item 14 and. I think, first of all, I should put the caveat in that that it it changed to involve city staff and that's a great move.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But part two mentions the Sustainable City Commission. Part three. Mentions Economic Development Committee. And then I mentioned the 120 day item, and then upon approval, it will make it to the Environmental Committee. And I would suggest that sort of the the cart and the horse syndrome, I think it should come to the Environmental Committee first.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We get it fully vetted. All the stakeholders can be invited that time. There will be none of this talk of, boy, you really try to slip this bias five days before Christmas. I've heard that on multiple issues over the years, and it's tough to do an item like this that has the word ban in it at this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'time. So. I'd also like to just to quote some of the folks and and I really appreciate Tom Surfrider being here. Sonya Coffey from Surfrider and also you, my nominee to replacement in the Sustainable City Commission. You had mentioned that you directed staff in the city of Manhattan Beach, but you mentioned the word outreach to the community'",
        "'speaker_9': ', and that was evidently a key component that you had, and I think we need to do that. Elliot Gonzalez on the Sustainable City Commission, we served, I think, a little bit of time together that business friendliness. I think that what Surfrider does in their program is excellent and I think we could enhance that in the weeks to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'come because you're going to you'd have to wait 120 days anyway. So let's see what we can do from a council standpoint to enhance those programs, get the buzz out there that that it's open and robust. Speaking of robust, I think that we could possibly bring this back with stakeholder input and then present the city attorney with'",
        "'speaker_9': 'something that's ready for primetime if we go with it tonight. My fear is that it's in little too rough a form. Councilmember Mongeau just mentioned things that she like included. Many of the speakers mentioned many items they'd like included.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If we do a little due diligence upfront, we can get a cleaner piece to the city attorney that might be able to be turned around quickly and more efficiently. My other fear is that coming back to another night like this where it's not quite right, and then we have another delay as it goes back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that, I'll go ahead and propose a substitute motion for a little different approach, and I'll just kind of briefly go over some of the points here. So we would remove the language of the ban of tonight's item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We would request the city manager or some someone else to work to form a stakeholder group as a primary means to create the well-informed public participation process. The working group would include environmental groups, small business and restaurant owners, nonprofits and churches, the polystyrene or other product manufacturers and distributors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'd written down city staff before the council ever mentioned this, but definitely Environmental Services, the Office of Sustainability and one that no one's mentioned is the Health Department. We're talking about food safety here. We have our own health department that's kind of unique in the state of California, and I'd like to see them involved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And economic development, I think, is another key player. Part three would be request the city manager. And to to develop the stakeholder group for litter collection, maintenance, disposal of polystyrene, recyclability of polystyrene and other alternate food service containers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Economic cost impacts on restaurant community regarding food service service containers, alternate disposal efforts, composting waste to energy conversion and secondary material recovery facilities. And again, Councilmember Mongeau alluded to that and it should say here, hold up, prop now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So. I'll hold up a prop. This is actually a food container. It's half of a container that holds. I think it's a lemon cake or something that comes in in a tin. That's only half of it. This would not be banned under our ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So these are the types of things. Just food for thought. Pardon the expression that we might want to look at moving forward. So that is my. Motion, and I'd asked my colleagues to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Vice Mayor Richardson. So do you. Well, I was just going to. So I just want to make sure that we there is a substitute motion on the floor. And before we move on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second on the specific motion? There's a second on the substitute motion. And before we move forward, Mr. Richard, attorney thing, do you want to clarify that motion? I think you wanted it clarified.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. Members of the council member. Council member. Superman was one of your items to was to remove item one. The second was to form a stakeholder group. And then the third was asking for information or a study from the city manager's office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Was there a referral to the environmental committee or where was this to go to to do this study?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. The third item would involve the environmental committee. I mean, we would get them involved at any one process here. Do you want that delineated at this point? Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it would be helpful for the purposes of the motion to see if the item isn't moved forward tonight. Where it is. Where are you sending it to? So that these items could be brought back to that body?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Well, I had mentioned the city manager as the entity developing the stakeholder group. He could designate the Environmental Committee to do that or be involved in that process or anyone of his choosing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Next up, we have Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So just following along this conversation, let's see that last motion. Mr. Enviro Committee Chairman commits the environmental committee to a bunch more meetings. I don't know how the Environmental Committee feels about that, but but thank you for that substitute motion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just saw this presentation. It was it was put together well. And I think that the presentation from the aquarium adds a lot of context, particularly when, you know, ah, we're literally about to build. We just invested in building a new facility to talk about issues like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, you know, that's fresh in my mind and in my context. And then, you know, a few comments from the public. Some of them were striking. One, the statement about more plastic than fish in the ocean, that's just staggering to think about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, and that comes from someone who enjoys the ground fish. And I just think about the term. There's a lot of fish in the sea. Just, you know, it's it's kind of kind of a big term considering considering we are, you know, at the mouth of two rivers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do think, you know, we should be leading on this and having conversation and setting a standard, especially if we're going to expect communities upriver to follow suit so that we don't continue to pick up everybody else's trash.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think there were a number of good points brought up by the council. So in terms of like the engagement, the health department makes a lot of sense to me. The environmental standards looking at that makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Mongo had a lot of good recommendations in terms of looking at the awkward shaped things. And, you know, if we're going to, you know, repeal, you've got to repeal and replace, right? If you going to ban, you got to replace it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How can we guide that process? And, you know, I think there's a way we've learned a few things from the banning of plastic bags about enforcement. I remember when that went, you know, came the council. There was a lot of conversation about being punitive to small businesses and and how would we handle sort of how we handle'",
        "'speaker_8': ', you know, fines and things like that and enforcement. And I would say whatever we do here, we need to prioritize enforcement closer to the beaches, into the rivers, and ask staff to look at that. And I heard the concern about engaging businesses or stakeholder groups, and that's all supportive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what I want to do is try to throw a compromise motion that at that keeps the integrity of the first the first motion, frankly, just because on principle, I believe a lot of work went into this. And I want to make sure a lot of work went into this and a lot of stakeholders were involved in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'this, and that should be used as a starting point. So we'll start with the structure of that, and we'll try to integrate some of the concerns that that Councilman Supernormal and Councilmember Mungo expressed. And so particularly, I understand the concern about being an environmental committee chair and cart before the horse and those sorts of things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I have seen when, you know, sometimes when the city attorney is the one to write the the ordinance, we don't we we tend to go get the input ourselves and then be very prescriptive on what we ask them to write.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think this is an opportunity to do the opposite. We can delay just a little bit and ask the city attorney to get in, get engaged in writing the ordinance now, but be a part of the process, that outreach, that input process, so more specifically referred to the Environmental Committee to do a little bit more outreach'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with these stakeholders as a part of crafting the ordinance. So when it comes back, it respects the work that's been done, the ten years of history with former Councilmember Turanga, the work that the sponsors have done and sort of make sure this is a series of ten because I understand when folks ask about including stakeholders, but I'",
        "'speaker_8': 'also understand when that's a tactic to delay just when there's no intent to actually bring anything back. So I think there might be a way to sincerely, sincerely move forward, make sure those things are are included. And to be more specific, what might come back are very specific, you know, feedback about the timing because there wasn't in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'these recommendations was a lot of flexibility. I saw in the main motion about the timing for implementation, there was no conversation about finding all of those things, like the punitive elements are what we need, what we actually need the business community to weigh in on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what I'm hoping is maybe we can get ourselves out of the way and, you know, add, you know, an extra two month delay to this timeline for the city attorney and the committee to actually work and gather information and use that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have a draft to look at. So I'm going to structure that as my substitute motion. So the main integrity of this at a at a, you know, two months to this 180 day time, 120 day timeline.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let's make it 180 days. Let's ask staff to a city attorney to begin the process, but make sure, you know, it's inclusive of those things that we didn't prescribe tonight and allow that feedback to come in in terms of like those punitive elements and then to actually add staff as a part of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The second piece of this motion here asks staff to look at, you know, explore some programs or some opportunities for us to take in consideration some of Stacey's excuse me, Councilwoman Mungo's recommendations, because they may have made a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't have an awkwardly shaped Styrofoam item hold up, but it was compelling. It makes sense to me. So if the intent here is to try to find some common ground, something moves forward. I hope that that was a satisfactory compromise that still moves us forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's my substitute substitution. Oh, the mayor left. I'm in charge. Okay, so that's my substitute. Substitute motion. Is there a second on that? Oh. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Great. Okay. So next we have Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you very much. And first of all, I'd like to thank my my colleagues, Councilmember Gonzalez, Pierce and Urunga, for making this meeting fun and exciting and educational. This is an important issue, obviously, to many of us here in this beach city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to especially thank the public for coming out. Your public comments were not only educational, but, as I mentioned, to show that we have a lot of subject matter experts among our residents here and a lot of people doing a lot of great work at Goleta, the Marine research.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Katy, thank you for all you do. I had an opportunity to sit in on a presentation about a year and a half ago, two years ago with Captain Charles Moore. I found out that he was the grandson of William Reed, which was another December last year, would take you back to some of the conversations we had as'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a council. But he signed a book called Plastic Ocean, and reading that book was very, very informational for me. And last year, I actually sponsored and participated in a beach clean up with the Surfrider Foundation, which was very helpful to me because I witnessed the negative impacts of Styrofoam on our white sandy beaches.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's a no pun intended. It was that our beaches are a Styrofoam sand blend. And and it's very concerning for for several of the reasons I expressed here earlier. My question I mean and I do support a process, you guys, I'm consistent in that regard.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm always going to be for a process that and make sure that we we do it right. We're not rushing that. We're considering all factors and we're engaging all stakeholders. And so I believe the substitute substitute motion accomplishes that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do think but I do have a couple of questions and why this? This particular item does not ban retail use because at the end of the day, I mean, what we are proposing to do is we're asking businesses, small businesses, to alter their practices, but we're not asking our residents to alter their practices or retailers to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'alter anything. And so that is something I think we need to really, really consider if we're going to be intellectually honest about an approach to ban Styrofoam in the city of Long Beach. Again, I said I think the process should be fair and measured, it should be transparent.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think the start up accomplishes that. Styrofoam doesn't work well in microwave oven. A Band-Aid in my own household. And I want to just just to say that, you know, week after week, we hear issues come up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it's it's really important, I think, for us to be consistent. And I want to commend my my council colleagues for being environmental stewards. I want to commend the public for their commitment to the environment. Obviously there's some great efforts to to to to to to fight for the beaches and the environment and fight for the residents'",
        "'speaker_10': 'here. But there's other types of pollution as well. And we discussed those ad nauseum last week with over three and a half hours of study session, noise pollution, air pollution. You know, and I would just say, on behalf of my residents, I'm sure that they would appreciate some consistency on that issue as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. Thank you. And so when we when we talk about other types of pollution and impacts on neighborhoods and communities and other areas of the city, unless, let's remember, the passion in which we fought for this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Pryce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, want to thank my colleagues, and especially Councilwoman Gonzales, for bringing this item forward. I think the presentation that she did was excellent. And I have to say, I'm a big fan of people articulating their position via PowerPoint or in whatever way it helps them identify what is important to them and why'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I'm glad to see that that is something that we are doing more often because I feel like I learn every time there is such a presentation. So I'm very grateful for that. And I know Councilman Superman did it last week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again, same thing. Perhaps that's the way I learn. I found it very, very helpful. So I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. This is actually a really great item. We, my chief of staff, Julie Maliki, had worked with Council District Twos Chief of staff about a year ago in exploring this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we did a little bit of study on the history of the item and a kind of understanding what had happened. And I agree with my colleagues that there has been a great deal of work on this particular item in the past.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do think it's important, though, that we have stakeholders involved at every stage, and what happens is that people change, right? Business owners change, community organization leaders change. And it's important for people to feel heard at the time that the item is happening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to to talk about a process that happened that they weren't involved in doesn't really make people feel like they were heard. We have had Goleta come out to our community meeting to do a presentation and we've been very happy to support a lot of their efforts sponsoring some of the programs that they do in our local'",
        "'speaker_4': 'schools since we were my district represents a lot of the coastal community and so we've actually partnered with them. We do trash pickups. We do a monthly trash pickup event. I'd love to see some of the folks here at them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We we have done two now where we've picked up trash with about 30 community members. And yes, there's a lot of Styrofoam. It's all over the place. It's very frustrating to see. And it just makes me sad, honestly, to see it all over the community and especially in the lagoon and in our waterways.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I support the item. I wanted to hear from all of the people who came out to advocate for the item and from my colleagues so that I could really consider what everybody had to say and kind of trying to decide where I stand on this particular item tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's important, like I said, to include current stakeholders, current business owners. I want them to feel heard. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Councilman Super Na. I don't take his expertize on the commission and the work that he did there lightly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's definitely something that is worthy of the respect, respect for everybody, the ones bringing the item today and also those who have worked diligently on this item in the past. My only concern, and I have to be honest, I'm a little bit confused about our substitute and our substitute substitute because it sounds like they're similar'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or very similar. My only concern would be I think it's great to have a date certain because I understand that it happens when things get sent out for a study or something and they never come back. It's happened to several of my items, but I think it's important.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm okay with the date certain. My my question is if really the ordinance is going to reflect the involvement of the stakeholders, would we not want the city attorney's office to. Listen to the information that we get back, because what's the point of us having a process if parallel contemporaneous to the process?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're drafting an ordinance not mindful of what's happening in the various committees or commissions or stakeholder meetings and that kind of thing. So I'm okay with the date certain, but I wonder if there's a way. I wonder if Vice Mayor Richardson, if you're open to a friendly to your substitute substitute that has a date certain but doesn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'but allows them to start their ordinance drafting maybe after some meetings have been had so that people actually are heard because if they're drafting an ordinance and we're doing a stakeholder process, then the ordinance isn't going to reflect what the stakeholders are saying.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I loved about the presentation that Councilwoman Gonzalez gave is that she is open to and is suggestive of some business incentives and business ideas. So perhaps I know we've done a lot of outreach, but we haven't done outreach with today's stakeholders in the business community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that for a fact because a lot of my businesses didn't know this item was on, so I would like to at least put that out there and not get the criticism of us. We didn't know about it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. Yeah. And I think and thank you for allowing me the opportunity to clarify. I think that was the intent that when I say begin the process not of drafting it. Right? We just don't want to have to take a step of going back out, do outreach, coming back to the council, going through more procedure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. So the when I say involved in the process, I mean in that stakeholder part with the committee, like we want that to help inform those items that weren't prescribed tonight. Tonight was very high level. It said we want some some phase in it said we want some incentives and said we want, you know, to look at'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the, you know, any punitive elements that should be informed by the businesses who are impacted. So rather than like we know what, we need input on the council saying we're okay with getting input from them. So what I'm saying is city attorney like we're, you know, via councilman super knoll's recommendation of the committee just go, you know'",
        "'speaker_8': ', let's sort of narrow that down, get that input there, give it straight to city attorney. When it comes back to council, we're ready to make make a no one can say that haven't been engaged council expressed interest in in doing something substantive and we want to just demonstrate that we're serious.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not just a and we've seen it before, you know, delay to delay to the delay. Right. So so I think you're right. And so if that you need that to be a friendly, accept it. That's fine, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I mean, just just something to the effect of the city attorney to wait prior prior to drafting the ordinance, wait for feedback from the various stakeholder communities or groups.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the way I think it would be, we added an extra, I think 60 days, right? So we would hope that that element, that element, you know, stays. So the know outreach to the stakeholders through the committee happens in two months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, so that we know it's not a perpetual thing and that still allows the four months they originally requested for for crafting the item. I mean, the ordinance and sometimes and frankly, some of it may not be in the ordinance like incentives and all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those a lot of times are separate programs as funding is available and it's not linked to an ordinance. So all of that together could come back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Let me let me go ahead. Before Mr. City attorney, I mean, a little clarification as well here. So just before we get to I never want to have a chance to speak. I want to just say a few things and then go back to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The substitute substitute this on the motion on the floor. One, I just wanted to say for all the for all the folks that are out here, like thank you for your advocacy. And so, you know, when this ordinance comes back, whether it's in 90 days or 120 days, when it comes back to to this body and certainly'",
        "'speaker_0': 'when it's passed, I look forward to signing it and I look forward to getting making this law. I think that's really important. So I'm going to be very supportive of where this is going and where this well, this will end up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that Long Beach led the way on the plastic bag issue. It was a tough vote. We led the way, more cities followed and the state went and did their work in this case. But a lot of cities have done this work already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Long Beach can help lead the way. And eventually I think what will happen is the state again will follow and we'll end up with this with a statewide policy, which is oftentimes, as you all know, cities have to lead for the state to follow in these important environmental issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This has everything to do with with what's happening currently, as you all know, in our oceans and on our planet. And it's absolutely direct ties to our climate change initiative. And so I support that. What I did want to say is what I think the substrate substitute has.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the way I heard the motion is and I want to thank you for the clarification from Councilman Price and others, is a sense that you were going to take probably 60, 90 days or a couple of months to do public outreach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Environmental Committee of the City Council will be involved. There'll be conversations at the Economic Development Commission. There will be conversations and hopefully reaching out to the business community, reengage our environmental folks and our leaders within the first few months of that process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then after that process is complete, then at that point the city attorney begins drafting. The draft ordinance does need to go back to the council for approval to start the ordinance. But it begins it begins. The drafting process begins after all that input has been collected over the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then at that point, the draft ordinance comes back to the city council. It sounds like to me now 180 days, is that what you had said? I mean, I think that's that's I think, what, six months? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think, you know, that could be scaled back. But I mean, if that's that's the will of the council 180 days. Is fine. And so then you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Can come back sooner if they're done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if it's done sooner, yeah. Obviously, the most important part is the public outreach portion at the start. Right. So you don't want to rush the meetings with business. You don't want to rush the meetings with the the commissions and the committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if there is if it comes back sooner, at that point, the city attorney, that really becomes up to you. And I think in fairness, I do I do think it's important to engage the small business owners that are out there that have legitimate concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They obviously, a lot of them I've heard from care about the environment and they just want to know and want to, you know, both on the education side, but they want to be partners in this, too. And so let's let's let's make it a win and ensure that our small, small businesses that are operating good restaurants are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'also partners in this process. And that we can all go and hopefully do this together, I think would be ideal. And so I think that was the substitute substitute. Mr. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sounds sounds really good. And I think the small business piece is spot on. Let's not make the mistake of thinking all our small businesses are using plastic bags. Let's just be honest about implementation. Right. This is the we're going to need a lot more education in multilingual format for this to really be a success.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. And so I agree. To me, the sub sub sounds, I think, fair, and it includes the business community. And I want to thank Councilman Gonzales. I think you've done a great job in leading this issue as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that. Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, you clarified some of my question. So I definitely am supportive of the substitute substitute as Vice Chair of the Environmental Committee, as I would like to say that I definitely want to push to have that meeting happen soon so that we can spend the next two months engaging with stakeholders and hopefully the next two months after'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that, drafting an ordinance so that we can come back soon. So with my committee members sometime in January, maybe. So that's all I'm going to say. I think everybody's done a great job. I think it's a late night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just want to continue to say thank you guys for sticking in there with us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember supermodel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I think everyone in the room knows what my intent was. If anyone thought it was a delay tactic, you are absolutely wrong. I was trying to speed up the process. I guess I suffer from being around too long.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I've seen this go the wrong direction too many times for something is sent over here and we never see it again. I guess the 2000 motion would qualify under that heading and I was sincerely trying to avoid that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also, just just one one of the comments that the vice mayor said was, get ourselves out of the way. It's not that he's wrong and I'm right, that it's just so contrary to my style that we're probably never going to agree on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm very hands on and and that's just the way I work. Finally, I'd also just like to add one other city department and that is serve not your kind of serve, but the SC RF. I just realized in my credentials I forgot to mention I believe I'm chair of that committee right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so when we meet next year, remember that Vice Mayor and I will do everything I can to hold the meetings efficiently and and soon. And we can have a quorum with two members, myself and and Janine peers, if the vice mayor is not available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the whole purpose is to get that stakeholder input. That was my goal for that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Appreciate that, Mr. City. Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor. Thank you for the clarification. Just a couple other points. I think the vice mayor's motion substitutes substitute included the recommendations as amended by the council member from the first District. Yes. Which would. Okay, thank you. Which should include elimination of the sale.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just the and this is for the beginning point, I think at the Environmental Committee meeting, we would probably provide them with some sort of a a draft similar to what Pasadena has adopted as a starting point for discussion, because that was in as part of her motion and part of her handout.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we wouldn't be drafting a motion, we would be waiting for feedback. But as far as a starting point, we may provide them a copy of the Pasadena ordinance for a starting point to discuss. And then we would also send this to the Economic Development Commission for discussion of local business incentives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as the Vice Mayor said, that may or may not be included as part of the ordinance because that would have a financial component that may not be part of that. And then I had 180 days. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, we have Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I am. I'm not in favor of making it longer. I mean, I'll go with it. I also think we should bring it back 120 days. I was looking for something closer to May 4th. I would like to see us also write into the ban.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically things like this and the Styrofoam ice chests. I think those are really terrible and I think that there are many alternatives already. But I would also like to see some exemptions if you have a business that has a recycling program on site so that they don't go over to a worse cup, they should be exempt from'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the ban. Or and or we should talk about what are the other things that many of these industry groups move over to that are actually worse? And we should make sure that that's included. And I think that's part of the dialog of bringing it back, because if we just say we're going to do a ban and we're'",
        "'speaker_1': 'going to reach out to the community and hear how they feel about it. And they're going to just change over to products that are worse. We need to talk about that because I don't think that that gets to any of our outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll definitely be throwing a stakeholder in there who will come and discuss the recycle program or what that looks like, and potential options for other businesses that want to implement something such as that because the other products that they have to choose from aren't as friendly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thanks so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Andrews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you. I'm just hoping you could just bear with me for the next 20 minutes. We should be able to get through this guy. First of all, I just want to commend Lena for such a fantastic job.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think everyone of us really understand now a little more about what we're trying to do, because it's very important, especially when you talk about our oceans and the cleanliness, that we should be really looking forward to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So at this point, I would just like to call for the question of we can stop all of this right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's a there's a motion in a second called call for the question, which was any objection? I'm going to go ahead and go take a vote. Okay. No objection. Great. So with that members with no objection, please go ahead and cast your votes for the motion in a second.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm cued up if that's prevent the system from working.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, we need to do the voice vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A voice vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the call for the question. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate staff keeping that in mind. Each of our offices often work independently with the communities that we serve until we get to a point where we know where we want to go and then we find out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our colleagues are also thinking in the same direction, and I'm really excited to have colleagues that are being mindful of this process. A couple of key things that that have come to date recently, and I hope that we'll work on including it in this item as well.'",

        "'speaker_1': ', not in my district, but over in the seventh District. And so we've talked a lot about what other options there are.

        "'speaker_1': 'There are 700 different contractors and a thousand different inspector. I'm sorry, a thousand different architects. That'll draw those up for you and charge you an exuberant amount. And something that constituents have come to me about. And I've also discussed with Vice Mayor Richardson, because it was his constituent who owns businesses in my district as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We should be able to have pre formatted plans like that online. You should be able to just download it and get it to go. I gave you the credit. But but he he came to me too and called me today about it specifically.'",

I'm not trying to look to reduce the revenues of our architects and our contractors, but we should know and understand'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Council Members Mayor Staff Jimmy Harris, senior vice president of Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce, will make this short and sweet. We appreciate this item bringing it forward tonight. Appreciate a seat at the table when discussing this, 800 plus members.'",

So we've been through. This process with the cops. A lot of times I just I just wanted to come come forward and back the recommendation that this be revisited.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It can be very grueling on a small business. Time consuming, costly. And in the end, you can often come up with nothing if if not more restriction placed on you. So I. I appreciate the council members bringing this issue forward and I support it.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You know the numbers that are thrown at you, you know, you're talking about $10,000. And it's you know, you're a little weary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've had pleasant experience with a great team and.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Surely beside with respect to multi-jurisdictional and agreement regarding Senate Bill two of the California housing element. I am finding not only in this city but other local coastal community cities are running into problems inadvertently and I don't believe intentionally when the community and the business community, the residential community does not understand that by right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homeless services have zoning by right. And it does not require a conditional use permit when within a particular Jewish jurisdiction and locality, if the zoning does not meet the requirement of its its homeless. When is zoning? Jurisdictional does not meet the requirement of its population.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you have 4000 homeless people in a particular jurisdiction, but you only zone in an area where there's only 400, then you're going to run into a problem with your residential community and the business community because they're not going to be aware that by right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By right when you are not meeting your need. Homeless services are allowed to function within a commercial and a residential community by right. By, right? I believe it is an unfair. To the community of homeless people and the community of the business and community of commercial residential.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When the three do not understand. That by right. Homeless services are allowed when you are not meeting your your zoning allowance needs. If you have 4000 homeless people in a particular city, you must zone by write. And there should not be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You should not be receiving repercussions after we move into a particular city. And then suddenly the community finds out homeless people are being assisted here and certainly we have a problem with it. I would say and I question I'm saying and I am also questioning whether or not as council persons representing each district, whether or not you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have properly alerted and informed your citizenry that by right according to Senate Bill two, which augmented homeless services if the need has not been met. I'm finding this is the condition. This is the situation along the coast from Santa Barbara to Orange County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're all having the same problem. They're saying we weren't told. So my hope is that you tell them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you to Councilwoman Pierce all the cosigners on this item. And it seems like copies of the thing that the council every few years or maybe every few months we come back and tweak. And what's excited about this motion is a real opportunity to get creative.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so thank you for taking the lead on this. Councilwoman Pierce. So given, you know, allow we've tweaked this over the years. We like some things. We want to make sure some of those things are protected. So could the process be changed and streamlined, maybe cheaper?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Should we be impacting our protections on neighborhoods? No. We should still maintain our ability to protect our neighborhoods from some you know, some of the bad actors or the nuisance activities in neighborhood. Should we roll back any of the protections we put in our loopholes?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, we should not. I want to just have a just ask a few questions to staff quickly on how to approach a few things. So is some of that stuff that's important to me? Like, you know, we went through a whole conversation, actually got awards about alcohol, nuisance abatement ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Liquor stores were a big conversation. We want to make sure that we we you know, we had a conversation about defining what is a liquor store, because it's the same it's the same definition, same liquor license as a pharmacy or grocery store.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we had to, you know, go through that process and define that. How are we going to approach that and protect, you know, the progress we made there?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the NRA ordinance would not be impacted by this because those that covers locations that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do not currently have a copy and is an important component in our enforcement of those locations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the NRA would remain as is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the and I get that the question is like, you know, maybe two years ago there was a conversation about, you know, what is a liquor store and what in the grocery store is a Walmart, a liquor store?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A grocery store is a pharmacy, a liquor store, a grocery store, same license. We respond to them very differently. The community response to them very differently, yes. So we had that conversation. I want to make sure that, you know, where we landed is preserved here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then, you know, there was a conversation and a lot of good work was done in the health department and it crossed over into planning around healthy standards in liquor stores. And, you know, we started to see some standard conditions be crafted and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, we got to a good place. And then we stopped getting liquor store applications for a while, which is a good thing, too. So are we going to, you know, make sure that we look at that lens, the healthy food standards that have been crafted over the years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Specifically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Related to alcohol? Sirups Yes, we can.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Certainly. Thank you very much. And then the last thing that I think is really cool that could happen here, city of New Orleans, Decatur, Georgia, they created some like, you know, CFP and permit zones that in certain areas that they encouraged more entertainment or more activity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They got rid of the permit fees altogether. If you meet certain criteria, like if you're festival meet certain criteria or if your business is an area that really needs that activity. They had a special rate or special process that made it really easy for those areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So like an incentive zone. In fact, the program, if you want to look up look it up indicator is called. There's a festival for that. And if you're on a certain corridor and you want to host a festival, if you meet certain rules, we get rid of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just want to just put on the table as we look at KPIs, let's, let's think about how we can also look at leveraging that and permits in certain areas to create some cool opportunities. And that's just a recommendation to, you know, just a recommendation of staff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just think you'd like to also commend Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. I think in many discussion, discussions with small and medium businesses were often talking about the CFP process and how we can fine tune it. And so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a couple questions for Amy. First, do we have as a city ombudsman specifically for small business? I know we have Saeed Jalali, who works as kind of a city wide ombudsman, but anyone specifically working with small business.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Mayor and council members, I answer that. We have said Jalali, who has been our ombudsman and the council in the FY17 budget, actually added a second position. So we will have a second ombudsman. We're doing the hiring for that right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. And then how does the do we link the CP process currently with Business Port? I know as we're rolling that out, is that something that could be added in? Certainly. Yes. What we'd like to really do, though, first is to try to strip down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As one of the council members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Already has said, strip down the entire process and really see what is important to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And once we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have that new process in place, it should be much, easily, much more easily disseminated through busy port. Some great. Thank you very much. I look forward to hearing back the report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. I like to consider myself as a small, business friendly council member. I want to commend our Development Services Department for their excellent support, particularly in the business districts in my district, in support of small business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think obviously there are areas that we need to improve, and this is why I signed on to this this item. I think we should always be striving for continuous improvement with our processes, particularly processes that that encourage or that engage commerce and economic development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think, you know, we're one of the most important roles that I think I have as a city councilmember is is actually supporting small business and new businesses coming in with with with in conjunction with our business improvement districts.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we've we're doing ribbon cuttings, you know, once a week, it seems like, in my district. And so something is working. And so I want to commend you this biotech and your department and Pat West for for your support in my district.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I did have one question in terms of process here, because what are what are we trying to accomplish? I did sign on, but I do see that this is a a process that that asks the city manager and city attorney to engage with the Economic Development Commission in Planning Commission to review and make recommendations on a number'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of areas. Is this in an effort to to actually go toward a change in ordinance later? And will this come back to forefront?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly because it affects Title 21, it does involve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going to the planning commission and because it affects the municipal code title 21, it actually does have to come back to the city council as an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. I'll be supporting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council members, open up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I'd like to echo the words of one of our speakers, Luis Navarro, owner of Lola's. I, too, have had some very good experiences with development services, so thank you, Amy, for your work in that department. We've talked about one item that I prefer, and that is as the cops are sent out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If the council office could get a heads up like 24 hours prior or something, as long as we're going to tweak this thing, I'd like to throw that in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So you're talking about the noticing?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I'm sorry. Yeah, the topic is noticing. I have no desire to pull that back. As was mentioned by my colleagues here, we what we owe to the neighborhoods. But we just like to get a notice just before it goes out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Would be very handy. So we're just not blindsided.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you. I just wanted to clarify also, in addition to sending this to the committees, I believe that some of us council members would also like to put together a community meeting sometime in the next month or two months to get the bid's involvement and to really have a public process on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one last thing is just, you know, the at cost. I got a couple of questions about the cost of notifications. And so this will make sure that we continue to notify residents that the neighborhoods aren't being impacted, but that we're doing it in a more efficient way and really trying to have government work smarter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, again, thank you, everybody, for your support tonight. Hopefully.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you, Mayor. I just want to thank Mrs. Bodak for really being there for my district because the fact that there's businesses going in and to really help in our community to look like a chair look and thank you again.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Wonderful. Because right now, when you go on to the larger model to look at the animal data right now on an L.A. County site, the entire Long Beach area is just blink because they don't have our data as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so hopefully they'll be able to click on it. It would bring them back to our site, which would then create a loop of people engaging with our open data portal. So I look forward to seeing that. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. And now we're going to move on to public comment. Public comment, I think we have Rob here. And as it's coming down, the this will this will initiate the launch of our actual site that all this amazing data is going to be on the for the public to use and see in real time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's going to be really exciting. So. Mr. Chairman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Mr. Mayor, in a city council. Thanks very much for taking this issue up tonight. I think that Brian did a really excellent job of outlining what the portal is going to do. But and as you alluded to, Mr. Mayor, this is a very big deal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a big deal for the city of Long Beach. I think there's not an issue on the agenda tonight that open data would not contribute to the discussion, too. It helps inform administrators as they work among the various departments, helps inform residents about what's going on in their city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then ultimately you as policymakers can make use of it as well. I've worked on this issue in a lot of different jurisdictions. I sponsored legislation at the state level on the issue. It was discussed the stakeholder process that we went to, and we had a lot of really great engagement in shaping this policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'd be the 10th city in California to adopt such a policy, and I think just the 50th nationwide. But I want to talk just briefly about the three kind of macro opportunities that I think this policy presents. The first is to spur innovation in our community by freeing up this information, allowing folks to combine it with other'",
        "'speaker_3': 'jurisdictions. As Councilwoman Mongo mentioned, you can create new apps, you can learn new things, and the community can really aid the city in trying to solve some of its more pressing problems. That data is also of inherent value, so that spurs economic development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The McKinsey Global Institute pegged the worldwide value of open data at over $3 trillion. And so, again, Long Beach could be at the forefront of this. There's a lot of great firms in our city that want to make use of this data, and they'll have their hands on it soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second is to spur innovation within government, to allow departments to collaborate with one another, to allow cities and counties to share information among themselves. In the city of New York did a study after the implementation of their policy, they found they're saving $10 million a year annually just on Freedom of Information requests through their portal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the final and possibly the most important is I think this affirms the city's commitment to open, honest and effective government. It's a critical peg of transparency, and it's going to invite the community into the goings on to the city and invite them in to help shape policies in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So last point I want to make is to specifically call out Brian and the staff of our commission and of the Society Department for the terrific work they did. I think they've craft the best policy I've ever seen, and I encourage you all to endorse it here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thanks again. And you guys you guys did a great job. And don't forget this community. We have these amazing commissioners who are volunteers who are working on this stuff for us every single day, and we're very grateful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilmember Pierce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I just wanted to, you know, thank Rob for his work on the commission, but also really thank you, Mayor. I know whenever you were elected, transparency and open government was something that was a key part of coming on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wanted to clarify this would also include our PD to our police department as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. This includes data that is available through the city. Whether it's any specific department, all data would be available as as it goes forward.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'You know, one thing that you include in terms of the following, the browning. Rules. I think that says it enough for me right there that I'm pretty sure that you're on the up and up. But I can't support the motion as presented.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'm going to support the substitute motion. So just my thoughts here. Over the past few years, bids have really stepped up in the wake of the loss of redevelopment, particularly in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we saw the last redevelopment come in, my predecessor, Steve Neal, had the foresight to say, look, we're going to need some deal making ability here in uptown and, you know, charged us with let's go create a business district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was not easy. We had responses from, you know, you know, city staff, a number of folks saying this might take you a decade, but no one had ever pulled the businesses in the room and asked them, were you willing to step up if the city steps up and partners with you to create it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And to our surprise, they did. They enough property owners signed a petition and voted on it. But since then, it hasn't been easy. Like people like going from, you know, very little capacity to the presentation we saw two years to two weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And City Council has taken a lot. It's taken resources. It's taken manpower. It's taken a lot of collaboration. So so while I you know, I do support transparency. Transparency should go in collaboration and go hand in hand with collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I was surprised today that I was surprised. I was out of town when I heard about this, but I was surprised to see that COBA, the Uptown Business District and a number of the business districts had no idea that this was coming.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's just so strange to me because I see that I see them as an extension of the city's family. And I think this sends a bad message if we do that. I saw a couple of things. So, number one, I feel that the motion, you know, substitute motion is good.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we want to learn more about what the business districts are doing across the city, they already report the was annually and they get very little questions and they prepare for those. And he takes time and those things are on record with the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let's just ask them. Let's work with, you know, Jim Fisk and our economic development folks, see what they're already doing and said before we commit them to extra work and place that information in an open space. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Put it on the open data platform. That should be something that, you know, doesn't take a lot of staff time. And we're already, you know, placing emphasis on open data. We might say it's very little impact. But if, you know, a business is being audited by a government, whether it be the city of Long Beach or the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'IRS, you need to, you know, hire people and build capacity to be responsive in a way that your property owners feel confident in. So we may say it's it's no capacity need it, but any smart person would say, you know, strap up, lawyer up or get get, you know, ask your accountant to spend more hours than what'",
        "'speaker_8': 'you budget to prepare to respond to it. So that's so I'm concerned about the, you know, financial nature of it. Next, I think, you know, there are a lot of questions that could be answered in terms of renewal schedules.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How are they coordinated renewals, vigils? Because sometimes we participate, sometimes we don't, and we need to be aware of that. So that's something we can look at in the open data space. You know, what is the history of of audits like?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we wanted to look at the history a lot is what do we even get them? That's a question. Another thing, you know, I have a good relationship with my business district. I, you know, I, I know would find it troublesome if I, as a council member would be upset with a decision my business district has made'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and, you know, slap them with an audit because I have that power and I'm concerned about whether that's the intent here or not. It doesn't matter. I'm just concerned about the perception or appearance of an abuse of power, because we have access to a city auditor that elected officials make the decision when to deploy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's just troublesome for me. And I would not say anything about anybody here at the dais, but that's when this recommendation comes up. It is up. You know, that's that's a question for us all for those reasons that, one, the business districts were were clueless on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Number two, we never asked city staff report and I don't remember any questions, not just about any questions from the council during the annual reports. Then I think we haven't demonstrated any progressive level of inquiry before going to an audit and I think that is no way to really cultivate collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's why I'm going to support the service, the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's a lot of information. I didn't know about the item, but I don't have a permit or a bit in my district, so I didn't think too much about it. But I do know that we went through quite a extensive presentation today from our economic development director, and one of the things that I'm really proud of is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'since taking office, the fifth District has started 562 new businesses, and that's 562. It's our area code. It's it's really something we're proud of. And most small businesses don't make it in the first two years. And so when I was reviewing the Business Health app that our economic development department is launching and talking to them about the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'resources available and how we now want to go out to our bids and ask them to go in and check on the businesses that are in red because their business license hasn't been renewed. Perhaps they're having financial challenges.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're talking through what that looks like. I was hoping we'd be going to our bids with those kinds of requests in the near future. I am aware that they do an annual review and present all that information to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm looking forward to being able to help them more efficiently respond to praise in the same way that we do and that we need to put all our data online. Every single council item needs backup documentation attached to the item, even if it's a week after all of the things that are handed out need to be attached'",
        "'speaker_1': '. We need to scan all the documents that are in this building and get those archived immediately. And I haven't seen a statement of work on that. I don't know that we know where we're going on that. So I want to see open data be our solution, and I need to see a more aggressive timeline on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll also say that. I really value having an independent auditor in auditor. DOWD And Laura does an exceptional job of bringing together her own internal auditors to discuss what the 2017 plan is going to look like. And so when they do that, they do it from a position of knowing and understanding all the audits that they've seen'",
        "'speaker_1': ', the issues that they've had. I've met with her on this several times, and so I'm not super comfortable saying we as the city council are now going to instruct you to change your plan and change some things about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, if the substitute motion is successful and you and your team want to amend your own plan and your own timeline because you feel that this is a concern area. I've reviewed the list both with you in the past of what you're doing in 2017, and I think there are things on it that I'm really looking forward'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to seeing and seen very soon. And when I compare it to the need a necessity for this kind of review. Again, I didn't hear from my community on this because all of our business associations are volunteer, so they wouldn't be impacted, but I think they would value the best practices that would come from the review.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I'm inclined at this time to continue to listen to my colleagues, but to support an open data model that is in the direction of self reporting online, what you've already done so that it's easily accessible and a place where your your CO businesses would go without using a PRA to see what you've already done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's easy to give that back to the board, but to give it to all your business members, to give it to all the community people who aren't members, I think that there's some value in that. So that's the direction I'm leaning at this time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to go to Councilman Austin, Councilman Gonzalez, and then a vote. Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks. And I think there's been some some miscommunication and some mis interpretation of the intent. The original motion asked the city auditor to do three things review internal controls of how funds are handled and spent by Pids and BS to how they are operating in compliance with the City Agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And three possible benchmarking as to how other cities oversee P bids and report back to the City Council findings. Now, there's nothing in that limited scope that would, in my opinion, at any cost, any any operating procedures of a bid.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if that that that would be something. And if so, that would be something that we could take on, I think is very, very important in terms of public confidence, since, you know, our public dollars are being passed through these entities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They are always I public, public. They don't have the same level of accountability as our city departments, but they function very much as a as the arm of the city, as as was mentioned by the the extension of the city, as was mentioned by one of the council members.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I do have a question regarding the city auditor scope, and maybe this is for the city attorney or the city auditor. Does the city council direction or lack of direction impact the scope of what the city auditor actually can look at?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because if, for example, this substitute substitute motion or substitute motion that's actually on the floor would take us in a whole different direction and take the city auditor out of the scope based on direction here. But does canvas does the city auditor have the scope to and I believe she does audit independently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The right is separately elected auditor that does have the independent. There's specific requirements under the charter that the auditor is required to do. But in addition to that, as a separately elected official can to undertake additional audits.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. And I don't believe that any of our bids have anything to hide. I think they are operating in good faith. I work very closely with the business improvement districts in my, my, my, my district, and I'm very impressed with the output and work that they do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But this is a IT issue of, like I said, good government, right? We do not want to have issues. And, you know, I've heard of issues in other other areas of the city. We have new bids coming online.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'd like to bring on another bid in my district. Right. But, you know, best practices want to be we want to make sure that best practices are established. I don't have an issue with open transparency and open data, but I've heard also that that audits have already been done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If that's the case, I'd like to make a substitute substitute motion. Right. To to. Expand the scope of the original motion. Basically review the internal controls of how funds are handled and split number two, how they are in compliance with city agreements.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And three, possible benchmarking as to how other cities bids are functioning and best practices and report back to the City Council with that if if bids have already done internal audits. Well, let's take a step out of the process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let's ask them 2 to 2. Volunteer those those that information to the city auditor. And I think that would streamline and get to the to the cut to the chase. And again, I'll make sure that we are doing all we can to ensure that the public confidence and public trust is is is that here to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I'll make the motion for the substitute. Substitute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a substitute substitute. Is there a second on the subject? Catherine Austin, can you. Chime in on the subject to substitute their. Okay. Is there a motion for the substance substitute, which is Councilwoman Price?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, but I would like a little bit of clarification. I want to second because I want to talk about it, but I definitely want some a little bit of clarification on it too, because it sounds reasonable. I want to hear from my colleagues about it, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Can you just clarify a little bit of your motion again, Councilmember Austin, so I can.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Suggest the original motion with in addition to allow it allows the the bids who have undertaken independent audits or their own audits to present that information to the city auditor's office for review.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. It seems like it's the same motion. But what? I'll just say. Well, thank you for clarifying. I appreciate it. And so I'll say that I am also I'm you know, in looking at this item, I maybe I have to go back to basics and think that sometimes we just have to pick up the phone and contact'",
        "'speaker_4': 'our business improvement districts. And I think in terms of fairness as well, when I look at the Business Improvement District page on our website, you know, it also includes tourism and airport and downtown. And so I think that we're we it looks to me that we're being a little piggy and choosy as to who we want to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'include in this. And so I, I just don't think that this is an item that I would be able to support, because I don't feel like the lines of communication are open. I feel as though Jim Fiske is there for a reason.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He's there to ask any questions. I know I've contacted him quite frequently about any questions I've had. I have Magnolia Industrial Group in my my district, the downtown Long Beach Associates, and I've attended the meetings. And if there's questions that are raised, we go through that and we talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I, I think that heading in this direction, I don't know is the best option at this point. But I do believe that there needs to be some framework put in place to be able to have checks and balances in some degree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that framework needs to be put in place. And I think before getting there, we should put that framework in place. So that's my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next step is Councilmember. Councilmember Supernormal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd just like to ask the city attorney to clarify the relationship between a council office and the bid. We had this discussion. I think I was on the job for a month or so when this came up and you explained it in detail that there's a bit of a firewall, for lack of a better term, between the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'council office. So I'm a little curious how we could a council office could trigger an audit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mayor. Members of the council. Yes. An individual council member could not trigger an audit. I mean, that's why the item is before the council today to acting as a body to request the city auditor. The conversation that we had as once the city adopts or creates the permit, it becomes an instrument or an agency of the city'",
        "'speaker_6': 'under state law. So it becomes the responsibility of the city to approve the annual plan and to approve the documents and their operations going forward. But an individual council member under the charter can't direct or to do that under section two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I think I just wanted to reiterate the only thing I can support the substitute. Substitute? Because I feel like we we already have beds that are providing information and just making sure that we go forward with that step first and going through the transparency process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If, in fact, there is a need then for the city auditor to do an audit. She doesn't need our direction to do that. So I'm just reiterating that I would ask that you support my substitute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'K Vice Mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I, I don't think that the substitute substitute is responsible, responsive to the council's comments or the public comment. It's very similar to the original motion. If anything, it expands on the original motion. And so for that reason, I can't support it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we you know nothing against our city auditor, we love our city auditor. But I think we just need to be careful when we deploy or make requests of our city. And and then I would say, I think the request about like more information is good.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that the appropriate person to do it. We should ask the city manager to ask Jim Fiske to put together a report on what a lot of these things are and start, you know, these best practices, see what those things are they can collaborate with in order.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They can collaborate with the cities. That's the first step to a two from four. And let's explore what's out there. Until that's happened, I still don't I still isn't clear to me what the need for this motion is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It hasn't been clear to me in the lack of the progressive inquiry still remains.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Well, it's it I it's very clear that that the, the will of the council is to, uh, to not, not pass or to not support the city auditor looking at bids, which is questionable to me. Right? Because it has been stated by the city attorney that that they are entities of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And that public resources are going through these these agencies. And there should be greater transparency and accountability. Right. I don't think that any business improvement district has ever had any sort of of of public audit to this point.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so, again, the thought was just a matter of good government, right? Responsible government, making sure that we are crossing our T's and dot in our eyes. And and this this council ultimately is is going to be held responsible.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now, when members of the public are questioning the integrity of any public entity. Right. Or any agency. They come to us. They hold us accountable as a council. Right. They're not going to go to, unfortunately, Mr. Cogen, because not an elected official.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You're not going to go to torture Hunter. She's not an elected official. They're going to go to their elected official and question. And and oftentimes we do get these questions as. As elected officials from disgruntled business owners or individuals who have had some sort of business with with the with the bid for one reason or another.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This, I think, protects them. This this this motion my motion actually helps the bid's in increasing, like I said, public confidence in the integrity in which their business is done. And like I said, I have no reason to question the integrity of the bids in any area of the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think it's important for us to put controls in. And so I'm going to stand on my motion and ask that members you support, then reconsider some of your positions. Because I don't think walking away and turning the your head to turn and turning a blind eye to where public funds are actually being.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Utilize is a responsible approach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor. One question about this motion. Would this be if for free? I don't have it in my district. Not right now. But I'm working on one. And my fear is, is that if we pass this motion as a substitute, as it's currently worded, I'm afraid that any future implementation of a permit in my district, as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'an example, would add another another step in that process of them doing an audit. And I have to correct I have to state that when we use the city auditor to do an audit, it is not an independent audit, it's our audit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're ordering it. And she is our auditor and I'm. And when the P do their audits, I'm guessing you're using an independent auditor. So I would not and not to besmirch the city auditor's job, but there's already an independent audit in place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is duplicative, as I said before. So I'm going to call a question on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a the question has been called, is there is there any objection to go to a vote?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I object. I'd like to say to object.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's objections. So?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So on a call for the question is not available. Is there a second on the call?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second? Is your second call for the question. Councilman Pierce. So. So we'll take a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vote a second. And it would have to pass by a majority of six votes in favor in order to call for the question. No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You drop it, I withdraw it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so we're going to move on to Councilwoman Mongo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for withdrawing your comment because I feel that some of the things that have been said, I just I'm going to say I hope that they weren't intended to me because I, I personally do support auditor out doing audits of anyone she and her staff determine need to be audited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's how much I trust her. She is the most supported elected official in our city, in my opinion, and if she thought that this was important, I would completely 100% support her. And after tonight, she can still do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I have a hesitation with is. I don't see all the beds here or COBR and all the other groups, and I don't have relationships with all of them because they're not in my district. But but I do not take a blind eye to any of them, even when they are not in my district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will continue to utilize the process currently in place that I do believe in. Of the annual reports. Tosha, you and I have only met once, but I thought you did an exceptional presentation a few weeks ago and similar to the comments from Councilman Price.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've shared your story already with the board of our Volunteer Spring Street Business Association, and they want to meet you and hear about what you're working on. And when I think of those presentations, I think of that. And so not for the reasons that you'd mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and to be honest, before you mentioned those, I was leaning toward supporting your substitute substitute. But but for the reasons that I stand on the grounds that the city has a process. And if we want to change that process, I think we should do it with support of COBA and the leaders of those organizations, because as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mentioned last week, it's hard to get people to volunteer. This is the first time in our city's history that we only have 24 vacancies on commissions. I have often asked people to step up and be on commissions and the commitments and the scrutiny and the form seven hundreds and all those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're deterrents and I support them and I thank them for their service and I think them for what they put in. And I do think that there are certain. Bits that perhaps could use an audit more than others.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that that is at the discretion of the person with the certification. And and for that, I'll support the. Second motion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We're going to go to Councilman Price, Councilman Gonzales, and then vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Price. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to try to keep it quick, but I will say I don't understand this whole calling for the question concept. I've been on this body now for a year and a half, and it wasn't until very recently that people started doing that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really don't understand that at all. We all represent our constituents. We we worked very hard to get in these positions. We should be able to talk as much as we want about an issue. I mean, imagine being able to be going back to your constituents and saying, you know what, I didn't even have enough votes to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'express my opinion on the item. I mean, I just we should at least be able. It's I understand it's late, but we all ran for public office. And that includes a lot of positives and a lot of negatives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And working late is one of the negatives. And allowing your colleague to speak on an item that they feel is important that they should speak on is is the basic of respect that we should be showing one another?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's just my opinion. I will never, ever ask to call the question if one of you has something to say about an item ever. That's my commitment to my colleagues. If you feel you need to say something for your constituents, I will never cut you off from that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just we never did that before. I have no idea what's happening. So I would just ask us to really think about that. You know, I, I did reach out to the bid in my district and spoke with them at length about this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're on board. They're fine with the item. I did speak with Jim Fiske. He was fine with the item as well. His concern was whether or not our bids were going to have to take on an additional cost to, you know, respond to the audit, which I think the city auditor has done a good job with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you read the item on its own, which is what I did when I signed on to the item, it makes a lot of sense. And to me, if we were talking about any other issue, I can't imagine our council would have a problem with what it's asking for, which is establishing best practices for something that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are utilizing in the city and hope to utilize, more of which is bids. And I think I have to be quite honest, I think there's something else going on here that's beyond what's written on this item, and I don't know what that is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the item is a good item. I think the intent behind the item is a good item. I don't know. I sense and I could be totally wrong, but I sense there's something else going on that that is not readily apparent from the four corners of this document.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. You know, one of the things I was listening to NPR the other day and they were talking about Joe Biden. And one of the things that his colleagues were saying across the board was whether they disagreed with him or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He never questioned their motives. And we do that every once in a while here. And I don't get that. I really don't. You know, we can disagree, but, you know, questioning one another's motives is just ugly and unnecessary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think if you read this item and step aside, it's basically saying if you look at the last paragraph, we've several bids have been in place for many years. Others have recently been established, given the important role of business districts in supporting and promoting our business and property owners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be beneficial for the city auditor to review these districts and associations and provide recommendations and best practices to assist bits and pieces, especially those in which the city is a major stakeholder. If you look at it for what it says and don't read beyond it, I think it's a very reasonable item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe I'm totally wrong on that. I'd like the substitute substitute, because what it's saying is if you are a bid that obtained an independent audit, we don't have to do another audit. You can provide that data. And I think that takes care of some of the concerns that were that were raised by De Alba, who's represented if'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we need to do more outreach, maybe we should do more outreach. I just I don't think that the item on its face. Is all that I think is being insinuated. It is. And if if it is, I'm not aware of that because I'm reading this document, which seems very reasonable to me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, I think if we were to step back and say, is this something that we would support absent the personalities absent, then we should support it. I just I hate to have personality come in the way of policy if we think it's a good policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think best practices are an excellent idea. I think the auditor helping us get there is a fantastic way for us to to do it together in a consistent fashion. So with that, I turn the floor over and I thank you for indulge me with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Three point blank seconds of dialog. I hope that didn't set everyone back too far in their night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I appreciate the dialog. Just really quickly, I just I'm not understanding why none of these questions were raised during each of the approval processes for each of the bids that we had over the year. And so that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we we stood here and we talked to in many of the business improvement districts, they came, they presented. We told them how great they were. No questions. No questions. And so now we're we're looking to do this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't think any business improvement district has a problem doing the audit. I don't think that's the issue. There is no question behind that. I just think in terms of process like we've talked about, in terms of just being able to have communication lines open, it's just a little it's a little much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. And I'll just respond to Councilmember Gonzalez, because you you you quote, you said, we need to put a framework in place. This item asks for our city auditor to look at best practices. Right. You said that you don't believe that any of the bills have are opposed to doing this, but the city council is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That doesn't make sense. That doesn't make sense for council members who have who have serious stakes in this in this process. We all support our bids. And yes, last week the Uptown came and gave a presentation weeks before that to be back, even gave a presentation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we love them for their excellent work. We want to continue that. Don't don't get me wrong. This is not an attack on our our business improvement districts. And that's what I think the the that has been the intent or the frame that that way it's not an attack on them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is something to just improve our processes to make sure that we're streamlining and everybody is understands across the city that, you know, the city auditor may come in and and do an audit to to make sure that the books are good and that and in doing that, our residents, our businesses are going to feel a lot'",
        "'speaker_10': 'better about the process. They're going to feel good about their bids, as they hopefully do about their city city government, because it's a lot more transparent. That's the intent of the motion. And again, I would ask for you to support it, because I don't think anybody has anything to hide here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kate, thank you very much. There is a vice mayor Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I just want to just say a couple of things, though. Some dog whistle politics. Something's going on. There's more to the story. I didn't place this agenda item on the on the city council agenda. And I don't think the other one turning our heads.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't I didn't hear anybody here say, turn your heads. What we're saying is open your eyes and turn around your ears. Look at what's available first. Set a baseline and a justification for why we want to impose something on our business community, which is very important to many of us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And look at what's available. Key word, collaboration. It's a few red flags here. No heads up to Cuba. Both of the business districts in North Long Beach in uptown. No heads up to them or their boards. No heads up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No courtesy call or anything. No, no. No one knew anything.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That that's that's the assumption.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'What is the rush like? Do your own homework. Let's look at what we have. Do the work of doing the diligence that is good public policy, that is good governance and built confidence in our business districts. And then and you have my word, I will support it if if the stuff comes back and there's additional things we'",
        "'speaker_8': 'need to look at. Great. But this is not how the city council should operate. And there is no there's something else going on here. I just think this like if anything else, someone said, take yourself out of it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if anything else was happening, if we just jumped out of the blue and said, let's go, you know, do a performance evaluation on city manager randomly, that implies that there's a performance issue that provides you you want to know what the greater context is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's what's happening here. So if there's greater context, we all want to know. Put it on the table if that's what it is. Otherwise, start do what we're asking for. We will go down this path with you. But let's show some progressive sort of inquiry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's find out what's there and do it. Partnership with all our business districts. It's just too many questions here. So. So I felt the need to sort of justify based on the dog whistle comments tonight.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to clarify that the city auditor is is independent, just as other independent auditors are are independent. So I needed to clarify that result. And I think the independent audits that the P bids and the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A's are receiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are different than what our office would be looking at. So we would ensure that business owners and property owners are receiving the intended benefits that their assessments are supposed to give them, that there is approximately $11 million annually coming in from assessments in the ten and a half years that I've been the city auditor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are never there never has been an internal control audit on the p bids or to look at whether or not the businesses and property owners are receiving the intended benefit, whether or not the city is providing adequate oversight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whether or not. The contract is they are in compliance with the contract. So there are a lot of questions that I don't think have been looked at that we would be looking at. So if the council. Voted to approve this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's when we would take that as a priority. According to our audit plan, we would we would move this item up in priority to what we were planning to do. If the item is not passed, then we would.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Step would we take next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Auditor. Just as we're going to go and go to a vote and as also as a reminder, I think whether the council votes for the sub sub or the sub. Obviously our city auditor has the ability to audit any, any, any group, anything associated with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're public dollars are involved. And so I think that's something that you had mentioned right now. And so I think it's important for the council to know that her and her team can and will audit any area of the city, I think, regardless of this vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have we have a sub sub first. So I want to make sure I'm clear with the subset which is Councilmember Austin sub subs. Then we have the substitute motion which is Councilman Janine Pearce and then back to the main motion.'",
