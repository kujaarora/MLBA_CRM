    "Recommendation to approve naming the North Branch Library, the \"Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library,\" in honor of her contributions to youth, education, literacy, and the United States.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Communication from Councilmember Richardson, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, Councilwoman Price, Councilman and Con Councilman Austin recommendation to consider naming the new North Branch Library, the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library, and refer this item to the Housing and Neighborhood Committee for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. With that, I'm to turn this over to Councilmember Rex Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I'm honored to make this presentation tonight of this historic proposal. Before I begin, I want to thank our fellow co-sponsors for their support, Vice Mayor Lowenthal, Councilwoman Price and Councilman Austin. I believe and predict that north long beaches best days are ahead of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also believe that the best way to predict the future is to create it. The youth of our community represents the future of our community, and I believe we should do everything we can to inspire and empower the next generation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That means making sure the investments we make into the physical environment of our community, not just add to the esthetics and property value of a neighborhood, but also connect with and inspire the next generation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Richardson, sorry about this. I have to make this announcement because it's due to another item. And I don't want those folks having to be here if they don't have to be. Item 16 has been an item 16 has been withdrawn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those who are wondering about that item. It's actually coming back at a later time. But I just wanted to make sure some of the folks knew that. And so back to the councilmember. Thanks. Sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the youth of our community represents the future of our community. And I believe that we should do everything we can to inspire, empower the next generation. And that means making sure the investments we make into the physical environment of our community, not just add to the esthetics and property value of a neighborhood, but also connect with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'us and inspire that next generation. I believe libraries should inspire the next generation. Our new state of the Art North Library is an opportunity to inspire, and I believe that we can and should utilize this library as a means to inspire young people to retire and to go further.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So before I get into the details of my proposal, I think it's appropriate to help walk through walk the public through how we got here. Over the past few months, I've had the opportunity to engage with students from Jordan High School about the new library.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A concept has come from those initial conversations that I believe is absolutely amazing. The concept is to name the new North, the new North Neighborhood Library in honor of First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama. After the initial concept from one group of students, we shared this idea with staff from Hamilton Middle School and students from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hamilton Hamilton Middle School, as well as youth from Andy. Andy Street Community Association. The Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library sparked that same enthusiasm and excitement among those young people. Then we took the next step of sharing this idea with every neighborhood association president in District nine to get their input and feedback.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of the ten presidents we spoke with, all ten not only supported the idea, but publicly added their names to the list of co-sponsors. We've tried over the past few years to work closely with our school district leaders, so we took the additional step of sharing this concept with school board member Megan Kerr, who also enthusiastically supported'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this idea. And finally, knowing that this library has taken many years to come to fruition, we took the additional step of reaching out to the last two generations of District nine member council members about the idea, and former council member Steve Neal added his support to the idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So given the broad level of support in the community, it's made sense to take the next step of evaluating what the First Lady stands for and how that aligns with the North Long Beach neighborhood. First Lady Michelle Obama is a mother, wife, lawyer, writer, an amazing first lady.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She has become a role model for women and an advocate on poverty, awareness, education, veterans issues and healthy living a product of public schools. Michelle Robinson studies sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidney in Austin, where she later, later met Barack Obama, who would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'become president of United States. After a few years, Ms.. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as an Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development in Chicago City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago Chapter of Public Allies and AmeriCorps program that prepares you for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'public service. In 1996, Ms.. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as vice president of community and external affairs, volunteerism skyrocketed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ms.. Obama continues her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as first lady. She has four main initiatives as First Lady that very closely aligned with the North Long Beach community. The first is joining forces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans and their families in support them through wellness, education and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that servicemembers, veterans and their families have the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. And as you may know, North Long Beach has been hosting our Veterans Day Parade and vet fest for many years. The play parade runs along Atlantic Avenue in the and next year, the march, we will march right in front of our new, new library.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Her focus is her focus on the needs of. Veterans very nicely aligned with our community. The second is let's move in 2010. Ms.. Obama launched Let's Move, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents and others in a nationwide effort to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In alignment with this initiative, the City of Long Beach is proud to be a Let's Move city as we passed the resolution for this initiative in October of 2010. Also in alignment for the past four years, North Long Beach Community has been deemed a healthy eating, active living healing zone through support through the through support that the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Health Department received from Kaiser Permanente and the Coalition for Healthy North Long Beach. The work of the heals on the Coalition has made strides in creating a healthier environment for all ninth District residents. The First Lady's third initiative that closely aligns to our new library is the Reach Higher Initiative in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ms.. Obama reached launched the Retire Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across the nation to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a at a professional training program, a community college or a university.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It aims to ensure all students understand what they need to do to complete their education by encouraging academic planning, summer learning opportunities in school and afterschool. Extracurricular enrichment. The same type of enrichment that will be provided by our North Neighborhood Library.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fourth and final initiative is called Let Girls Learn. In 2015, the Let Girls Learn initiative was launched, and it's a U.S. government wide initiative to help girls around the world to stay in school and stay involved. This this global initiative is also well, well aligned with the purpose of our library.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I like to play take a moment to play a video that highlights the first lady's work on education and her commitment to helping our young people succeed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is nothing more important to this nation's future than investing in our young people. And education is at the top of the priority list. Now we know that as adults, we know that as administrators. Now we have to put our efforts where our knowledge is, and we have to make sure that young people understand that reality as'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Choice but to achieve this goal. It's a tough one, but nothing good comes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Easy, so we don't have a choice. We have to reach that North Star.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I know that there were some technical issues, but I think you guys get the gist of it. So. Now, I think it's important that we consider the context for this proposal. First, consider that we're in a period of time where the largest retailer in the world, Amazon, has no inventory.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uber, the world's largest taxi company, has no vehicles. Facebook, the world's most popular media owner, creates no content. And Airbnb, the world's largest accommodation provider, owns no real estate. Is it smart to say that the traditional role of libraries will change as well?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This also means reevaluating the purpose of institutions like libraries simply from depositories, from books to hubs for community community resources with a much broader focus from community and life skills learning to career development and job search. So but by changing the way we think about libraries, we should also think about the way we intentionally connect our environment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the next generation. And I believe we can do a better job of ensuring our communities can connect with and identify with our local facilities and infrastructure and landmarks. Here is a list of 19 public institutions in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Zip Code 90805 listed our seven parks, 11 schools and one neighborhood library. When you break down how these North Long Beach institutions are named, only 11% of them are named after women. Two are 19. Only 11% of them are named after people of color.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Two out of 19. And of those institutions named after individuals, 63 are named after 63% are named after national figures. All of these figures have tremendous stories and legacies. Can you honestly say that our city has done the best job we think we can of making sure our youth are connected with and inspired by the facilities we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'dedicate? Now let's compare this to some of our demographics here in the north Long Beach area. According to the latest data of the American Community Survey, approximately 30% of our population are youth. 27,924. And by both population count and percentage, we are the largest and youngest zip code within this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And our youth are extremely diverse. Most diverse. Most notably, 90% of our youth age under 18. And under our youth of color. What does that mean for our future when 93% of our youth can only connect or identify with eight with 11% of the facilities in their community?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This past weekend, I went and watched Star Wars and I noticed on the Star Wars movie how they intentionally diversify the lead roles in their cast. Women lead an African-American first mate and a Latino pilot. And if Disney can get it, I think we should get.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Should we be surprised if we don't see the kind of community ownership we'd like to see and have is if we don't see the kind of community ownership we'd like to see out of our young people. And if we have issues with vandalism and graffiti.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a study that came out in 2005 called Creating Culturally Responsive Schools that studies that states cultural. Cultural disconnect often leads to poor self-concept, discipline, problems in poor academic outcomes for ethnic minorities. While the library is not a school, I think the sentiment it expresses remains true for youth in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're in a moment in time in North Long Beach called the Uptown Renaissance. This is a period where our residents are more engaged than ever while we're making significant investments in our infrastructure parks, schools, public institutions. But we missed the mark.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we don't inspire the next generation and create a new sense of pride in our community. Sometimes this means thinking differently, considering new approaches, and having the courage to stand up to the forces who resist change. According to the 2010 census, 70% of 90805 residents have moved to nine out of five since the year 2000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This means that North Long Beach today is a community of newer citizens, younger families who have helped to not only continue the up the uptown renaissance, but to re-energize it. So next steps, the next step of our if our proposal passes this evening, will be to have the Department of Parks, Recreation, Marine and our Library Services Department'",
        "'speaker_3': 'conduct further outreach around this concept with our park and library patrons. Secondly, the Council Council's Housing and Neighborhoods Committee will discuss and consider the proposal. And finally, I've committed to our Long Beach Library Foundation that my office will host a community forum in in January to further discuss the proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will be very well publicized and open. Now I have a few a few clarifying questions for staff. Number one, I've heard issues about this proposal being precedent setting in terms of naming a building for a living person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has the city done this before? And are we outside of the scope of our authority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Mayor, members of the council? Councilmember Richardson. We actually do have policies in place through an administrative regulation that is advisory to the Council for naming facilities, and we've done facility naming as many times before. There are actually some provisions in our air that talk to, you know, this type of process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And actually, just recently, the council went through a process, the same process to name the Internet, you know, center theater against I'm sorry, for former Mayor Beverly O'Neal. So we have been through this process before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And along that same lines, I'm going to ask Mr. City attorney, what is the spirit of our current naming policy? And are we within the spirit of the regulation of the regulation?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilman Richardson, members of the city council, I guess if I had to summarize the spirit of it, is that the buildings and facilities, public buildings and facilities owned and operated by the city that we are attempting to name after a living person, should be named after someone who has made a significant contribution either to the nation, the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'city of Long Beach or the state of California. And I think you've just gone through and articulated why Michelle Obama would fit in one or more of those categories. So that is the underlying spirit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And back to Mr. Assistant City Manager. How would you compare? In terms of process, I've heard questions about process. How would you compare the process that we've outlined and the process we're beginning tonight to other recent other processes in recent history of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the typical process as outlined in the air is for an idea to come to the city council. The city council then refers that to the Housing and Neighborhoods Committee, what is now today called the Housing Neighborhoods Committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then it comes back to the council. As I understand the motion before us, what is being proposed is an additional public outreach process on top of the standard process that the city uses, as I understand it, to include additional outreach that library and parks would do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in addition to the efforts that Councilmember Richardson is currently working on, and then bring that to housing and neighborhoods, and then again back to the city council for a decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So traditionally, the first point of a process is what?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are a couple of ways that it can start. It either can come from the community to the as a filing with the city clerk to the city council's attention. Typically, it does come with a motion or agenda item from a city council member to agenda, or is it at the city council level and then referred to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing and Neighborhoods Committee for further review before it comes back to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So would you consider that this process was premature in any way compared to any naming process in recent history that you recall?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, this is following the same process and actually adds additional steps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this has additional steps than what we followed in recent history in the past?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just wanted to clarify, typically, does the city does the city of Long Beach or city staff engage in this type of outreach before the city council submits a proposal to engage?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not in recent memory. Perhaps in the past some of these have been staff driven. In recent memory, I can't recall any that were generated by the city staff. It normally comes from the city council and then goes through the process as outlined before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So. So that's it. This proposal is historic, but not precedent setting in nature. We've gone above and beyond the outreach process that we've established in the past, and the process is well within our scope of the law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that said, I move the motion as written as for my colleagues for support and may the force be with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. There's there is a motion and a second on the floor. And so we have some council comments and then I may open up to the public. So Councilmember Austin, who made the second thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll be very short and brief. I think my colleague really did a great job. I want to congratulate our council member, Richardson. It may the force be with you all as well. I think he did a good job of making the point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is a I think I've known Councilmember Richardson for many years. We've had many conversations about the future of our city, the future of North Long Beach. And I know before he got elected and when he first got elected, he talked about doing things big.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is big. This is a big step for Long Beach is a big step for our shared community. And this is will be something that is bigger than both Councilmember Richardson and any of the councilmen council people up here, because naming this library will be something that stays with this community for many, many years to come'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in perpetuity. And so this is a big, bold decision that I support wholeheartedly, and I don't think there's anything else to be said there. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Gonzales.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank you. So I have, of course, my own comments to make. And then Councilwoman Woman Price, she's out for surgery, but she asked me to say her comments as well. So I just want to thank as well Councilman Richardson for and our council colleagues for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I myself used to live in North Long Beach. So when I talk to my mom about all the things that are going on, she's really amazed at how beautiful North Long Beach is turning out with, of course, medians and new storefronts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But now something like this, that the fact that we're able to call potentially a beautiful library after Michelle Obama is wonderful. She is a woman with integrity and advocate for local youth literacy and veterans. She's our first lady.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I certainly believe why she would qualify for this. I don't know if we need further explanation or to continue talking about why she needs to be selected for this. And I wholeheartedly believe that. I remember when the vice mayor, Robert Garcia, at the time wanted to name Promenade Park after Harvey Milk.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know that there was a lot of pushback for that. And now we finally have a park, the only one in in the nation that's named after Harvey Milk. And now potentially we can have the only place named after Michelle Obama, which is even more wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I believe in this name and fully support this idea. I asked my colleagues to do the same and and certainly support not only us here on the council, but also everyone here tonight, especially North Long Beach. And and for looking at and thinking of North Long Beach in a broader scope, which is always very important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you. And then I'll move on to Councilwoman Price's comments. So she says, I regret that I am not here this evening to share my thoughts with my colleagues directly. I had foot surgery yesterday, and despite every intention to be here tonight, the recovery process seems to be more involved than I had forecasted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to thank Councilman Richardson for opening the discussion on this item. I know that the opening of the North Library is a very exciting development and a huge step in the effort to empower Uptown. Over the past week, I have received many emails and calls from my constituents, some of whom are very involved in some way'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in supporting our libraries. I have also talked with Councilman Richardson about his vision for this process based on the agenda item as worded, the possibility of naming the library after the first lady is something that is only in the preliminary phase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The process will involve discussion at the commission level and with stakeholders such as users, the Library Foundation and residents of Long Beach. I understand and respect Councilman Richardson's reasons for wanting to name the library after the First Lady.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do believe, however, that there is, since such a decision, would be a departure from our naming policy. This item should serve to initiate a longer, more transparent process, which will involve involved most certainly more public outreach. That is her comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And thank you. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, I have Vice Mayor Lowenthal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank Councilman Richardson for bringing this item forward. I know that. When many of us joined the city and the city government, we were all tutored in the way things were done and the way things had to be done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I champion any one of us, especially Councilman Richardson tonight, who takes a step forward to recognize somebody while they are still in the thrust and throes of doing the work that they do. And so I do believe in honor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do believe in honoring tradition and protocol. But I think there are times where it's completely appropriate to step aside and say that an individual in our nation or in our community is worthy of being recognized. And what better way to do it in a time when that individual is still working to advance the causes that they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are working on? And our first lady takes a stand on issues that I think really is meaningful for all of us educating girls. A lot of us have focused on the disparities of opportunities in developing nations, but we have those same disparities here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for a high profile celebrity brilliant figure, to take on that cause is something that's very much about Long Beach. And I'm personally honored that we are a city that does things first when others don't want to take the chance or risk doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is worth doing. And I thank you for that, and I thank you for coming forward with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mayor. When I had my voice in support of this motion, I think that Councilmember Richardson has done a phenomenal job and presented it to us, does his research, and I am especially encouraged by the transparency of the whole thing that he's going to be having some public input on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is going to be kicking around to the community. Certainly there's nothing to be hidden in regards to the intent of the of the naming of the library, I think is very inspirational. And it would be a great opportunity for our children to go to the library to learn more about our first lady, our first African-American first'",
        "'speaker_5': 'lady, to learn more about diversity and embracing diversity. I think that's the most important message that this stimulus library does is precisely that. And the force is with us. Thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and go public comment and we're going to come back I'm going to make some comments as well once this comes back to the council. So we turn this over to public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please line up and just make sure you say your name for the record and please begin.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To make sure that the kids. Good evening. Mr. Mayor and city council members. My name is Tanya Thresh into a Long Beach resident. And in the north and in the north, Long Beach Library Service area. I'm here to speak in strong support of naming the new library in honor of First Lady Michelle Obama.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm proud to stand here today with a room full of colleagues and esteemed friends who are raising signs saying yes to Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is a proud mother, wife, accomplished lawyer and public servant. First Lady Obama has been a champion for veterans families, healthy food exercise programs, and an advocate for improving children's literacy through the Read'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Across America campaign. Naming the new library will send a strong message to all of our daughters and future generations of children in North Long Beach. They, too, can go to Princeton. They, too, can have a Harvard Law School degree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Reading and education are the pathway to that unlimited opportunity in our country. By naming the new law library after First Lady Michelle Obama. We will not only help to increase the public space here in North Long Beach, but this new state of the art facility will inspire our community to be more civically engaged, utilizing this new safe'",
        "'speaker_4': 'space for community forums, Girl Scout meeting, sharing new ideas and interacting with one another. I believe that this is a powerful, positive and wonderful concept. I find it a bit troubling that there's some opposition to even bringing up this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know the Press Telegram editorial board does not speak for me. Why can't we have a public conversation about renaming our local facilities? You know, there's an Eleanor Roosevelt High School in North Carolina, even though she was born and spent most of her life in New York City.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Laura Bush has a library named after her in Austin, Texas, even though she's from Midland, Texas. Naming public naming our facilities. Public facilities for living public figures has become incredibly common, as we've heard over the last 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This proposal is about moving Long Beach forward to be a more representative of our city of today and not just yesterday, as was stated. Today, more than 80% of long beaches youth are students of color. Why would we not like to have a role model like Michelle Obama named for one of our local libraries?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight, I would ask you to move forward with starting this process. I believe that this is the right thing to do and it sends a positive message not only to my daughter, but to others, young people across North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I look forward to your affirmative vote tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who's going to go first? Good evening, City Councilor. Mayor My name is Current Bash and I am a fourth grader at Longfellow Elementary School and proud and a proud member of Girl Scout Troop 5193. I came out tonight to say yes to naming the new North Long Beach Library after the first lady, Michelle Obama.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am nine years old and I love to read. I am currently reading Key to the Treasure by Peggy Park. Michelle is that Michelle Obama is the only first lady I have ever known. I will love to finish reading Keys to Treasure in a library named after her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To me, she is a beautiful, smart and fun and I hope to be boss like her when I grow up. Please vote tonight to tonight to name my local library after Michelle Obama. As you make your decision, may the force be with you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And I would like to ask to put up your pink signs if you are supporting. Dear Councilman Rex Richardson. My name is Corrina Williams and I am a student at Hamilton Middle School in North Long Beach, California.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I support naming our new library, the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library. One reason the library should be named after Mrs. Obama is because she inspires me every day. When I was in fourth grade, a boy made fun of me because I am half black.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sometimes when I got in my head, I would show him how it feels when someone talks to you like that. However, I told myself not to let it bother me and I would to think of Michelle Obama. She's black and successful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I grow up, I will be like her. This is why I feel it is appropriate to name the library after Michelle Obama. She inspires us minorities here in Long Beach. My second reason is that she donated $250,000 to local library so kids can read, learn from the books, get good grades and go to college.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She even says one of her rap songs. So you had with knowledge. She shows that through reading books. You can learn a lot and get good grades to go to college. Here are some reasons why some people think the library shouldn't be named after her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One reason is because people might think she is selfish because she wants a library named after yourself. Another reason is that she is not a Long Beach native. People who do not like Michelle Obama might graffiti the library and say things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Overall, she is a great role model, believes in higher education and motivates us to read. In conclusion, I think Michelle Obama should have the new library named after herself because she is a very inspiring Obama. I hope that this shows you that the library should be named after Michelle Obama.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sincerely, Corrina Williams. Dear Councilman Rex Richardson. My name is Bilal Siddique and I am a student at Hamilton Middle School. I am in in North Long Beach, California. I am supporting our new library now. Michelle Marie Oberman Neighborhood Library.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Michelle Obama once said, If we want to go to college, fill your head with knowledge. This shows that she inspires people to go to college. The library should be named after Michelle Obama because she donated $250,000 to local libraries and she cares about education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Also, she is not a shy person. She made a rap song and went on The Ellen Show. Michelle Obama wrote in her rap, A dream is just a dream is just a dream until you go hard. In other words, this means that a dream is just a dream until you get an education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Michelle Obama is energetic. She can relate to us young people because she made a dance challenge to encourage encourage people to exercise. And another reason is because she is a role model. She encourages youth to take responsibility. Some people would say we shouldn't in the library after Michelle Obama because she is not a Long Beach hero.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would throw off the tradition for naming things after Long Beach Heroes. She didn't live in Long Beach, but she lived in South Side, Chicago. She can relate to us because because these are both low income cities. To conclude, we should name the library after Michelle Obama because she'd be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She cares about the impact of education on youth. Also, with only 80% of Long Beach High School students graduating on time, this library can make it at least 90% of students graduating on time. It will help them with resources and studying.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So these characteristics show why we should name the library after Michelle Obama. Sincerely Bloom City.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Shirley Brassard, senior consultant, Swarm Group and Associates. I intended not to be in town tonight. However, when I read through the Gazette that this meeting was coming and this motion was being forwarded, I thought, okay, this might be the reason why I'm still here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And initially I had a question which I will state after my statement. If Mr. Richardson had recommended his mother. Receive the name of the North Long Beach Library. Many people would wonder why. They might consider honorable, but they would wonder why.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some would probably laugh if he would name his the library or propose a motion to name the library after his wife. Some, again, would think it was honorable and somebody might look at him sideways. But in bringing forth this motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That this library would be named in honor of our nation's first African-American first lady, Michelle Obama. Nobody has to wonder why. Across the globe. No one will have to wonder why. Even those who might find reason to disagree.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They can't wonder why. Before the end of time. And this goes to whether or not we buy into the creationist theory or the evolutionist theory. But according to my studies before the end of time, God has to reconcile some things in the Earth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As we're forwarding our celebration of Christmas, those of us who celebrate that as being the birth of Christ, whether or not that December 25th is arguable, as we move forward to December 25th, we're going to have to at some point reconcile his birth, Jesus birth, his death and his resurrection.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some a fast forward for a minute into next year. This time next year, next year, we'll be celebrating Passover. Right before Jesus got ready to be hung on the cross that he was carrying. A black man was pulled out from the side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From North Africa. They just found their black man on the road and made him carry Jesus's cross. That same Jesus whose birth we will be, some of us celebrating a couple of days from now. History had to see a black man in the White House.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had to see it. That we would name that library after her is but a small token.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Greetings to the mayor and the council members. I am Clarissa Spencer and I serve as the President of the Lumbee Alumnae chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., a 102 year old public service sorority with over 250,000 college educated women from all over the world.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our chapter here in Long Beach was chartered in 1986. We are here today to support Councilman Richardson's recommendation to name the new North Branch Library, the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library. First Lady Michelle Obama stated, I believe that education is the single most important civil rights issue that we face today, because in the end, if we really want'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to solve issues like mass incarceration, poverty, racial profiling, voting rights and the kinds of challenges that shocked so many of us over the past year, then we simply cannot afford to lose out on the potential of even one young person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We cannot allow even one more young person to fall through the cracks. As First Lady Michelle Obama, through her national initiatives, has shown that education is the gateway to success. Specifically, the Reach Higher Initiative, which inspires every student in America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The initiative seeks to make sure our students understand what they need to complete their education, access to learning opportunities. A library can offer that having exposure to college and career opportunities. A library can definitely do that. And supporting families, schools, counselors and kids so kids have a safe space to learn and study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A library can definitely offer that too. In closing, the idea of the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library was initiated by the youth from the Long Beach Jordan rap program. Our kids have spoken and we should listen. They are our future leaders and I want their voices to be heard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I stand with them and for them in their support. Let us give our children a library in their community named after someone who they can positively, positively identify with and who 100% believes in literacy and education for all in the 21st century.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Honorable mayor, distinguished. Merry Christmas. My name is Dave San Jose. I was born here in Long Beach in 1940. I guess I must love this city because I'm still here. I want to give you a little bit of history about North Long Beach, which we always known as the orphans of the city'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I'm going to cut my stories a little bit short because I only had a few minutes one day. One of the students at Jordan High School went over after school and baseball practice. He was quite a baseball player.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Went over to a phone booth. A lot of you here don't even know what a phone booth is. He was called his girlfriend. All of a sudden, a drive by happened. He was shot and killed. Our community came together and said, What we need is a youth center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's start helping our kids. And so our big focus is and has been all about our kids. We were fortunate enough to start a program there. We had the Future Generation Youth Center, about the only youth center in the last ten years in Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was brought together because it was the right thing to do. And the community came and did that with all of our councilmen. Another thing that happened was all of a sudden we had redevelopment. Redevelopment came in and I think it was Jerry Schulz had mentioned that we could have a fire or a police station.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I never believed that we could do that. We got together, the community got together, and we fought it. And everything about it was a giant fight. Anyway, here we have one of the nicest police stations in North Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It belongs to us so we can be proud of. All of a sudden it came up that we can have a library. I mean, a fire station. And I think Bell was the councilman then. And we never believed that we can have that either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of a sudden, the community got together and we only had a three little three bedroom house for a fire station. And here he had these great big ideas that the community finally came up with the ideas of having this great big fire station.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we have one of the best fire stations in the city because we believe it. And the community came together. What this is really about. Then we had redevelopment and redevelopment came in and said, we can change our city, we can have new buildings, we can have all of these things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we don't have those things. Mainly what we have is a bunch of white fences. But one idea came up and it was the library and everybody with redevelopment. There were hundreds of people from this started 16, 17 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's when the idea first came about. And it was possible we could have a library. Not for us. I'm 75 years old. It's for the kids. We really need this up here in North Long Beach. And so we worked on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We worked on it. And the only money that we did set aside was the money for the library. So we do have a library. And that's the reason that I think the library should be named after its parents who gave it birth 17 years ago, the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did that for our kids because we care about our kids. I guess my time is up. Yeah, just got to wrap it up, so I got to give everyone the same amount of time. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. City council members. My name is Kate Huizar, and I'm the interim executive director for the Long Beach Public Library Foundation. I also my father and I both lived in North Long Beach for many years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like to first thank Councilman Richardson for getting the community so engaged and excited about naming the new North Library. The foundation feels strongly that residents of North Long Beach and residents of Long Beach should feel that they have an input in the library's name and their development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'After all, it is their library. Therefore, the foundation strongly supports the idea of hosting a community forum in which names can be suggested and discussed. And I know Council and Richardson, you've agreed, you know, that this is an extra step you should take.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We the foundation also looks forward is looking forward to a new main library and many other exciting civic projects throughout the city. It is important, as we have today, to be transparent about the process of naming, define and communicate the standards of criteria for such processes and include the Long Beach Committee and important decisions such as naming'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and others. There are many notable community leaders and literary icons deserving of this honor, and we look forward to learning the name of this, the name that the Long Beach community chooses for this library and those other institutions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whatever the name, the foundation is committed to supporting North the North Library by raising the much needed funds that will enhance it, creating a space that will best serve the community and be something that the community can truly be proud of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We look forward to working more closely with Councilman Richardson's office, among others, on our North fundraising campaign, engaging community members and business owners in his district and beyond. As an independent nonprofit, the Long Beach Community, Long Beach Public Library Foundation, excuse me, has provided over $20 million in support of our public library system in the past 18'",
        "'speaker_4': 'years. We have been actively involved in the North Library discussions and I personally look forward to meeting with all of the City Council members to further discuss the Foundation's plans to support the new North, the new main and other libraries in our city.'",

As a passionate educator, there's nothing more important than presenting the role models that inspire our children.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Someone that exemplifies the values, the philosophies, and walk the walk of what we hope to instill in our young people. Michelle Obama is that role model. So many of our young people finally, finally are relating to our first lady, whether it's in her background of grassroots organizing and going door to door in neighborhoods exactly like ours, advocating'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for those that are not always represented at the table, standing strong and addressing the issues of health and wellness are speaking on behalf of the value of education for our country. She understands our communities and stresses the values for progress for our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She has impacted our community in ways that have never been touched by a national leader. Only because we can relate and connect to the First Lady, Michelle Obama, in so many ways. We have been so excited for so very long about the transition of North Lawn Beach, going back many, many councilmembers and many mayors ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a new day in North Long Beach. Naming the library after a renaissance woman. A person who our community identifies with a national leader. First Lady Michelle Obama. A model of the leadership and altruism that we aspire for our youth and will exemplify in our vision for our community.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'I thank here today and support Councilman Rex Richardson's decision in May in naming the new library after Michelle Obama. We have named most of our public libraries and schools after presidents or famous authors. First Lady Michelle Obama is a lawyer and a writer.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Along with being the first. Along with being the wife of the 44th and current president of United States. Made her the first African-American first lady of the United States. Naming the library would be a symbol of gender equality.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'By demonstrating to us that we as citizens of Long Beach are making the change. Here is a quote by First Lady Michelle Obama. No country can ever truly flourish if it stifles the potential of its women and their private so of the contributions of half of its citizens by supporting a female role model.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And those messages and that's where I ended her quote by supporting female role models such as herself and becoming a role model. A role model for women and men. For advocating probably awareness, higher education and healthy living. So why not name this new library after Ms..'",

I'm committee sorry, where we had so much fun, met so many new people and at the end we ended up winning first and second place with'",

For example, last year as a freshman in high school, I had the opportunity to host one of his events called Community Conversations to discuss the Whole Village initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The reason I would like to name the library, the reason why I would like the library to be named after the First Lady, Michelle Obama is because just as Councilmember Richardson engages the youth, First Lady Michelle Obama has also launched many initiatives in order to inspire youth both in health and education.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, in 2014, she launched the Reach Hire Initiative, which is an effort to inspire youth, youth and other people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school. I am proud there is someone as high up in her studies who cares about the youth.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We are actually treated as young adults who have actually have a voice. Councilman Richardson allowed us to voice their opinion on naming the library the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library. A main reason on why US students, especially as US ladies and the Jordan Rapp ZAE Sisters program, will like to be naming this library after the First Lady is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'because she is a great inspiration and is seen as a role model to us women. An example given on how our First Lady inspires us youth is how she launched the US Government Worldwide Initiative. Not to let let girls learn to help girls around the world to go to school and stay in school.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It helps educate and empower young women. She's sharing stories and struggles of these young women to help inspire and have their own education. This relating to our program on behalf on how we as a diverse group of young females who focus on helping one another, empowering each other as women, we focus on reaching a higher education, even'",

She has also created a Web video where she motivates women to stay in school and go to college.

        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Richardson has brought this forward in a very thoughtful and thorough way with steps outlined in ways that the community can give meaningful engagement in this process. We know that the naming of public spaces and buildings is requires much reflection and even more so when we recognize and honor individuals by the nature of our humanity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'None of us is perfect and critics will find something wrong with any potential honoree. So in in this process, not only considering the contributions, but the context is incredibly important. Each generation will define for themselves who they find to be heroic, who they find to be role models.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as I stand here, the mother of children, the ages of people who just spoke to you, they're defining this very clearly as who represents them, who inspires them. I hear it again and again in the short time that we've been talking with this publicly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The response I get from children as young as ten and 14 is, That's great. She's so cool. They really understand that this is a person who speaks to them. And so as we continue to develop North Long Beach into the most technologically advanced and modern education corridor from the construction of Jordan High School, a potential community center'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and this library looking forward with this naming, is absolutely the right thing to do. And I thank you for your affirmative vote in moving this process forward.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Over the course of the last year, I've been to many city council meetings to support several initiatives that have been put forth this year to better Long Beach and better my community. Most of the time I choose not to speak, not because I don't feel like I have something to say or feel that I have a voice'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But because many of the voices advocating on behalf of our community are voices I trust to communicate the needs of the community I reside in and reflect the shared vision many of us have for the new trajectory we are paving in the Uptown Renaissance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today I stand before you because some of the voices weighing in on the proposal are not voices I believe accurately reflect the new North and this collective vision. And I want to make it unequivocally clear that I am genuinely excited about the prospect of naming our library after the current first lady.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And let me tell you why. With communities in transition just like ours in North Long Beach, it is important to have symbols to rally around, to demonstrate that there's something special about our community. These symbols can take a myriad of forms.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We currently have the opportunity to combine the pride and excitement we feel when we think about our brand new library with a public figure that inspires us to new and higher levels. Who encourages us to expect more from ourselves and more from those around us, including our elected officials?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A public figure that inspires the next generation, the next generation of future leaders of our great city of Long Beach. I think we can all agree that our goal in making Long Beach a destination city is to make sure all parts of Long Beach have destination points for local, regional, national and international visitors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right now, we in the north are in a time of rebranding. Determining what this new trajectory will look like and what legacies we will leave for the next generation. The old connotations and assumptions about North Long Beach are slowly fade into the background as the new short as the new North is being shaped and molded.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's continue to be progressive, to be out of the box thinkers and to be a community that inspires and aspires. So I will end with Go Long Beach and go uptown. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor. City Council. My name is Andy Kerr from the eighth District and I felt compelled this evening to speak on this issue for a couple of different reasons. First of all, I'm currently in the eighth District, but I spent the first 25 years of my life at Orange and 64th, right across the street from'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Grant Elementary School in North Long Beach. And so the North Long Beach community is very dear to my heart. And I still spent a lot of time there. And the North Branch Library was very important to me as I was growing up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I was very excited to hear a couple of years ago about the the new building that will be happening for that community and very excited about that. I was the first member of my family to graduate from college and in addition to my parents who threatened me within an inch of my life if I didn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also think the North Branch Library Library for teaching me a love of learning, a love of books because of the hours and the hours that I spent there. And the other issue I went to to speak on tonight was as a member of the Homeless Services Committee representing the eighth District and Councilman Austin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you, Mr. Mayor, and I've also have been a member, a board member of an organization named Housing Works, which provides permanent supportive housing for people who are chronically homeless, at risk of homelessness. And many of those people that that my organization and the homeless services people in the city of Long Beach have served have been veterans'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And Mrs. Obama has been an incredible leader on that issue. I have seen my organization, Housing Works, House Veterans, who have been on the streets, living on the streets virtually for my entire life from the Vietnam War era, and have seen them go to housing because of the leadership of Mrs. Obama, because the Veterans Administration now gets'",
        "'speaker_7': 'what it takes to end chronic homelessness among veterans. But it wouldn't have happened if it hadn't been for her leadership. And with. Because of your leadership, Mr. Mayor, and the council and our wonderful staff here, I'm proud to say that the city of Long Beach is on pace to reach the goals set by Mrs. Obama to end'",
        "'speaker_7': 'veterans homelessness in the city of Long Beach. And I'm very proud of that. So that's all I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Makes me feel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council Persons. I'm Liz Gonzalez. I'm an educator and a creative writer. And we are celebrating our sixth year as homeowners in North Long Beach in Eagle North.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is George Martin. I'm a biologist and musician and part of Uptown Ward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Together we run Uptown Word Reading and Arts Series, which we began in North Long Beach. One of our missions is to promote literacy and in addition to bring writers to North Long Beach that represent the community. And then that means people of color.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was so important to us to do this. We didn't have a venue, so we held pop up events every month. And starting next month, January, we will now have a home at North Branch Library. And we just wanted to say, as people who promote the letters, promote literacy and the arts, that we wholeheartedly support this recommendation'",
        "'speaker_4': '. As a girl, I grew up going to libraries and I would have loved to have had a role model like Michelle Obama and been able to attend a library named after her. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Charles Durning. I'm a 60 year resident of Plus of Long Beach. It's wonderful to hear the enthusiasm for this new library. And though I may offer up another alternative, it's like standing on the beach with a tsunami or global warming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We may all end up north Long Beach. But having said that. We do have a city policy in place, and I think that policy stands for a lifetime of service. We have many people in North Long Beach that that perhaps could qualify under that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I offer up two people that were husband and wife. They were Judge Marcus and Indira Hale. Tucker. Judge Judge Tucker was an African-American. He was the first judge to be put on a municipal court. He was long recognized for his position on youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if he had someone on probation and they didn't make their grades, he left them on probation. Indira Hale. Tucker had a passion for books. She she had a program at our libraries where the new kids could come in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And not only could they take out books, but they could take out toys. She she started the resource center for. The African American Society. She coauthored a book on the heritage of African-Americans in Long Beach with Aaron De.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She was a founding member, excuse me, of our Long Beach Public Library Foundation. I think the other thing that is a consideration and if we do go forward with this Mrs. Obama's name, I would challenge all of our counseling and council women.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The goal is to raise $700,000 for North Shore Branch Library for their computer learning center and the other electronic and books that they need. I would challenge you to be of assistance in raising that money so that we could have the best library possible in north our region.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And I'm going to I see a I'm going to close out the speakers listening to anybody else. There's two more. Okay. So I'm going to close off theirs. Okay. So after the next the folks that are coming up, I'm closing the speaker's list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening to the council, to Mayor Garcia. My name is Otis Hogan. I'm a member of the Human Relations Commission and chair of the Highland Park Neighborhood Association. I've been most inspired this evening by the people who are the community members who came before me, especially the young people who spoke earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But moving on as a 16 year old transplant to the city, the Long Beach Library and Long Beach Poly was what first inspired me to develop a lifelong love for Long Beach. So when it comes to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Library.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Project with love and appreciation, I believe the whole North Long Beach community is pleased and excited to see the new library take shape on Atlantic Avenue. I am here today inspired and excited at the prospect of this building being named after the First Lady.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I, for one, and I know many others in our community. Will be proud to be a patron and supporter of the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library. Thank you. Go uptown. Go Long Beach.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I'm Marco Cooper and I represent Andy Street, which is located in North Long Beach. And any street community is and supports Councilmember Rex Richardson's proposal to name the new library after Michelle Obama. The if you look at the demographic in North Long Beach, it consists of many African-Americans, according to statistics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People are more likely to associate themselves with places that they can relate to. Michelle Obama being African-American will shake more kids in the community. The library is named after her. The first lady is a great role model that the kids in our community can look up to, given that she has similarities with the youth in the city'",
        "'speaker_5': '. After construction is complete, the 25,000 square foot library will be a great location to get kids in the neighborhood, a place to get resources or do homework after school. However, more than that can be accomplished by naming it after the First Lady.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She's a perfect example of what hard work and determination can get you. People will always be more supportive of a person they look up to. Obama is a respected woman throughout the community because she's an advocate for education and has earned her own degrees at Princeton and Harvard Law School.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If Obama's name is attached to the new public library, it will send the message that if kids work hard enough, some day they will be able to accomplish as much as she had. Or even or maybe even more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'North Lawn Beach has improved over the past several years. However, we still have room for improvement, namely the new library. After Michelle Obama will give guidance and inspiration to kids throughout the community to strive day in and day out to reach their goals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the City Council approves the proposal, it could be huge for the community. It will give African-American kids hope, knowing that the biggest neighborhood branch library in the city is named after an African-American woman. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Obama. Neighborhood Library. I'm up here standing before you to speak to you for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My little niece that was just born in October.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because as she grows up, she's going to make her way to Grant Elementary School at Grant Elementary School. She's going to then go to the library and then the library. She's going to see this name, Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in that library, she's going to understand that she comes from North Long.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Beach, from the.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You to vote and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Say.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Where I came from. Now. It's a new.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Name. It's a new library.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A new direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because in North Long Beach, it's time for a new direction. It's time to be able to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'See someone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That mirror images or reflects who we are as.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A community. And in this community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are strong, we are intellectual, and we are thriving right now. This is the next phase of what North Long Beach will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Become in the next 22 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For Alyssa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My name is Charlie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Scott, the third.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, I'm speaking to you on behalf of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Michelle Obama.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Neighborhood Library. Vote for the library. Let's let's do something to make our youth proud of our.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Decisions in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mike. Speaker, please. And I have three more speakers and lady at the end is the last speaker. Lori Margaret Smith, you're in line. Okay. No, that's okay. So we have four more speakers. That's okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lori Angell. I've lived in North Long Beach since 1989. I've seen the neighborhood change substantially, yet I am still there. A lot of people left, but I am still there. And many like me stayed. And we fought for almost everything that people are enjoying right now, including the library.'",
        "'speaker_1': '15 years working on the library. Now, my head's getting turned a little bit today because first of all, Michelle Obama doesn't come up in my vernacular very often. I read the newspaper, I read magazines, I watch the news every single night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I watch intently. And I have not heard any of this about Michelle Obama before. So seriously, I am serious. I'm not lying. I'm being very serious.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's make sure everyone has a has a right to make their comments. And if I could just have the audience, please be respectful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate greatly getting the perspective of the individuals in the audience. That being said, I've been looking forward for 15 years for the completion of the North Branch Library to celebrate North Long Beach. What I am concerned about is that this is coming up now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're going to have to pay $47,000 to change this and change that and put in a new sign. Why didn't this come up two years ago? Why couldn't the why couldn't the neighborhood and the community discuss this two years ago?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why now? Why three days before Christmas? Is this coming up now? So that's my objection. I think the process is really fouled up and I'm disappointed that this is where we are. I've been speaking against this naming because I don't know who Michelle Obama is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know who she is. But I equate her to politics. I equate her to being the wife of who I consider a very good leader. And I don't feel that most first ladies deserve this kind of recognition. I would like to see President Hillary Clinton lie very personally, but that's just me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So good luck. I'm hoping for more discussion and I'm just a little disappointed that this wasn't better discussed in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Vice Mayor Lowenthal, City Council members. My name is Margaret Smith. I live in the third district. My address on file, and I am speaking as a former president and vice president of public affairs for the Long Beach Public Library Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are really, really excited to be a part of this discussion about the transformative potential of the new North Library.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many have asked us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What is the Foundation's position on the naming of North Library? You heard from Kate Huizar, our executive director. I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quickly summarize.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our key three positions. First of all, there is much discussion about who should be honored. We are not not taking a position on any specific individual. There are many deserving candidates. Let the community decide. Secondly, we are most concerned about the process, both for North Library and for future naming opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are glad to know that the process will be transparent and inclusive of the entire Long Beach community and we are very appreciative of Councilmember Richardson's commitment to that approach. Last. Whatever the decision about the name. As was said earlier, the foundation will continue its active campaign of support and fundraising to make this an amazing north library'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for all of the individuals here tonight and the entire community. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next speaker, please. 30 2:00 as they address a number of items. First of all, one of the things I think everybody can agree on when the time comes to make that announcement of who the library will be named after.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we select Steve Harvey, let's make sure that the teleprompter is working. Okay? My affinity for the library is not limited to the nexus I referenced last week relative to the having a relative that who designed the L.A. Public Library.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My mother was a librarian and in the small world department earned her degree from the same place that Eleanor Richardson. Who for 20 years was our director of Librarian Services. I went to school. I was. I clearly support the building of the library, in fact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you first announced it a number of months ago, I gave you the I think will probably be one of the first books there, The Boys in the Boat, which parenthetically, if you have not read, you should read.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is a tremendous, tremendous book. On what life was like in the deepest depths of the Depression in this country. Some of those experiences we're expressing, we're experiencing right here and now. One of the things and I mentioned this to Councilman Rex Richardson that struck me and I was a little disturbed about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see only the signs from one side. That tells me the process wasn't completely open, period. I've been down to this council chamber one or two times, and when there are major issues, they're generally people equally in number represented and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't see that here tonight. That's a little troubling. Equally troubling was the fact that people were referencing it's people of color. I don't give a rat's rear end what color somebody is, and that should not matter whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People are saying, well, right now we've got 90% or whatever the percentage of African-American. The realities are. With by the time ten years from now, 15 years ago, 15 years from now, that profile is going to change. And if you don't understand that, look at the changes, the population and the migrations into this country.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It might be Syria. It might be Muslim. It might be Irish. You never know. So let's check that at the door. Somebody once said, you know, it's not the content, it's not the color of the stain, but the content of the mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Equally important, if you want to. I think that would be an embarrassment to the first lady because she doesn't want to be seen as being elbowed. Elbowing your way in. Last comment. Time is up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Study Google and study the China. Thank you, Mr. Cole. You know, understand time is the time is out. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, honorable mayor. Members of the Council, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank you all for affording me the honor of speaking here tonight. Here are a few suggestions that I. That have an opportunity to please all involved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Just to get your name for the record.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll run it. I live in ninth district for tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I live in the ninth district. The policy in Long Beach is to name a public asset after someone who has been dead over a year. Although it can be overridden, it shouldn't be. There are solid, significant reasons for that policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Michelle Obama is still alive. The history books have not yet been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Finalized about her. And I'm sure the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Force is with her as well as everyone else here today. She will have a very long life ahead of her. With a lot more history to write. We cannot begin to predict that a person who is so young will always deserve the designation being proposed here today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, the aforementioned city policy does not extend to school districts. A suggestion would be to the youth of Jordan and all the other schools in Long Beach work at a designated special area in their school honoring the First Lady so that all of the future generations may be reminded every day of Michelle Obama as an inspiration for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their dreams, aspirations, goals and personal achievements. If the north Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'North Lawn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'North Library branches to be named after someone. There's strong support for the name Mr. Bill Baker. Also, Judge Tucker. I can find many facts that point to them as the reason the library has become a reality in our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Years before our current councilman took office. With all due respect. His support, their support over the years and dedication should be an inspiration to all of us where many may have given up. Another suggestion would be to honor our veterans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's strong veterans support in North Long Beach and the veteran theme is already going down Atlantic. Or just simply leave the library name in honor of our great city where I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Am proud to live. And have dedicated many hours to its improvement. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I think that closes public comment there. I think everyone spoke. Okay, good. So let me take this. Let me take this back and I'll make a few comments and I have a couple I have one other comment and then we'll go to to the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let me let me just say, first of all, that I want to thank everyone for coming. And regardless of, you know, what do you think the library should be named or shouldn't be named? This is important part of the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you all for coming. I especially want to thank and congratulate all the young people that came out tonight. And it it makes it makes me very proud that there's youth in our community, in our schools that are so active in what's happening in the city and the fact that they felt compelled to to come up'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with an idea about a name of a pretty important, significant building, public building that we're building. And the present that to Councilman Richardson, I think, is really, really special. And regardless of what you think of the name, I think that's something that should make everyone proud of our of our youth in the city of Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think just as a point of of, you know, of clarification and this has been brought up. We look at all of our institutions in Long Beach, and I think there's been a lot of great suggestions that have been that have been made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a we have what I would call a pretty decent mix of folks that are that our buildings are named after. Some are national figures. We're across the street from Lincoln Park or Cesar Chavez Park. Are there are more local to our history, whether it's Drake Park or other names that we've made?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some are or are authors or folks that we aspire or love something about, like Mark Twain, which was the last, I think, library name that we name that we that we chose for for our last big library in in central Long Beach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And sometimes we name things for folks that are that are still with us that have made great contributions like we just did for Beverly O'Neil, who is the former mayor of Long Beach. And so the city, I think, has always had a process in as long as I've been here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has always began with a councilmember from that district who was the elected representative of that district, would bring forward a name and a process for the council to consider. And I think that's what's what's happened through this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know not everyone loves a name and that's okay, but I think that's something that there is a process. And I just want to remind us that the actual agenda item is pretty clearly states for the council to consider this and then to begin a public outreach and deliberation process over the course of, I'm assuming, over the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'next few weeks or months. So that's all been said. Personally, I'll say that. When I think about particularly women and young women and young girls to be able to look up at a library and be able to see the name of someone that inspires them, that represents them, that looks like them, I think is something very, very'",
        "'speaker_0': 'special. And so I think I think our first lady is I, I think someone I read in a comment or somebody sent me an email that mentioned, you know, she's she's just the wife of the president. And I would say that he is probably the president because he married Michelle Obama.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I think that, you know, she probably anyone that she married would probably one day become the president. And so I think listen, I think she personally I think she is a incredible choice, that name on a public building, I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that doesn't also mean that there aren't other incredible names that could consider. And I think that's important to say, because she is a great a great name. But all the other names that have been mentioned, some great people in our own local history, I think in the press telegram mentioned three or four African-American leaders that have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'been very influential. They're all of value. And I think that's important to note for everyone. Everyone that's been named has done and made incredible contributions to our city. And we should value whether they're a national leader and they impact things like like our veterans or our education policies nationwide that affect our local schools or whether they're folks'",
        "'speaker_0': 'like were mentioned earlier, someone that led the way on legal issues. That was our first municipal judge. That was African-American or first African-American, a woman librarian. All sorts of different names are out there that are all worthy. Not one is not more worthy than than the other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They've all contributed. One thing that I the councilman and I mentioned earlier, and I want to make sure and I'll bring this up and I think that he is very open to this and I think is encouraging is when when when this gets built.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And over the course of the next few weeks, as we discuss this and the Library Foundation is involved and others are involved, there's a lot of people that went and were involved in the process of this library and a lot of great leaders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've heard actually a lot of great women that have been involved as well. And so I think that there's opportunities as we look at the library, whether they're reading rooms, whether they're spaces around the grounds to also be able to honor all of these great leaders, women, community leaders that all were a part of this important'",
        "'speaker_0': 'building. And so, Councilman, I'm hopeful that as this process moves forward, that regardless of what the final name ends up being, and I certainly know that the Michelle Obama name has a lot of support, that we look at ways of honoring all of our local champions as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know that you were supportive of that. And so, councilman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Mayor, I'm absolutely I've committed this to two former council members. I've had this conversation with former council members. We just had a brief conversation with the Library Foundation. I think there's plenty of opportunities to to highlight our local leaders, and I think we should do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've heard names. I remember Bill Baker was around when I first started working for the city, and I had tremendous respect for him. And I know Dr. Marks, but Judge Tucker is, you know, comes up in and there are a lot of I think it would be really interesting and looking at how we can highlight other women'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in Long Beach and around our grounds of our library, other establishments, and we have a main library coming up. So I really think that this is an interesting catalyst moment for us to really kind of look holistically about how we how we make sure everyone has some attention and we and we think strategically about how we also'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Well, thank you. And I want to thank all of you for for coming out and for supporting something, especially the young folks, for making what I think is really a great suggestion. And so thank you, guys for for doing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, I want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To finally just say I just want to say thank you to everyone who who took the time to come out both sides of the issue. You guys were very passionate. I heard a few things. People said, oh, I was moved by the comment or I may not have known very much about the first lady, but this is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the community process. This is the beginning. And I'm hoping that we have a strong community as a result as a result of this. So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And with that, there is a motion and a second. And again, the motion is for the council to consider the new North Branch Library as the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library and request library services and Department of Parks to conduct outreach and engage youth and library patrons around the naming of the library and move'",

I'm sure most of you won't stay, which is okay. So just if I could just ask you as you exit, just to, you know, be as quiet as possible so we can continue'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the meeting. Thank you very much. If I can just do the consent calendar real quick. Okay. There's a motion and a second. Is there any public comment on consent? KC Nunn members, please cast your votes.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm turning it over to staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council. Infrastructure is one of the most important things that a city does. In addition to providing public safety and our services, it is one of the chief core missions of a city is to provide streets and roads and facilities and and all the things that go into infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From time to time, we get questions from the council in the community about what are our infrastructure needs. We wanted to present a presentation to you today to give you a, you know, an estimate of what those needs are over the next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I will turn it now over to our deputy director of Public Works, our city engineer, Sean Crumby, who's going to go through a brief PowerPoint presentation to talk at a high level about what our needs are over the next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, Honorable Mayor and Council. As mentioned, the presentation for the study session tonight focuses on city infrastructure needs. This study session continues a series of presentations this year by the Public Works Department. In March of this year.'",
        "'speaker_11': '2015, the City Council was presented with the state of our streets and in October this year with an update to the city's parking assets. Tonight's presentation reflects the collaboration of the Public Works Department with other departments of the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the presentation is going to begin and highlight what's being done with current resources, followed by a transition to unfunded needs and conclude with funding shortfalls. Over in the city. So to begin, Strong Foundation, Strong City, that's the motto of the public works department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think it's important in regards to to relay the strength of infrastructure within the city or the importance of infrastructure within the city. The definition of that infrastructure can vary along beaches. Infrastructure extends beyond the roads, bridges and sidewalks of the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Other infrastructure components include public safety facilities, storm drains and pump stations, community centers and parks that bring together people of all ages. Our energy, infrastructure and new technologies such as fiber optics, all of these components are related. Improving the infrastructure enhances the quality of life for all residents and continues to make Long Beach a national leader in'",
        "'speaker_11': 'livability. In this past fiscal year, Long Beach has continued an aggressive infrastructure program that brought over 50 park projects through completion, responded over 2200 facility repairs, rehabilitated 55 lane miles of arterial streets and 16 lane miles of residential streets throughout the city repaired five major bridges and enhanced a variety of bike bicycle infrastructure throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Within the capital improvement program. The City Council adopted fiscal year 2016 capital improvements this September. This budget includes 50.6 million in spending on new projects. Just a summary of a few key projects not intended to be comprehensive are shown within this slide.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As approved by the City Council last week. Work will begin on the Civic Center, which includes City Hall Headquarters, the main library and Lincoln Park. Installation began on 25,000 LED street lights citywide. The East Police to the East Division Police to Station Project will be completed near the start of 2016.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Project continues. Progress continues on construction of the Northshore, which are the North Branch Library. Work also is in progress to force wetlands, gum binder park as well, as well as critical road work on Ocean Boulevard and Alameda Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With street projects, bicycle infrastructure is added, most notably will be the Pacific Bike Boulevard and Sixth Street projects under progress this year. So infrastructure needs. It's clear that despite the immense progress that's made, there remains a lot more to do, much more to do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Long Beach is at a critical juncture with aging infrastructure and facilities. The slides remaining from here will highlight the major investments needed in our city infrastructure. So taking into consideration all of the infrastructure needs, the total infrastructure cost over the next ten years is $2.8 billion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The rest of the presentation is going to focus on what comprises that $2.8 billion. But in addition to that, we're going to cover infrastructure. We're going to cover maintenance needs that total $40 million per year. So transportation infrastructure, the first component to be covered.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These include components that move people throughout the city, but also is a key component to facilitation of goods, movement and economic development. This infrastructure includes not only what's visible above the roadway surface, but also a network below the surface, including our cities stormwater system.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So first is our street inventory. This slide was taken directly from the city's payment management program. The city of Long Beach has about 177 miles of major roadways, plus an additional 600 miles, 609 miles of local roadways, encompassing 169 million square feet of asphalt and concrete surfacing throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Even though major roadway networks, even though that comprise less than one quarter of the total network by length, it actually represents 35% of the paved area on a per mile basis. An average major roadway cost approximately $2.3 million to construct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Whereas. A local network as a local network. Whereas the local network represents 65% of the pavement paved area, with an average replacement cost of just under $1,000,000 per mile. So this slide depicts some pictures of different pavement condition index conditions throughout the city label.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are the values 100 would be a brand new street. Zero would be a failed street. In all cases, all of these streets are in need of repair. So this slide provides the average estimated peak PCI for road conditions for the next ten years based on three funding scenarios.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our city's entire road network of streets, both major and minor roadways, is currently at a pavement condition index of 60. As adopted by the City Council, major roadways are currently funded at 11.4 million and minor roadways at 4.9 million this fiscal year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's the $16.3 million that's shown. However, to bring the backlog to 20%. At maximum would require a 14.3 million and 16.6 million. For major and minor roadways, respectively. That's the 30.9 million that's shown. The optimal solution, however, which eliminates all the backlog and brings the city's network to an average pavement condition index of 85 would require 17'",
        "'speaker_11': 'million annually for the major roadways and 25 million for minor roadways. That's 42 million. In sum, the optimal solution would require 420 million over ten years, which is 257 million more than what is currently budgeted. If we continue to fund at the 6.3 million current annual level.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'According to experts in payment management, backlogs that exceed 20% and above tend to become unmanageable. The cost of repair and maintenance of streets increases as this condition becomes worse and the PCI drops without adequate funding to reduce that backlog.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The needs increase every year. Other components of transportation needs totaled 933.4 million. Alleys are estimated at 60 million in repair work. There's currently no funded ALI program within our capital improvement program, but there have been recent, numerous discussions about funding needs, bridges, connect to city streets and have needs totaling 365 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'With the Shoemaker Bridge estimated at 250 million of that total stormwater includes 147 million for rehabilitation of 24 pumps and 108 million estimated for the Long Beach Mosque project. Sidewalks, bicycle infrastructure and parking structures have received improvements but have needs totaling over $70 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Shown her pictures of typical infrastructure needs. The photos show the condition of our sidewalks and unpaved alleyway. Unpaved alleys in the upper right. Our bike boulevard. And what happens when a pump station fails? Community. Community infrastructure and non transportation related infrastructure that the public relies on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Spanning public safety, library services, parks, health facilities and the coastline technology and other city services. The city owns 414 buildings totaling 6.8 million square feet. The facility condition index or rating for city buildings assessments have poor condition. These buildings do not receive the maintenance or have not received the maintenance necessary to extend their or maximize their useful'",
        "'speaker_11': 'life. Adequate maintenance extends or maximizes the use of all of these buildings. So we'll start with public safety. The unfunded needs for public safety totals more than $130 million. Fire replacement. Replacement fire stations. Seven, nine, ten, 11, 18 and 19.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These fire stations range in age from 48 to 79 years. Improvements are needed to address workplace safety, public accessibility and workforce privacy issues, including separate gender restrooms and locker. And locker rooms. Police wear and tear at the police academy range and facility are needed to support and train officers to meet current public safety standards.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Many of the Academy's facilities are located in trailers put in place in 1998 and were never intended to last the past 17 years. Classrooms, locker rooms and staff offices at the Academy are located in these trailers. Recruit replacement of the academy with a new permanent facility is estimated at $20 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A new crime lab and property facility is needed to meet the 21st Century Police Department. This is estimated at $15 million. The remaining balance is for needs that other facilities, such as the jailhouse and substations. The Echo see.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Emergency Communications and Operations Center needs power supply, stability and backup power. Before you. Some pictures related to the police academy, which is still in temporary trailers. Fire Station ten is in need of replacement after nearly 50 years of service.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It shows daily wear and tear, typical for a 24 hour facility of that age. Parks and Recreation. 365 million needs have been identified across 162 parks, 26 community centers, historic sites and other facilities. The above are only a sampling of those projects.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The projects include new developments to the park systems, but many of the projects reflect age parks with the toll of deferred maintenance. One example of a large park is Halton Park. That's a 95 year old park that is one of the highest, if not the highest, utilized in the city and in need of and have needs that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'need to be addressed. The most significant item, however, includes the need to obtain update irrigation systems citywide, which account for almost a third of the projected total. In addition, roof replacements across the city account for another 21 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These photos show conditions to conditions of parks across the city. A Community centers are in need of repair. Playgrounds have failing equipment. Roofs need replacements. Restrooms are dilapidated, and irrigation system systems need improvements. Coastal infrastructure for coastal areas.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Parks, Recreation and Marine have identified 12.7 million in unfunded projects, largely largely driven by the need for Alamitos Bay Channel dredging, as well as improvements and general maintenance of facilities. In addition to the improvements at the marinas, beaches and waterways in June of this year, the City Council approved an update to the five year Tidelands capital priority'",
        "'speaker_11': 'needs. That's reflected that reflects the realities of declining oil revenues. This list is in order of highest costs, not necessarily and is not intended to be a priority for the project for the projected needs. Shown in the picture is the Junior Lifeguard headquarters, which serves hundreds of junior lifeguards and does not meet today's needs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'An additional 14 million of projects has been identified for LED conversions. Currently, a $6.7 million project is funded to convert street streetlights throughout the city. The 14 million in additional needs includes conversion to existing outdoor lighting at parks as well as other post lightings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Other city facilities, unfunded needs at various other facilities total just under $70,000,000.60 8.8. The public works yard includes consolidation of its three facilities, the library services various maintenance needs across the whole library system health has. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning flooring needs for a new mobile health clinic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Fleet Services has needs to repair the fleet service facility, where 1.4 million in facility maintenance is needed at the Temple, Temple and Willow Complex. Structural maintenance, such as window replacement, floor resurfacing and traffic striping, and the need for a camera system amount to almost 75% of that total estimate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Here's some photos demonstrative of the capital needs of the Health Department's facilities, with pavement damage, wall and floor cracks and other capital needs. Further needs are shown at the Fleet Services Library Services in Long Beach, gas and oil.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Technology and innovation have needs totaling just over $70 million. The city is in need of updating its handheld radios for public safety, which amount to $40 million of that total. Additionally, radio system backbone as well as other radio infrastructure adds 13 million.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Needs also include fiber optic connections throughout the city for future development and support initiatives taken by the Bloomberg I-Team. Maintenance matters. Maintenance is a critical component to effectively manage infrastructure and protect the investments that are made by the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So while this presentation has primarily focused on one time capital needs throughout the city. Maintenance of existing and new facilities needs to be considered. While the Public Works Facilities Management Division has an operating budget of 4.4 million annually in the adopted 2016 budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Facility Condition Index report noted an annual need of 15 to $20 million to the upkeep of over the 100 facilities within the city. Additionally, Parks Rec and Marine have identified annual minutes cost needs of 20 million for basic repairs, upkeep of current and new facilities combined.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's a total need of $40 million annually. So in summary, taking into consideration all the projects that have been identified, the total infrastructure cost is 2.8 billion over the next ten years. This reflects projects identified throughout tonight's presentation, inclusive of the $40 million in maintenance needs that were discussed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. A couple of things. So the first is I just want to make sure I know that we were initially going to present this last week and a couple of members aren't here. So I want to make sure, Mr. Modica, that in kind of your next round of briefings in the next week, that you kind of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are able to present all this information because it's important information to the rest of the council members.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Mr. Mayor, we can certainly do that and we will make this public. This will be available, this presentation for the public as well. I wanted to let you start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And then and then the other piece I want to just to mention is there is can you expand on the issue? And the one the one that's concerned me for a while is the issue about for every dollar that we're not investing, the cost dramatically increases over time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't know if what staff want to comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. Great question. So as the condition of the city's infrastructure declines, the repair costs increase. So as they're ignored, those repair costs go up and it costs more to bring them back to the condition the longer we wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I have a motion in a second for to receive and part of the report. Let me go and do public comment. Is there any public comment on this item? Just come forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good in council. Mayor Garcia, Tom Stout information is on file. You know, you guys just voted to add dates for a half a billion dollars last week. And you have all these infrastructure needs a total, almost that amount that's deferred.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You guys have been deferring maintenance ever since I moved along Beach in 1986. The street at my house in Chestnut, the 3100 block has never been repaid since I moved here in 86. It's funny that Mr. Ranga Street was paved many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It wasn't any worse condition than mine. Yet there seemed to be some favoritism there. You paved from Pacific. I guess from Willow to 31st Street, from Pacific to the river. But why did you stop at 31st? There, there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The streets south of us were no worse condition than the streets where I live. I mean, drive on it. It sounds like a hardwood floor that the glues no longer sticking. All you hear is a cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck when you drive over it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you pictured some of those streets. We're never going to get anything done because 90% of the general fund is compensation. You spend ten or 12, I mean, maybe 15 million a year on paving the road, yet you spend a hundred million on your own pensions, and that's going to continue to increase, you say, by about 3'",
        "'speaker_9': 'million a year. So in 2021, when Per says you all this money? It's going to be, you say, 135. A lot of other people say $150 million. That means that all the stuff that you keep spending money on is not going to provide us any more services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hers is a, you know, saying it's the elephant in the room as a gross understatement. You guys talk about the great pension reform you had. That's a parks pensions will be $150 million by 2021. And now $150 million will go forward for the next 15 or 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where are we going to get some extra money to make the repairs in this city that we need? When compensation takes everything and pensions will grow up more because there will be raises raises add to their pensions. So, you know, I don't think that, you know, nothing's got better.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And since I moved here, it's got more expensive. Property value goes up. Property value goes down. Property value goes down because infrastructure is hurt. And it's always going to be a low priority in the city. You have a lot of nice slides, but nothing ever gets repaired.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir. Thank you. Any other public comment? CASEY None. And actually, I just was just informed that we missed two slides at the end. I'm sorry, Mr. Modica. So I think if you want to just quickly put those up zero.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if you could bring those up real quickly, I'll cover those. So what we wanted to point out on Slide 30 is that we do dedicate a fair amount of resources towards our infrastructure. We have about $31.1 million worth of our own city funds that we spend on infrastructure maintenance citywide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's not all. General Fund, a lot of that is, you know, in the various departments. But we also do very well at bringing in federal, state and regional funds. So these are MTA funds. These are state for state transportation funds and federal grants for infrastructure as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's about 24 million. And then we also go out and look for new grants that are specific for for infrastructure, for example, to force wetlands received almost all of its funding from state grants of 12.5 million. So that's about $67.6 million that we brought in in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, on the next slide, as you can see, if you take that $2.8 million billion dollars and assume that if we were to fund all that need over ten years, essentially, even with that $67 million, our annual shortfall would be about $212 million per year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So while we are doing very well at securing funds there, there is a tremendous need. And what we have currently doesn't cover what what our need is over the next ten years. And with that, we're available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'm going to go first to the make or the motion, then I have a series of councilmembers. So, Councilmember Austin.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And I want to thank the staff for this very chilling report. $2.8 billion over ten years is is it's not making our job as a city council any easier, that's for certain. And the decisions that we make.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The needs are clearly vast and untenable with our current level of funding and our current finances. I get as a council member and I'm sure many of my colleagues do as well, request we leave from residents to to pay attention to the the neglected infrastructure in the streets, alleys, sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know we all do the best we can with the resources that we do have. The limited resources that were was just just outlined for you. And I think we do do a great job of patchwork and addressing most critical needs in our districts with the with the limited resources that we have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But. And then when it when we have inclement weather, when we have rain, where we're reminded most of it, I mean, I think I received a few text messages or people sent me pictures of puddles in front of their their homes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it is very, very difficult to to tell people, hey, you know what, I wish we had the resources to to pave your alley or to order to fix your street, your curb and gutter. And so we are going to, as Mr. Stout said, have to make infrastructure truly a priority.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're going to have to do it when? Now. Have to step up and potentially. Make us make some tough decisions. I did did have a couple of questions in regards to this. I mean, I understand we have a number of you laid out basically everything, but some of these areas are don't they receive uplands funds some of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the more coastal area of the highlands once.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So some of the coastal needs are covered by tidelands funds. So we did show those though not everything is required under on that list would be paid for by general funds that could be paid for by other funding sources such as Tidelands.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they're not not of $2.8 billion is necessarily. Um, there's, there's a whole there, there may be some funding coming in other sources to, to, to meet those needs. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct. When we looked at this analysis, we didn't focus just on generally funded. We focused generally on our infrastructure and our technology needs citywide. And then, you know, the various funding sources could fund certain pieces of that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this was a big picture kind of overview.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. And I should point out that these are rough estimates that not every single project that the city has is included in there. Some have very strong engineering assessments. Some are very rough estimates. It was more of a a picture to the council of of a general outline of our infrastructure needs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I think it was it was it was necessary. I don't think I've ever seen anything this comprehensive. Um, and like I said, it was, it was chilling for us to see that, that type of number. I do think that I do have some, some, some hope because I think the payment management plan that we have in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'place will help us prioritize street repairs. And and we have a system in place that that will will help us move move that program. But I think, obviously, where we're short on on on finances and revenue, I'm concerned that without identifying new sources of revenue, the city will not be able to address this $2.8 billion of long'",
        "'speaker_9': 'term infrastructure needs identified tonight without cutting critical services. And as the speaker mentioned, yes, we do have employees. Employees cost. It is the cost of running a government. It's the cost of running a city to try to to be able to deliver the services and to maintenance and and do all of the great things that that the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city of Long Beach does. You know, our residents live here for a reason because they enjoy the city. So that said, I'd like to request that the city manager and finance staff work with the city attorney and city clerk to provide options for new sources of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, let's let's put it out there. We we've got an overview. We have a understanding of what our infrastructure needs are. Let's let's let's show us how to get there, how do we fix it? And I think this council may need to consider options for identifying sources of revenue to make needed investments in infrastructure and other'",
        "'speaker_9': 'important city services. And so what I'm asking for staff is can you guys come back in the next few weeks in an early part of next year with some information to help guide this council on a decision in that regard?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that's something the council would like. We can certainly provide that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I'm sorry. The second the motion with Councilwoman Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank you. I want to think staff a staff Shawn and say Ron and everyone that was a part of this for taking this over. I know with Reagan this has been a large undertaking, but it's a really great large picture, as we've been talking about, as to what our city needs in terms of infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I will certainly be and always have been an advocate for better infrastructure. You know, as we put forth the alley plan or the alley agenda item a few weeks ago, you know, of course, we're very committed. I also like what Councilmember Austin mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think, of course, we certainly do need dollars to be able to make all of this happen. But looking specifically at leveraging dollars, you know, sitting on both the state and federal legislative committee, for instance, we've done great work with Shoemaker Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know in going to DC and really talking to the Department of Transportation or talking to our Congressmember Alan Lowenthal, about specific funds that we may need. So this is a beautiful document for us to go and take when we're at these different committee meetings to really give them a picture of what Long Beach will look like'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So I just ask that maybe we look at, you know, for instance, Prop 84 funds that were used for Craftsman Village Park. I know, just kind of documenting a little bit more detail as to what other funds could be used in leveraging these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then I think I did hear, but I just want to make sure the document will be added online as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, perfect. Great. Well, thank you very much and great work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council Member Richardson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor Garcia, and thank you to staff for that presentation. I appreciate the comprehensive nature. I am also deeply concerned about our inability to invest in our infrastructure. We can only go so far with respect to taking a triage approach on how we handle our our critical infrastructure needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that there are tremendous needs across the city. And I was glad to see that there was really sort of reflected in this report, like our counterpart community center, 95 year old community center. I know about this center, but I know that there are needs and stories just like this across across across town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I know that our residents don't want a second rate city, and I know that we all want to be proud of our neighborhoods. And we also want to, to some degree, control our fate and not always, you know, wait on grant funding to handle the important things that are that are vital to our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think this is certainly appropriate, and I'm going to be in support of Councilman Austin's recommendation as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have very little info.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, would like to thank staff for putting this thorough presentation together. I know a lot of work went into the research and really review of our entire city. We have talked for quite a long time about investing in our city and our city's infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There have been councilmembers here before. Many of us joined this team that have expressed how difficult it is to really catch up, let alone stay ahead of our infrastructure repair and restoration needs. And so the beauty of our city being as old as it is, also comes with these challenges.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think investing in the infrastructure will ensure that all of the progress that this city is making is supported. Failing infrastructure is difficult. We have in many areas just really considered ourselves in the position to do spot treatment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think taking a wholesale approach, really a whole wholesome approach to shoring it up is very important. And in the past, certainly in the retreat that we had last year, I want to say it's about a year ago we discussed our priority being infrastructure repair and restoration and all of the technological innovations that we pursue and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are really advancing in, especially with the new innovation team that's been supported by the Bloomberg grant. All of that will be for not if we have crumbling infrastructure. And so, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your commitment to looking ahead for how this city can be secure really well beyond any one of our ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that's that's really one of the key roles we have here is to ensure that the city is shored up and can be stabilized long after that has a lasting effect long after our tenure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ringo.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mary. And I want to thank you all for obviously putting this forward. It's been a long time since we had any kind of study of this nature to look at our infrastructure and how we can we can fund it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I know I asked earlier when I was meeting with the city manager, you know, how are we doing on oil? Because some of these projects are oil, talent and other resources. And apparently there's no change in the fact it's going further, further down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So revenue is going to be a big challenge. So I'm going to support Councilmember Austin's motion to look at this even further. We don't have full council tonight. So, I mean, we're not going to have that robust discussion as we probably could have or should have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm looking forward to bringing this back again in the next few weeks so we can get a full, full extent as to what what's out there and what types of action could take. And I wouldn't especially thank Council Member Gonzales for bringing up the alleys.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And alleys is a big thing in my district and certainly having that included in this study is is important because a lot of neighborhoods are suffering in regards to what their alleys look like and the access that our city employees are refuse collectors have in terms of being able to pick up the revenues from from the alleys'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And of course, there's the the issues of our public safety buildings and our parks recreation building. So I'm looking forward to the next report that we get the update and moving forward with this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I want to just start by thanking staff. I know you guys actually work really hard on this and working on this for a while. And and I just want to thank the entire public works, Parks and Recreation and the city management team.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know technology, innovation, Health Department, everyone was involved in some way in this project. I know Public Works took the lead and I just want to thank you because I know it's very extensive and certainly there's an enormous amount of need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so thank you for that. And I also just just wanted a couple just kudos. I think I do want to thank you know, Councilman Austin has been on this issue particular when it comes to the statewide advocacy piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to just remind us that we still also have an opportunity to hopefully also work with the legislature in this next upcoming cycle as they look at ways of trying to get cities transportation dollars. And we're in a situation today, unfortunately, where the state and Congress have chosen to do very little to help our transportation'",
        "'speaker_0': 'road repair, street repair needs. And so we will continue, I know, through the state led committee in particular, but also just to a further extent to to a lesser extent. But we will still do some work in the federal committee on trying to get some sort of package down to our cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obviously, there's no guarantee that's going to happen, but I know that work will continue. And I want to thank Councilman Austin and Councilman Richardson for I know that the work that's happening on the on the committees and to staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is great stuff. You'll get this report online. You'll get the information back to the to the full council. And I know put that information on line as well so that it's all out there. And and that's it.'",
