        "'speaker_2': 'This is a great example of the city making investments to support the establishment of the very resources we know people want and need. The most high quality preschool has been proven to be the deepest impact on children and children's leaders success and stability in life.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But it's really gratifying to me that the city pressed hard to make sure we had preschool classrooms here. We have a shortage of preschool classrooms in North Seattle.

And he was right. It was involvement of the community in in the process of of making this final decision that really, really made a'",
