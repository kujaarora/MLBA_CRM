        "'speaker_7': 'The report, the full council agenda item number one clerk file 314278. Petition of ACORN Development LLC for the vacation of the Alien BLOCK 21 Sarah Abel Second Edition to the City of Seattle, bounded by Bell Street, Seventh Avenue, Blanchard Street and Eighth Avenue, held December 14th, 2015.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Burgess.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Gonzales. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. So this is this is related to the revocation of block 21. The Transportation Committee recommended approval of the vacation of the alley in block 21. So I think the way that the order goes is that we will consider first the amendment that is being made to the Transportation Committee's recommendation for approval of the allocation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That amendment is being made by myself, Council member Burgess and Councilmember Herbold, and then secondarily will take up the recommendation of the Transportation Committee as amended if the amendment passes. I think I'm accurate on that in terms of process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So by way of background, the full council took up this particular the Transportation Committee recommendation at its hearing on December 14th, 2015. At that time, council members Liccardo O'Brien, Sawant and myself raised concerns about the need for a condition as part of the Clark file that would serve to protect free speech activities should the vacation be granted'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And as a result of that, the full council voted to hold over this particular item to today's hearing of the full council, and it is before us at this particular point in time. Now, over the past several weeks, I've worked with Councilmember Burgess and subsequently with Councilmember Herbold to draft some language that that would address those free'",
        "'speaker_5': 'speech concerns that were brought up in our full council, our last full council hearing before we went to recess. And I believe that this amendment addresses those concerns as related to the free speech of members of the public who seek to access that public, private property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I, I want to say thank you to all of the advocates, both from SEIU Local six and from Transit Riders Union and others who have come and talked to city council members in the intervening weeks and who have come today to provide testimony on their concerns around Amazon's practices and want to want to at least iterate'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on my part that I, as a labor lawyer, as somebody who worked ten years on protecting and championing and advocating on behalf of only workers against corporate interests, I hear your concerns and I hope that we can move forward on this city council to address those concerns in a forum where we have the latitude to be able'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to really take on those particular issues. So the amendment before us is in everybody's packets. And the amendment includes just by way of background, it includes a few different changes. It will include a paragraph in what's known to be the property, sort of let me get this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The the PDA, which is a property use and development agreement, will include a condition in this allocation. Should it be granted that the areas that are open and accessible to the public must be open and accessible for 24 hours a day, with temporary closures permitted only for reasons such as maintenance, safety or private functions, free speech activities'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that will be fully protected with this particular amendment. If approved, free speech activities include things like handling, signature gathering, holding signs, all without obstructing access to the space, the building or other adjacent amenity features, and without unreasonably interfering with the enjoyment of the space by others shall be allowed within these public benefit features while engaged and allowed'",
        "'speaker_5': 'activities. Members of the public may not be asked to leave for any reason other than conduct that unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the space by others. That is the actual language that will be imposed as part of a condition of the PDA if this amendment passes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Another aspect of this is that it creates both a signage requirement and which which would have to be not only reviewed, but approved by Ascot Street vacations. That sign will advise people who are making use of the property knowledge with their rights around free speech activities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The last piece of this is that there is now included a a provision that will allow the city to seek enforcement against Amazon. If if those free if there is a claim that the free speech condition has been violated, then there will be a mechanism to create to do enforcement and make sure that folks rights are being'",
        "'speaker_5': 'upheld in that regard. So that is by way of briefing the amendments that are being proposed by myself, Councilmember Burgess and Councilmember Herbold. And I'll hand it off to my co-sponsors to add remarks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd Second Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, it's been moved and second to amend council bill. The clerk filed 314278. Are there any further comments on the amendment? If not, we do. Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I just want to thank Councilmembers Gonzales and Burgess for including the my two requests, one being the addition of the hours of open access, and secondly, the enforcement the enforcement mechanisms already in the language. But you flipped it so we could also make sure that the signage is provided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been active in developing the city's POPS program. Privately owned public spaces, and providing signage for these spaces is really, really important if you want to see.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good active use of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for those comments. Are there any other comments on the amendments? If not?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's early in the year. Council President Harrell. Should we be standing or sitting when we're making comments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the rules changed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Standing is optional. No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's look. We look that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through. We slip that through. I think people should stand. But I did support the change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that some standing is kind of like the exclamation point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's right. Yeah. You do it with emphasis here, so don't overdo it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. So I want to thank the the folks that worked up this amendment. As folks know, this was a point of contention at full council at the last meeting of 2015, excuse me. And one of the reasons why I wasn't ready to support it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think the this language addresses a lot of the concerns around First Amendment rights. My preference has been to refer this back to committee because I don't think there was just full discussion in committee. But that said, I will support this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to I want to just re-emphasize that I have experienced security guards approaching me when when I had a sign on Amazon Plaza, and I'd spoken to that a few times before. Also, over the holiday break, I was forwarded a Twitter post by a local news reporter who was approached by an Amazon security guard, which she'",
        "'speaker_8': 'speculated was an Amazon security guard asking her to leave or if she had permission to be there. And so I think it's really important that Amazon commits to making sure that security officers are properly trained when regards to respect the rights the public has on these spaces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I look forward to having that dialog with Amazon as we move forward to respect the rights of of Seattle's residents and workers. I have some other comments I'll make on the underlying bill after this amendment moves forward, but I will support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Are there any other comments on the amendment hearing then? The clerk filed 314278 has been moved. And second, in terms of the amendment. All those in favor say I. I oppose. The ayes have it. Would you like additional comments on the underlying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Clifton. I have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I want to say special thanks to those in the neighborhood in District seven from Belltown and the Bell Street Corridor, that what this particular space will do is to help us connect what we're now calling Moai to market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it will be a pedestrian corridor for people to be able to walk in. An expanded lovely green space at this particular parcel will be part of it. But I want to say thank you to those that were involved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is 30,000 square feet of public open space and it had the enthusiastic and unanimous support of our Downtown Design Review Board. And I support this as well as being your District seven council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. If there are no Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just wanted to also express my support for the underlying legislation today. As the public may know, there are two options set in front of this body right now in terms of the what Amazon has filed with the city for its master use permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The approval of the allocation, I think is the best possible built environment choice for our residents. Not only does it offer a better pedestrian environment, but also contributes financially to that pedestrian environment, as well as generating over $8 million towards affordable housing here in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to say thank you to my colleagues who offered an amendment around the privately owned public spaces. I, too, have been booted out of a privately owned public space just for being on the phone because I didn't have a badge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need to make sure that we're doing what we can to make sure that these are, I think, appropriate leave monitored and that the security folks are really well trained on what can and is allowed in a privately owned public space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's really important for us to understand the public benefits associated with vacations. We don't currently have the authority, as I understand it, to enter into the sorts of benefits that have been put forward by some organizations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I hope that we can go back as a committee and as a council and take a look at some of the opportunities moving forward over the next couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Johnson, are there any other comments any my colleagues would like to make on the amendment? Clark filed 314278. Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you and thank you, Councilmember Johnson, for that segway into what I'm about to say, because I do want to take a minute to just step back and both acknowledge that from an urban design perspective, a lot of great work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Obviously, a unanimous decision by the Design Commission speaks highly of the design elements. We heard a few folks comment today from the broader community about the design elements that they like. And I would agree that those design elements are very strong for this project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the issue of, you know, how the public has some say in what private design happens is somewhat limited. And when we are selling public right of way is one of the opportunities, we have to have some influence over how that moves forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I want to just be explicit with the public and future applicants that this council takes that role very seriously. And I think that it's a we're at a point now where the guidelines and standards that we've been following historically, well, they may have been appropriate in the past.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's time for us to revisit those and see what's appropriate going forward. Today is a very different world than it was 20 years ago or even five years ago, and that work has started during the budget process. Last year the Council asked our staff to do to gather data on on street vacations and early vacations over the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'last 20 years. And we expect to hear back from Massdot sometime in the next couple of months to see what are the types of public benefits we've received in the past and then also have the conversation about what are the types of public benefits we think the public is looking for going forward within the legal constraints that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we have to operate in. I also want to just take a second to talk about an ongoing labor dispute that's happening at Amazon and how disappointed I am that a company like Amazon that has created so much wealth for some folks in the community is also contributing to a race to a race to the bottom for its'",
        "'speaker_8': 'contracted security workers. Specifically, I'm going to call out the Amazon subcontractors, security, industrial specialists. Some folks during public comment highlighted them. This is the kind of company that the way they're behaving now should have no place in Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'SARS has at least 15 individual complaints filed against them for numerous violations of Seattle's paid sick leave and safe time. Law workers have been suspended and even fired for taking sick leave. When the Seattle Office for Civil Rights, the Seattle Office for Civil Rights has reached a settlement agreement with SIAC for these violations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But my understanding is SARS has still not complied with all the terms of those settlements. SARS has also had numerous federal labor law complaints against them, for which they recently settled with the National Labor Relations Board. It's the type of company that for actually frankly, for for a company like Amazon that is such a high profile and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'such a successful business in our community. And someone that I think all of us want to be pointing to is the example of what Seattle businesses do. I think Amazon can do better when they hold their subcontractors accountable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And frankly, it's been appalling to me that they've continued to absolve themselves the responsibility and say that this is merely on SARS. Folks have said that Amazon, while driving incredible growth and wealth in Seattle, has also been playing an instrumental role well and has played an integral role in Lifting City out of the Great Recession.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It has also pointed to as a symbol that has caused displacement and drive. Not the cost of housing and forcing and growing income inequality we face. There's an opportunity here, I think, to demonstrate how a city that's becoming a city of tech workers can also be one that supports those that serve them their coffee and manage their'",
        "'speaker_8': 'office buildings. That's why I think it's more important than ever that we carefully think about the future of public benefits that are provided for street and alley vacations and for any deal that results in public property or ride away becoming privatized.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to just I see some Amazon folks, some representatives in the room to commit to you that I won't be part of the conversations going forward. I, I believe that our interests are actually aligned here. And I hope that we can continue to work towards solutions that meet all of our needs and take steps for Amazon'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to really demonstrate to our community that they are going to be a high road employer for all workers and not just the Walmart in the sky. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Bryan, councilmember suarez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is deborah ward and I represent district five.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'First of all, I want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To thank council member Herbert Burgess and Gonzales for the amendments that they made and the good work that they did in addressing the First Amendment issues. I am new, but I did have an opportunity to go back and look at the public benefits and what we look at when we make a determination about street vacations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's important to keep in mind that the city acts as a trustee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the public in the public good.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that the public benefit we receive should outweigh the benefit that the petitioner receives. I'm not pointing to any particular company right now, and I want to thank the people that have spoken to Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Salant and O'Bryant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we need to go back and look at 2009. And what we laid out is what the issues about what a public benefit is and what it brings to a community and the world is a lot different now in 2006 than it was in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we need to revisit that. Certainly business does time or does business in real time, and I think the government should do business in real time. And I look forward to working with the community, the business community, and certainly with my fellow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council members on public public.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Benefits and what they mean to our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember where's Councilmember Sawant?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, President Harrell. I, I have talked to guns to members. My staff have talked to a gun to members. And one of the points that has been made. Frequently is that, well, if we want to change the public benefit process, then we should change it and then apply the law, not hold Amazon accountable to a law'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that isn't in place at this moment, as if, you know, somehow this is going to be grossly unfair to Amazon. I wanted to say that it's not totally I mean, that there is some truth to that, but it is not totally accurate to say that Amazon has dutifully gone through the whole process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as Governor O'Brien explained, you know, there were there's a there's a very clear rationale for taking this back to committee. Part of the process that every petitioner has to go through is for the council, this body, elected body, to vote on such an allegation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is part of the process. But as I see it, this is not a rubber stamping. It shouldn't be. At least that's what I think. This is the only this part of the process where the council comes into action is the only accountability, democratic accountability that working people can have over big business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members can talk about changing the process, but the reality is that that that is only meaningful if elected officials are willing to vote against such an early vacation for the moment or send it back to committee. As Councilmember O'Brien said, that was our preference, and I would still prefer that even if the request is coming from'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a powerful business. I don't think it will be sufficient. Even as far as the free speech is concerned, free speech concerns are are, you know, are the topic. I supported the amendment and just do things. Thank former council member Lekota, who brought forward the former incarnation of that amendment that we just passed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think I support that, but I don't think it will be sufficient to address the concerns of free speech and also concerns of workers. Amazon has outsourced a security guard to a company and has gone tomorrow and said to security industry specialists or ISIS to try and avoid them by letting them have their democratic right to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a union. It makes it easier to oppress workers in this way if you contract it out so you can just wash your hands of it. But we know SARS has shamelessly flouted Seattle's basic labor law. They did not give safe and sick leave.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have engaged in routine intimidation and even firings when one woman worker demanded her rights. As I has responded by publishing her children's medical records online, that's an example of intimidation. And Amazon is willfully turning a blind eye to this problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have refused to respond to these concerns, and I know that they have refused to respond because I was with workers at a demonstration when they had a letter to present to Jeff Bezos. He refused to meet with us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think they didn't know that they are the workers at a councilmember with them. And they made us all go on the street in the rain, even leaving their foyer, public foyer. Many elected officials think one can represent both the needs of workers and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Big business, but you cannot. This is a live example of where you have to pick a side and consumers are choosing to pick a side one way or another. And it's. Disingenuous to pretend that this is all just fair and square.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a society that has a significant wealth and power differentials, so it is not neutral. This process is not neutral. It's not supposed to be neutral. And I know elected officials have said and will continue to say a lot about workers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But let's be clear, unless we use our position on issues like this one on bills like this one to hold big business accountable, then it is just words. At the end of the day, I'm sorry. Then they're just words.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And because Amazon.com didn't want to be bothered with a delay until members, many of whom have accepted corporate donations and have a long track record of standing up for corporations against workers interests, I have indicated a willingness to give Amazon a smooth passage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have no divided loyalties. I support workers. And if council members are not willing to send this back to the Transportation Committee to be properly discussed, and I do intend to vote no on this allegation. But my first choice would have been to send us back to committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I wanted to thank Councilmember O'Brien for politically leading that that part up last year. And that would have been a good opportunity for the council to do its job, to provide the space, to discuss with the community, the workers and Amazon, and find a real solution to the concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then Amazon could have had its Ali vacation, but in a way that protects the public. However, council members have made it clear that they will not support that. So I cannot support this allegation that does not protect the interests of regular workers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember, so much. So we have in front of us Councilmember Herbold, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. One point to remind folks, if you don't remember in 2014, this council actually wrote a letter to Jeff Bezos. And to my to my knowledge, we haven't received a response. And it is it was a letter designed to deal with just these issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did speak to two Amazon representatives last week. They informed me that they had performed an audit of Cece's employment practices. And I at that point asked whether or not we could see or have a review of that audit so we could judge for ourselves the compliance with the city's labor laws.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that's the appropriate place to have this conversation is within the context of our enforcement mechanisms. We have just the the previous years council passed legislation to explicitly give the Office of Civil Rights, the Division of the Labor Standards Office, the ability to do proactive enforcement of our labor laws.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we need to work really closely with that office in identifying industries and particular employers where we have seen a history of problems. And I would really be interested in bringing that conversation on how to roll out that proactive element of this office.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To my knowledge, are the Office of Labor Standards is not doing proactive enforcement at this point. And I think we need to talk about how to roll that out, how to engage with the community and identifying industries and particular employers that we want to see that proactive enforcement for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for those comments, Councilmember Herbold. Okay. So we have an amended or a condition court file 314278. Are there any other comments that any of my colleagues would like to make of this first agenda item of 20, I might add.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'The mayor had promised to do that when he first took office in January 2015, but that wasn't funded. And we put we put that money in the budget and the city unions have been fighting to have it take effect ever since.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ever since then, as they negotiate all the union contracts of the city workers. Today, I'm really delighted that we're seeing this come to pass and the struggle is paying off. The council bill does implement that minimum wage for city workers, and according to the city unions, it will be retroactive to April 1st of last year when the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of 2014, when the funding in the 2014 budget was first planned to take effect. That means a lot. Sorry, 2015. That means a lot of Seattle's lowest paid employees will see a better paycheck soon. And really, it's it's a delight to vote yes on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also wanted to thank all the city union representatives for your tireless work. Some of you are in the chambers today on behalf of your members, and obviously you also set the benchmark for non-unionized workers. And it's very important to recognize that solidarity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's it was unconscionable that you had to work without a contract for over a year because city negotiators were trying to play hardball with you for so long. And I know that your members are voting on the contract now, and I will absolutely support them in whatever they decide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I also wanted to reiterate that if city negotiators were not willing to come to an agreement with city unions, I believe that the whole labor movement would have stood with you. And certainly I would have supported you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I really think that this is an example of how when we win one victory, we also win other victories, because that sets the trend. Just to mention a couple of things, in addition to what Councilmember Burgess said, you know, of course, first of all, maintaining defined benefit plans is a significant thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that to recognize the union in being able to hold on to that everywhere, public sector workers are under attack, being forced to accept what is essentially an austerity measure, going from defined benefit to defined contribution plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the other thing is that the wage increases are retroactive to January of last year when the old contract expired. This is particularly important because it means that union members are not penalized for holding out a good contract.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It sets a good example. And lastly, I wanted to draw attention to something I mentioned in briefing this morning. The Supreme Court today is beginning hearings on Friedrich versus Friedrichs versus the California Teachers Association. The outcome of this decision, this hearing, will have a deep impact on future organizing by public sector unions everywhere around the nation, including'",
        "'speaker_4': 'public sector unions in Seattle. So we do have to very actively support the California Teachers Association to defend the Democratic right of workers to form a union if they have a majority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, counsel. So what are there any other comments before I move for passage?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Burgess So I just want to also thank our city labor representatives that are with us today. I remember almost four years ago when we first began discussing the need for modifications to the retirement system. And at that time, the Council insisted that Labor representatives be with us at the table and that we learned together the challenges'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that we face with the retirement system. So thank you for participating in that process with us. I think we've achieved a great outcome. Contrary to what my colleague just said, I think the city and our unions bargained in good faith throughout this process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was no stalling or delaying. There were no unfair labor practices. We worked together diligently to arrive at these agreements today, and I think we can all be very proud of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Burgess. Okay, so I move to pass. I would take these individual I moved to pass counter bill 118602. Is there a second? It's been moved in second that the bill passed. Are there any other additional comments?'",

And then I can just speak to what the bill does at the very end to the mayor presented legislation to the council a little over a month ago'",
        "'speaker_8': '. We had a public hearing and a couple of committee meetings to discuss this and the bill that the mayor proposed. There's there's two measurement issues that we often conflate, and I'm trying to keep them clear here. One is around buffers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So how far do marijuana businesses have to be from certain types of other uses, like daycare parks, community centers, arcades? And then the second term we use a lot is dispersion, which is how far do marijuana retail establishments have to be from other marijuana retail establishments?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are three different levels of businesses. There's the retail establishments. There's also producers and their processors. I just want to be clear that when we're talking about dispersion, we're only talking about retailers. There's not a dispersion requirement around producers or processors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The buffer zones apply to all of them. The bill that was proposed by the mayor and came out of committee included a 500 foot buffer zone for producers, processors and retailers for the types of activities. The buffer from the types of activities that state law allows us to reduce the buffer below a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The dispersion requirement is not any requirement by state law that doesn't exist in existing city law. The bill that was proposed by the mayor's office proposed dispersion requirement of 500 feet, meaning if one retail business is located in one location, the second one could had to be at least 500 feet from that property to open up as'",
        "'speaker_8': 'it came out of committee that was amended by former Councilmember McCarter. His amendment was passed out of committee to reduce the dispersion requirement to 350 feet so businesses to retail businesses could not be within 350 feet. So we have four amendments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The First Amendment is one that I'm sponsoring. So I'm going to go ahead and speak to that and ask for a Second Amendment number one in our packet deals with the buffer zones and specifically with lower the buffer zone from 500 feet to 200 feet for the producers and processors only, not the retailers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To around 50.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Feet. What did I say? Hundred, 250 feet. Thank you. I'm getting the words right now. I need the numbers wrong. So, again, current the current ongoing bill we're talking about has a 500 foot buffer zone for all types.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This amendment would reduce that buffer from 500 feet to 250 feet just for the producers and processors, not for the retailers. Is there a second for that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I'll just speak briefly to that. My from a policy perspective, I understand the idea of having buffer zones from these certain types of uses. Again. The ones that come to mind arcades, community centers, child care centers, parks, the types of sensitive uses within the city that often have youth often have folks that specifically are prohibited from'",
        "'speaker_8': 'using marijuana. We want to keep some space between those those uses and the retail stores. The the producers and processors, on the other hand, do not have any retail presence. There's no signage. There's really no way for my understanding, for the average citizen to even know what's going on inside.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's just another business that the public doesn't have access to. So I don't believe that having a great buffer zone for those operations makes policy sense, which is why I'm supporting that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have an amendment to decrease the buffer for our producers to 250 feet. Are there any other comments? I'd like to actually make a comment, as I said this morning, that it's I'm I'm going to support the amendment, but with some level of concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that concern is, as I understand, the state's position, they are not limiting the number of production or growing licenses. I think there are policies as far as going to be sort of let the market take care of itself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Many growers, I think, are possibly going out of business because there seems to be a lot of product out there that hasn't been moving. And I'm concerned that, again, there are chemicals that are sometimes used, there are disposal issues on the grow operations, there are odor issues that neighborhoods are concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just don't think we've adequately thought through some of the unintended consequences of just increasing the number of producers. And I don't even know if we need to do that at this point. I don't think we've done that, both research or data homework or looked at the impacts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I as a policy standpoint, we have decriminalized this product and we're trying to get patients their medicine, and I'm supportive of where we're trying to head. But I just think there there's a lot of work still to be done as we lower the buffers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But generally speaking, I know there's been support on the council for this and I don't want to send away that support, but it is with some level of concern. Are there any other comments of Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just at this morning, this morning's briefing council President Harrell, you mentioned that and I had a chance, my staff had a chance to have a conversation about producer providers. And I just the reality is that this is kind of a joint regulatory effort between the city and the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And ultimately the state holds a lot of the cards is what's happening. My understanding is that the state is not in the process of issuing any more producer processor licenses. They have set a cap on the number of retail, but of course it's a state and they could change their mind at any point in the future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I don't my sense is that your concern is not something that's happening today, but obviously could become valid if the state were to change its direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Hearing no other comments will vote on this in a minute. All has been moved in. It's been moved to Amendment one, has been moved to there. A Second Amendment one to council. Bill 118580 has been moved. And second, all those in favor say I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I opposed. The ayes have it. Let's move to amendment number two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Great. So I'll speak just briefly to this and hand it off to Councilmember Herbold, who is a sponsor of this. This amendment is also about the buffer zones. This is about buffer zones for the retail operations in one specific area in the downtown zone.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Herbold So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This works off of the existing buffers in the mayor's proposed bill. The existing citywide buffers are 500 feet. This creates an exception to that of 250 feet in a specific zone. It's the downtown mixed commercial and downtown mixed residential zones.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is in the downtown urban center west of I-5, north of yester way and south of Denny Way would not apply in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Specific.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Carved out areas within the downtown urban center, including downtown office or one and two downtown Harbor Pike Place Market mixed or Pioneer Square mixed. The reason for this amendment is this is a high tourism area with cruise ships.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More will be coming soon and an existing street drug dealing problem. It's actually we've had Liz Campbell from the Belltown Community Council come and speak to us about their concern about the illicit drug trade in the area and that their desire for a legal store will hopefully eliminate that that illegal activity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In particular, I know that there were questions about. A Town ID and Pioneer Square. Those are not included. And if there are specific questions that councilmembers have about the amendment, I'd love to receive them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. So are there any comments on Councilmember her Herbold Amendment two, which, as I understand it, for retail stores lowers the buffer to 250 feet. Any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Only in those zones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Only in the specified zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I should say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So it's been amendment to Councilmember Herb also has been moved. Is there a second? Second so moved in Second Amendment number two. All those in favor say I opposed the ayes have it. Amendment number three.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So amendment number three, we're going to shift from just talking about buffer zones to talking about dispersion. The current bill before us has a dispersion requirement of stores have to be at least 350 feet from each other.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Council members purchasing Gonzalez have an amendment that would change how we calculate dispersion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So please, this amendment has to be viewed in the context of the buffer zone as well. So both the buffer and the dispersion need to be viewed together. So this would say that there cannot be more than two properties with major marijuana activity, including the retail sale within 1000 feet of each other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So a thousand feet is approximately four or five city blocks, depending on what part of town you're in. So if you think about a neighborhood business district, for example, with this amendment, there could be two retail outlets within a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the buffer is also met. So except in the downtown area, the amendments that we just passed, it would have to be 500 feet buffer between. The sensitive uses like parks, community centers, childcare facilities. But then only two allowed within 1000 feet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would move amendment number three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have amendment number three in front of us that's been moved on second. And are there any additional comments on amendment number three?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Gonzalez The only thing that I would would add to this particular amendment that I think is important for us to keep in mind is that this this particular dispersion requirement would not go into effect until it is signed by the mayor, so it becomes effective immediately upon the mayor's signature.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this does not impact current current marijuana retail locations. It would only impact the siting and zoning requirements for major marijuana activity moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for that clarification. We have amendment number three that has been properly moved in second. And all those in favor say I, I opposed the ayes have it. And Councilmember O'Brien, I believe you had Amendment four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was somewhat based on the passage of 1 to 3.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The bill, their own adventure for portion of the meeting. So amended number for the intent of a minimum of four is to go back and add some recitals justifying the changes in the buffer zones that we just made in our in our documents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are four different versions based on what could have happened earlier in the meeting, because both amendments, one and two are approved. I am going to go ahead and propose alternate RD of Amendment four, which, as is the recital language that had previously been reviewed by law to support the changes in the buffers that we just made'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay has been moved in seconded amendment number four, which is basically alter D. It's been moved in seconds for its passage. All those in favor say I. I opposed the ayes have it. Councilmember Brian, you want to make any closing remarks relative to the bill as amended?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Thank you. I want to I want to thank the mayor's staff and David Mendoza in particular for doing a lot of work over the not just the last months, but over a year. It feels like we are at the leading edge of a new industry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're trying our best to get this right. We're learning a lot, I think the the enforcement work that they've done to help transition medical providers into the recreational framework, well, not perfect. I think it is taking great steps.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to thank folks from the community for the various aspects that have done a lot of work to try and help us understand what their business environment looks like as we made these changes. I want to highlight just a couple things that we're not doing today but may come up specifically around the current legislation and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the underlying law before we passed this legislation. Both prohibit retail operations within any of our historic districts, and that is not being proposed to change today as a tourist district. Historic districts include Ballard Avenue, Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market, Columbia City, International District, and perhaps others.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There have been conversations from folks in the community who would like to lift that prohibition in both the Ballard Historic District and possibly Pioneer Square. And my conversations with community members from both Ballard and Pioneer Square was that the communities there hadn't had enough time to process and have conversations on those, but are open to possibly making'",
        "'speaker_8': 'changes in the future. And so what I have told both advocates and community members is that I will do what I can to help foster communications in the coming weeks and months. And if it seems that we can get to a place of consensus, I would certainly support coming back with legislation to make changes to those historic'",
        "'speaker_8': 'districts where we've had more process and more opportunity for people to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien. I'd like to suggest, as I support this amended bill, that we still have so much work to do. I mean, we're way beyond the issue as to whether we support decriminalization of marijuana. I mean, that that's an old debate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we've shown a strong commitment toward basically supporting this industry and making sure we regulate and tax and do all those kinds of things as well. At this point, we're also looking at trying to enrich our city and trying to educate our kids and trying to protect our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so when we talk about the environmental impacts, we talk about the people impacts, we talk about its effect on poorer or underrepresented communities. There still remains a lot of policy work to do. And this, I think, is one of the very few times where the state are actually moving faster than we are from a city standpoint'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So as they do their licenses, I think we are trying to figure this out. We also know that there are many neighboring cities as well trying to figure this out as well who may not get as many licenses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so Seattle, being such a large city that we have an opportunity to be a leader in this industry, but to do it in a very smart and concerted way. So I think that both the race and social justice impacts of what we're trying to do, the environmental impacts we still have work to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to support I want to voice my support to all of the industry participants out there, both on the medical side and recreational side for helping us create this industry. And we hope to be partners with you in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any other comments on this bill as amended, just briefly? Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also wanted to echo Councilmember O'Brien's gratitude to the mayor's office and to David Mendoza in particular, who has spent probably a countless number of hours working on this policy issue, both at the state level. And we're lucky enough to have him here at the city continuing to to provide us with his his knowledge around this particular'",
        "'speaker_5': 'industry and policy issues related to to to this new venture that we're on. I'm really pleased that this ordinance has passed. I think it's really critically important that we continue to foster an environment within the city of Seattle where we can create a competitive industry for retail marijuana businesses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that the zoning law that we've just passed will do exactly that. Of course, we have a lot of other work to do to ensure that there are no disparate impacts based on race or social justice or other important factors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First and foremost will be tackling, I think, the delivery legal delivery services system to make sure that either they are folded into the system or that we are deploying city resources appropriately to ensure that those types of illicit markets aren't hurting.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Bagshaw.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. I will be addressing this since our former colleagues, Councilmember Rasmussen and Councilmember Gordon, are not here today to do so. This particular legislation proposes a mechanism for us to ensure the financial sustainability of the Japanese garden, and the legislation proposes the transfer of the fundraising responsibilities for the Japanese garden from ARC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's her Association for Recreation Council to the Arboretum Foundation. The Arboretum Arboretum Foundation will assume responsibilities, as it does already for the Greater Arboretum. And all of you know that the Japanese garden is in the heart of the arboretum.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the foundation's duties, should we approve this will include fundraising, membership, program management, volunteer recruitment and event management, as well as fundraising and public outreach. The transfer of the duties is supported by a number of organizations, which I will speak to in just a moment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have heard some opposition from a few individuals, but what we are hearing from the Arboretum Foundation, the Parks Department, ask the Japanese Garden Advisory Board. And last week, I received a letter from Tony Omar Eguchi, who is president of the Seattle Tea Ceremony Association, that they are recommending that we proceed with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The foundation will create a Japanese garden committee with a dozen members to address the multiple needs of the garden. The Arboretum found out a foundation has staff and board members that have demonstrated interest in and involvement with the Japanese culture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you heard from several of them today, including Diana Doshi, who is here to speak to us, and Roger Williams. Also, Terry Holmes was here as a former board of Park Commission. So I'm going to just briefly talked about the basic obligations of the Arboretum Foundation, which will be to replace ARC as the primary support organization to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'recognize Seattle Parks and Recreation. That's our Parks Department. As the owner and operator of the Seattle Japanese Garden, for the garden to continue to work with the Parks Department to raise funds, recruit volunteers and so on. We will also support implementation through the Arboretum for designated events, coordinate and train volunteers, and to expand and implement the Japanese'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Garden Membership Program. There will be much more, but this is the basic outline. The committee recommended that we proceed, and as a new board member and Vice Chair of the Parks and Seattle Center Committee, I recommend that we approve this as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw. Are there any other comments on Council Bill 118595. I'll just make some comments. I'll reiterate the comments I made during the committee where I abstained, and that is that I think the goal, the goals are noble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what we're trying to do, we're trying to have a premier Seattle Japanese garden. And it seems as though if you look at Portland as the model of one of the best in the country, that they seem to develop a core competency, a certain organization that strictly focuses on that kind of entity as opposed to it being'",
        "'speaker_1': 'part of a larger portfolio. And while I think the Arboretum Foundation is an outstanding organization, my concerns was whether the Parks Department had looked at other options or what those options were, and I didn't think that they presented any other options other than sort of moving forward.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'You may recall during the committee discussion, I asked the question whether the sale Japanese garden will be a standalone five one C3 in ten or 15 years or what the plans are there. And there was somewhat of a rich conversation, sort of mixed signals there and what may make sense down the road.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But certainly as an interim step, this is what the department is at least suggesting. So I will support it, but I think a lot of work still needs to be done. So having said that, are there any other comments on this bill?'",
