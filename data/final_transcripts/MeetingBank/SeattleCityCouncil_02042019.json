Agenda Item two Resolution 318 61 Recognizing the harms that evictions from housing have on tenants and marginalized communities, and describing the City Council's plan to help avoid and mitigate those harms.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Colleagues are going to take a few minutes to walk through some of the background of here of the work on this resolution and also highlight what comes next. I want to start by thanking Councilmember Herbold for her leadership in working on this through the Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development and Arts Committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Back in September, we heard a report from the Seattle Women's Commission entitled Losing Home. You probably folks and you're probably familiar with that has been reported on in numerous times. The report included a review of all 1218 evictions, residential evictions, actions filed in Seattle in the year 2017.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition, it did some studies. I also surveyed and interviewed tenants and interviewed homeless prevention providers cross rents, cross-referenced evictions with medical examiner records, and also cross-referenced with housing code violations. There are a number of findings in this report, and I want to touch on just a few of these findings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of them was that single tenant households that faced eviction for $100 or less in back rent. Of those, 81% of those single households were women. If you're black, there was a 4.5% sorry, 4.5 times likelihood that you would face eviction than if you were white.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'People of color were more likely to be evicted for smaller amounts of money than white households. Of the over 1000 evictions, 86% were for nonpayment of rent. 52% of those were for less than one month's worth of rent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Attorney's fees were charged attendance in 90% of the cases and court costs were charged and over 92% of the cases. Those charges averaged just over $400 for attorney's fees and just under $400 for court costs. A Federal Reserve report found that 40% of Americans could not come up with $400 in the event of an emergency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When you listen to just these facts and there's a number of other findings, it should come as no surprise that the burden of evictions, often for very small amounts. And we didn't even go into some details of the reasons of these forward and the reality, financial reality that so many folks face, that it's clear that the eviction'",
        "'speaker_7': 'process in our city is broken. And it leads to a significant number of folks who go through eviction, facing homelessness, post eviction. Only 12.5% of evicted respondents found another rental. Over 37% were completely unsheltered. 25% were living in a shelter or transitional housing, and 25% ended up staying with family or friends.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we want to address our homeless crisis, there's really no way we can do that without also addressing the eviction crisis we're facing. This is not the first time that this council has taken up issues around eviction. Want to touch on a few of those?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a number of statement of legislative attempts and green sheets that we passed in the past few years. Example Preventing evictions for substandard properties and creating a legal path for tenants to enforce their rights in court. We've passed green sheets, increasing coordinated funds for legal defense and tenant outreach funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recommended process for centralizing for obtaining assistance in one place, but without fundamental reform to the eviction process, will continue to see some of the challenges we facing. This resolution alone is not going to solve this crisis, but it lays out a path and a framework following on recommendations from the Women's Commission report that the city can take'",
        "'speaker_7': 'if we want to reduce this crisis. I'm going to touch on a couple of the next steps that are that we believe we can accomplish in the relatively near term, and that this resolution lays out the groundwork for us to move forward on some of those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One is to address financial hardship for tenancies piercing domestic violence, who often are held liable for damages caused by the perpetrator. We can address the lack of flexibility to avoid eviction when faced with emergencies. Hope to address high default rates for evictions arising from not understanding the eviction process or mutual termination agreements, which are often entered into'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in a one sided nature where the tenant doesn't understand their rights and responsibilities and what resources may be available to avoid eviction hardship for paying rent from an additional burden on top of late payments for rent, that late fees, court costs and attorney's fees compound and make it almost impossible for many folks to recover from late payment'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Also, the courts generally have not have the flexibility to exercise judicial discretion to prevent evictions. We heard in public testimony today of a woman in South Carolina who was in the hospital and so was unable to make payment in our state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She would have three days to pay or vacate. And the reality that someone who was in a hospital would be able to respond to that in any meaningful way is almost nil resulting likely resulting in our system in an eviction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Whereas in other jurisdictions there's at least a path where family members or advocates can show up in court, explain the circumstances to a judge in a judge could say, under these circumstances, I'm not going to proceed with this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Rarely do we see that flexibility in our system. Colleagues, I ask for your support on this resolution. I want to thank the Seattle Women's Commission for their work on making this happen, bringing forward and highlighting this, and recognize that there's a lot of work in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I want to thank folks in Olympia who are also taking this seriously, in large part because of the work that our Women's Commission did, to highlight some of the the circumstances that we face. This is not just, of course, in Seattle, but it's happening throughout the region.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe Piers King in Sandwich County account for about half of the evictions in Washington State. And so we were able to address this just in the central Puget Sound region. It would go a long way to helping the people of the entire state.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Catherine and Brian Catherine back show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Brian, I certainly support your work here. Thank you for you and Councilmember Herbold and Swann for the work you've done in your committee. Can you tell me when you said that you're working with Olympia, what actions are are being taken?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there legislation that's introduced now? And who are the key sponsors?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The there are multiple pieces of legislation that are in play in Olympia right now, and I am not going to be able to speak at length to the details of them. The current state law has a three day paid vacation and is there bills that would both allow 14 or 21 days?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe Representative Macri is supporting legislation that would extend it to 21 days, but there's a Republican sponsored bill that would be 14 days. But I would suggest that that at our next briefing, when we have our offer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Office of Immigrant Relations for them to speak to the variety of bills that are down there. Senator Krueger is also working on a series of bills about eviction. I think what I will say at the high level, Councilmember Bagshaw, is what's really apparent in Olympia this year is there's bipartisan support to address this crisis around evictions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and so regardless of what community you're coming from, people are seeing this as a real problem. And, well, I know advocates have been working on this for years. It appears that there is a higher likelihood this session that we might see some traction on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That doesn't relieve the city from doing some work, too, because there's a role for us to play. And the legislation that Councilmember Herbold has led on this resolution, I think helps lay out those next steps, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Any further comments? Councilmember Mosquito.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. I just wanted to take a quick second to thank Councilmember Herbold and Swan O'Brien. Everybody who's had a hand in this legislation in Washington can so choose, right. We here in Seattle are embarrassingly behind where other cities and states are in terms of the eviction policy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also wanted to take a quick second to thank the Seattle Women's Commission, the Housing Justice Project, for all of the work that they put into the losing home report. The eviction process and the landlord tenant law here is at best complex.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think, as we've heard today, as truly unjust in terms of clarity, we lack clarity for landlords. We also lack clarity for tenants. And having the opportunity to clarify this, to create a more just system to work with tenants and advocates in the courts to find the path forward, not only as the process that will result'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for better clarification for all parties, but will help us continue the work of what we heard just two weeks ago on the Select Committee, that we need to do a much better job to provide easier and quicker assistance to prevent individuals from being evicted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If an individual calls and they said they need $200 and they need $400 just to get through the next few months, don't make them go through a rigorous process. Just allow them to be the best managers of their situation and help them get through that tough period so that they don't get evicted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is what the experts are telling us from across the country, and it's what the experts on the ground level have been saying for so long. I'm really excited to work on this. We also know that this, in conjunction with additional tenant protections and building housing, is really the solution that goes hand in hand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We know that housing discrimination and risk of eviction increases when there is not enough affordable housing, when there is low vacancies, and when we don't have enough affordable units for those in need. So as we work to build additional housing, I'm really excited that we are going to be able to begin the process of legislating this intentional'",
        "'speaker_1': 'work around protecting our tenants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Casper Mosquito Council members who want.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, President Harrell. I would urge those of us who haven't been able to look at it yet to watch the really important testimony that was given during the public comment section of the committee last week when government was horrible, the brain injury.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we voted this resolution out of the committee and I really hope everybody will be voting yes on this resolution in preparation for the ordinances that need to come following this. Some of you may have also read the study conducted by a commission by the Seattle Women's Commission with the support of trans rights activists from the Washington'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Community Action Network. And of course, most importantly, the Housing Justice Project. This is you know, I don't often recommend, you know, that people read greetings, but this is actually very, very useful because it has statistical information on how bad the crisis is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it is not a small thing. It is and it is something that is happening citywide. And we know that most people who are affected in Seattle do not even have a lawyer present. And in fact, these numbers are based on people who went to court.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know that statistically speaking, there are a lot more who didn't go to court because they don't have the resources or the time or the support social support structure to go and challenges in court. So clearly, this is a very important issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm really happy that to the people's budget movement last year we were able to win city funding for the first, first ever city funding for of eviction, you know, for for for attorneys to help with renters who are facing eviction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that is far from enough. We need much more than that. And we know also the terrible impacts of eviction, the renters. And that's where this report is also very useful. Not only do evictions affect people's health stress, I mean, people have, you know, really compelling stories of how it affects their life long held because of the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'stress that they go through, how it affects their children and their future housing prospects, because it follows you everywhere you go. And we also know that deadly connection now that has been established between evictions and homelessness and even death in some cases, and not all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, last but not least, a connection between race and other issues that people face, other oppression that people face, and the likelihood of being evicted, likelihood of facing homelessness. And just to look at the numbers on average, and this study shows us this in 2017, there were almost three evictions every day in Seattle and in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'District three, which has Capitol Hill, the Central District, many working people living in the district. Evictions happen more than once every two days. So these are just stark numbers we are looking at for a city like Seattle. And as was stated by other, you know, renters in other states actually have many rights and eviction court and Washington'",
        "'speaker_6': 'state is lagging like far, far behind. So obviously, I will be supporting this resolution. But most importantly, I think renters need to continue to get organized to make sure the ordinances that are developed following the resolution also get passed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as part of organizing, I would really urge everybody who is watching this to join my office by Seattle and Tenants Union of Washington State in the number of boot camps, renters rights bootcamps that we're having. Just this past Saturday, we had a boot camp at Vermillion and on Capitol Hill, and we had a number of renters'",
        "'speaker_6': 'come there not only to learn about their rights and the specific questions they had. And there's some horror stories with corporate landlords, but also how to get organized. In fact, there was a point where one of the people who was attending there said, hey, when are we going to talk about organizing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which is, you know, very, very it's really it's really gratifying to see that renters are realizing that this is something that they need to get organized around. So just very quickly, I wanted to say that in the Central District will be having another renters rights bootcamp on Thursday, February 7th, at 630 at the Garfield Community Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're having two renters rights boot camps in the University District one on February 9th, which is a Saturday at 10 a.m., and on February 13th on at 6 p.m., which is a weekday. And you can find all this information by contacting my office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are also hosting a special renters rights boot camp that will focus on LGBTQ questions and how LGBTQ renters can get organized. That will be on Capitol Hill on March 6th. I think I might be getting the date wrong, but it will be at the Wildrose Bar on Capitol Hill.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So please join us and let's get organized.'",
