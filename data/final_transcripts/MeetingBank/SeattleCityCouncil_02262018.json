        "'speaker_5': 'The Report of the Civic Development to Public Assets and Native Community Communities Committee. Agenda Item one Resolution 31783. Addressing a proposed financial gas facility in Tacoma and urging the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency to improve tribal consultation procedures and collaborate with regional mayors, leaders and tribes to address the growing impact of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Just to sort of narrate how this should occur. I'll ask that councilmember were sort of introduce the base resolution and describe it and any details you'd like. And I know we have at least three amendments that I'm aware of, two proposed by councilmember, so wanted, one by Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll take those in that order. And having said that, councilmember words, the floor is yours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. First of all, President Harrell and colleagues, I'd like to thank Councilmember Miller, Councilmember Rideout, Councilmember Bain and Councilmember Bryant for attending today. And of course, Ramona Bennett, former chair of The Proud Nation, for being here. I really appreciate your words and your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The resolution before us today is resolution 31793. It was discussed at full council on January 29th. At that meeting, the council decided that for the discussion of the resolution was needed, and yet it was referred to my committee Civic Development, Public Assets and Native Communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Last Wednesday was historic. We had the Tribal Council on a government to government relationship and discussion here at the table. We unanimously move this resolution out of committee with recommendation for passage of full council today. Those present who voted yes were Councilmember Gonzalez, Councilmember Macheda, Councilmember Sawant, Councilmember O'Brien and myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm very proud of the work that we did to bring it to get it passed unanimously. I want to thank again the tribal elected leaders that attended. That would be Councilmember Bryant. Councilmember Bean and Councilmember Rideout, not only who attended committee, but provided valuable comments in government government consultation regarding the concerns of the LNG plant, which they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'eloquently described, that those emissions going up and a would would affect the city of Seattle as well, that any toxics, any pollutants are not going to stay in Pierce County, but affect not only the people, the native folks of Salish, but all of those communities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also discussed the makeup of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, in which there are, I believe, six or I'm sorry, three counties with nine tribes present in those counties in which more than a majority are truly tribes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've worked very closely with the Puyallup Tribal Council and other tribal leaders, including from other tribes, who called me to tell me what they believe over the last several weeks to come to a consensus in agreement about government to government in this resolution and what it means.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ironically, I believe we're all in the same place. I understand that you would like the two amendments, but I also have to stay true to the spirit and the resolution I'm sorry, true to the Spirit and the discussions that I have had with my colleagues and other elected leaders, in order for this to move forward with the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'votes that we want to make it clear where the city of Seattle stands. I believe this is the best resolution true to the spirit of Pel tribe's resolution in response to the PSC LNG plant. This resolution pays respect to the tribe's sovereignty and urges the Puget Sound Clear Air Agency to improve its government to government tribal consultation'",
        "'speaker_1': 'procedures. And that is not just a nicety, but it's the federal law and treaties are the supreme law of the land. This resolution also urges the Clean Air Agency to collaborate with regional leaders to address the impacts of climate change and invest in clean energy that will reduce regional lines on fossil fuels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, I want to emphasize with climate change, the people that are most affected in disparately is Indian country and Indian people. Before I go any further, I want to make a few things clear from I was happy to hear and always happy to hear people coming to give public comment and offer their allyship and friendship in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'supporting the Puyallup tribe. This is a known non-binding resolution. It is not a law. We are not making a law today. We are taking a position on climate change. We've taken a position on government to government consultation. And we were taking a position that the tribes need a tribal consultation, and that's how we should all act moving'",
        "'speaker_1': 'forward. The tribe's resolution speaks the most powerful and is very eloquent and president. I'd like to read some of that into the record. It is attached to. The original resolution. But I think the chairman steroids words are very powerful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what the tribal council passed on January 18th should be read into the record, if I may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'd also, before I state any more, as I share with all tribal leadership, it is safe to say this is not the end of this City Council's involvement with the Tribal Council and the LNG plant. This is just one step.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've had many discussions about how this city council is going to move forward in regards to our concerns regarding this plant. One of the most powerful things about the tribe is their way of becoming forward and speaking on behalf of their people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But the other people that non-citizens that live within their traditional land, the pale of tribe, said, be it resolved, a PRB tribe is strictly opposed to the Puget Sound Energies proposed LNG plant on the Tacoma Tide Flats, and the Puyallup Tribe has approved the attached statement as its official statement regarding the LNG plant being constructed by Puget'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sound Energy. Make no mistake, the tribe's words are the most powerful and the most compelling not only for the city of Seattle, but all the cities that belong to the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency. The Tribe of Indians opposes the location of the liquefied natural gas storage facility because of its direct threat to their homeland culture, way'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of life and tribal members. The tribe makes five, very five major points that are both powerful, and it certainly reflects their sovereign status as leaders as they always have been in the Pacific Northwest. Indeed, if it weren't for the Puyallup Nation Squabbling Nation, we would not even have had the bold decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The book that was held up earlier from the seventies, I actually read that when I was in college, part of the official record. What I like to include in here are the words of Councilor I'm sorry, President, the chair of the nation, the tribes of Indians is exercising its authority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a sovereign nation. We are taking legal action against PSC, the city of Tacoma because they conducted the EIC process without consultation with the tribe. We are working with other tribes in our region to insist that federal, state and local officials ensure compliance with all permitting requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are demanding that PSC cease construction activities until all tribal consultation and public participation requirements are met with all permit requirements are satisfied. We are demanding that the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of the PSC facility be adequately analyzed and that this information is released to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And finally, we call on the city of Tacoma and the Port of Tacoma to order a supplemental environmental health and safety review under the State Environmental Protection Act. I read these words into the record because, again, this is the most powerful document that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is attached in part of the record for Seattle City Council's resolution today. And I just want to end on a more personal note that you will not find anyone who is like me, who was born and raised on the the tribe, grew up in the city of Tacoma, more committed to making sure that this plant doesn't'",
        "'speaker_1': 'go forward. But I have to respect the process of the Sale City Council and my colleagues. And I think it's fair to say that we have teed this issue up on a national level where you have a voice and we will continue to do that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to thank those council members that have reached out to me more than once to talk to me and walk me through what issues were most important to them. I don't ever believe and I still don't sit here today thinking that this is about one council member versus another or one group is more important or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'any other or any movement did anything. I think what it comes down to for me as a native person is who has that treaty, right? The lamination stopped cherry the cherry point issue. It was a swing miss nation that stopped the oil trains.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would be the tribe that stops this plant. And that's why I believe in government to government consultation and respecting the sovereignty of a nation. And it doesn't mean that I don't believe and don't respect the activists, the environmentalists and the people that live in Tacoma.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I have to be cognizant of the construct in which I work, and that's an elected member of the Seattle City Council. So with that, I'll leave it and then I'll make a motion to move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Can spin worse for your explanation of your very hard work on this. I'm aware and have been sort of properly served with amendments potential here. And so council members want to believe that the First Amendment you'd like to address.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, President Harrell. I have two amendments that I will move and also have some general points that I will make when I talk about the First Amendment. But first I'll move and then I'll need a second. So I move amendment number one, which removes from a whereas clause Pierce's greenwashing language that falsely reads quote and data'",
        "'speaker_3': 'shows that LNG is one choice to fuel some ships and provide natural gas to residential and commercial customers to reduce sulfur emissions, harmful diesel particulate matter by 90%, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions by 90%, and carbon dioxide emissions by 35% over that of diesel or bunker fuel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And court. So again, this amendment would remove that language from the whereas clause. I'll need a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been looked. Amendment one striking out the language. The state about Councilman Swann has been properly moved. And second Councilmember Swann.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, President. How is that? I wanted to start with a few general comments. First of all, want you pay my respect to the Duwamish, people whose land we are standing on, and my respects to all the tribal leaders and tribal representatives who have spoken not just today, but as they said last week, they've been speaking out'",
        "'speaker_3': 'on these issues not only for years and their own lives, but for generations. This has been an intergenerational fight against climate change and for the basic rights of our native communities and for all people. I wanted to thank particularly the Puyallup Tribal Council members, many of whom are here Councilmember David Bean, Annette, Brian, Sylvia miller and James'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rideout, thank you so much for coming here. It has been our honor as the Seattle City Council has my personal honor as a council member and as a representative of working people of Seattle who recognizes that there really is no division and there should not be any division between ordinary people in Tacoma and ordinary people in Seattle'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We stand together, and if that solidarity does not exist on an issue like climate change, then what issue cannot exist on because our fates are bound together. So I am so grateful. I'm also grateful to the many, many activists who have made made us come this far.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm obviously not going to mention all the names, but Matt Rumley and Dakota Case, who actually met with my staff member, Ted Worden on November 30th of last year, who are the office? The involvement of my office started at that moment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as I mentioned, you know, activists like urban activists like Madam Liz are a writer and also environmental and labor activists like Valerie Piven, Pam Kiely, Nanette Reeds, many of whom are from Tacoma. Really appreciated Amy Madden here, who reminded us that we are not alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'District after district of the Democratic Party has taken an unequivocal position on the LNG plant. That is a really important input. Thank you so much. I also want to thank brother Vince O'Halloran from the Maritime Trades, who representing Maritime Trades Workers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a member of the labor movement. I stand with you and I appreciate you and your the workers you represent standing with the tribes. That is a really, really important voice as well. And I want to thank all the ordinary people, not just in Seattle or Tacoma, but around the world, who are clear about the science.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As as Patricia Ireland said, you know, we are clear about the science. The only people who have an incentive in not being clear about the science are the executives and billionaire shareholders of fossil fuel companies who are the only ones who are going to benefit from this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's really, really important that we have been here together opposing this LNG plant. As other speakers have said, much better than I can. This is a violation of treaty rights. It's a violation of Puyallup sovereignty. And it is an attack on all Native communities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as you all know, I strongly support all the language that was added to the first version to strengthen the position of the tribes of treaty rights and of improving tribal consultation. I think that was really important changes that were brought in and I strongly support them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also think, though, that some key improvements need to be made that were taken out of our original resolution and then introduced in the new resolution some things that we don't agree with. And those things have already been mentioned by councilmembers Bryan and Rideout and also every other speaker who spoke today who has supported these amendments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm speaking now on Amendment One, but in general, I would say about both amendments. Last week at committee, the whole issue was presented as if our movement is divided. But today, council members, you see that the movement of native leaders, native tribes and tribal members and environmental activists and social justice activists are all speaking with one'",
        "'speaker_3': 'voice. Everybody has spoken with one voice saying that we are we are not divided. We are not divided. We are unambiguously clear. We do not want Pearce's LNG facility in Tacoma, period. That is absolutely the bottom line. And with respect, I would disagree with the point that the process of the Seattle City Council is the most of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the most sacred or the most important. What is the most sacred? And the most important is the rights of our people and of the people of tribe. And while the resolution yes, it's true that it's legally non-binding, but it is an important step in our struggle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why do this resolution in the first place if it was not going to give a voice to our movement and to the native communities who are fighting longer? And if we're doing it, then let's do it right. The Amendment one, if passed, would remove the greenwashing language and Alec CONAN and others activists have shown very clearly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I had my own prop, but this can't compete with your prop. Oh, but as you have said, clearly, the language comes almost verbatim from Pierce's PR greenwashing language. Let us not make the mistake of putting this, you know, etching this in stone in a city council resolution of an important city like Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's make sure that we don't get our talking point from PSC, which has no incentive to worry about climate change and every incentive to think about their own profits. And by the way, they are also not thinking of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About the ratepayers. So I will urge the Council to vote yes on this amendment. I am happy to explain the science again. I read these points out many times. I have them, but I don't want to take too much time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm happy to read them if council members want me to. However, what I would request. As you have heard from the community, they have spoken with one voice. They are not divided on this. They want you to pass this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that is the most important thing here. That is the most binding, in my view. That is the most binding aspect of this whole process. And if we are if we are to uphold Puyallup sovereignty, then the Seattle City Council should not be taking talking points from a corporation that is attacking the sovereignty.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I will urge the Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To pass this amendment. And if council members are going to vote against it, I would like to hear a real reason why it's being opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I am going to support this amendment partially in anticipation of an amendment that Councilmember O'Brien is going to be bringing forward subsequent to to these amendments. And I just want to speak directly to this question of of of the language being greenwashing language and and whose interest it is intended to represent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a lot that has been said about the language coming from this website. I want to say the reason why I supported inclusion of this language is because of correspondence I received not from PSC but from the Puget Sound Ports Council, Maritime Trades Department of the AFL-CIO on behalf of thousands of men and women from the region'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that work aboard these ships. And I want to just read from that email. As you may know, most cargo ships today run on diesel or bunker fuel, heavy fuel oils. The proposed facility would provide a critical opportunity to improve air quality for so many of our workers by using a fuel source that reduces over 90% of pollutants'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and reduces greenhouse gases by 15 to 25% as opposed to vessels using PFOS. We believe that the Port of Tacoma, as proposed LNG facility provides a cleaner, safer alternative for our workers that are out and around these ships every day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Currently, a tote ship servicing Alaska and calling in Tacoma uses 156 workers. A voyage, a voyage, including 80 longshoreman, 37 mechanics, 12 tug crew members, 25 officers and crews and two pilots. These vessels make 50 voyages a year, and that's 156 fewer employees per vessel per call.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this does not include the several hundred truckers driving on and off the docks while the vessels are loading, loading and unloading. So I just want folks to understand that there are there are interests that relate specifically to health concerns for our workers that were were supported by this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By this legislation. I am supporting removal of it because I do believe it's been become a distraction. And I think the strength of the process thus far is really that we have focused on the things that all voices in the social justice community, including labor, can get behind.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay, Councilwoman Bryant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. First of all, I want to thank you, Councilmember Wise, for your leadership on this work. I want to say that the community meeting you held last week and having tribal elected tribal leadership at the county at the council table was a really powerful experience for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know that that would not have happened without your leadership. I wish I could say that we've been doing that for years, but we haven't. But we should be doing that going forward. And I want to thank the tribal leaders who honored us with their presence yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to just recommit to an ongoing relationship and dialog on all issues, not just with the trial, not just with the Puyallup, but with all tribes in the region. So thank you so much for being part of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will I will also be supporting this amendment. When I look at the language that we're proposing to strike, I see two different things that are roughly touched upon. One is that the language talks about harmful diesel particulate matter and specifically players about what the impact that has on actual workers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm going to propose an amendment after Councilmember Swan has done to make sure that we have language in this resolution that talks about our serious concerns for workers, but also talks about a path forward for making sure workers are protected and the climate is protected and the communities are protected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other thing that this the language does is it talks about and certainly makes implications about the climate impacts of of LNG that I think are very misleading, intentionally misleading. The what we know is that, well, certainly carbon dioxide emissions may be reduced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Climate impact comes from more than just carbon dioxide. It also comes from methane. And the methane impacts of natural gas are significantly more impactful than carbon dioxide. We've talked about that at other meetings, so I won't go into more depth about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think it's really important for the city council not to have as part of a resolution language that sends a misleading measure that somehow converting to natural gas is going to be good for the climate because it's not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will speak further to my amendment when the time is right in a few moments. Very good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we have a an amendment that's been properly moved in second. So we will and I'll ask her one to vote by hand and voice at the same time. So all those council members in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Quickly to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They've already spoken to the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just want just 30 seconds. Okay. To the amendment, I. Yeah, I really think that and Brian makes an important point. I don't I appreciate Councilmember Herbals voting yes on this. That's really, really important. And that is much appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think, though, that this this amendment is a distraction. It is really important that we don't buy into the greenwashing language because it is extremely misleading. If you look at the entire lifecycle of LNG from the time that the water is fracked to the time that it comes to the plant, it if you look at all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of that whole lifecycle, it is extremely damaging. It is extremely damaging to the planet. There's all kinds of studies that link increased rates of miscarriages for women with fracked water. I mean, there's there's any amount of science that shows that this is extremely harmful and misleading language.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I didn't say that the amendment was a distraction. I said the existing language was a distraction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And consumer expert, I want to hear your apology. The reason why I hesitated was I've been recently going over the council rules and I found this rule that I wasn't quite aware about. Any council member can't speak twice on the same issue or twice in the same motion, which I don't think we've been enforcing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the exception that as a person who makes the motion can can also enter the debate. So you are well within our rights to and that's why I sort of hesitated. So okay, we have a live amendment and so we'll do it by voice in hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So all those in favor of amended amendment number one, as stated by council members want, please raise your hand and say I, I, I, I mean, you said it. Okay? All those opposed say no and raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. So what? So it fails in Casper. Just wanted to give an amendment number two as well. Yeah. Yeah. Councilmember Sawant, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, I move amendment two, which adds the words quote and reject Pierce's application for a permit, the proposed LNG facility, unquote. The list of actions of the Seattle City Council urges the Puget Sound Cleaner Agency do. They can get a second than I can speak a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a lot of amendment and property moved in second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So this language was part of my original resolution, which was drafted in coordination with native leaders and other environmental activists who brought this issue to my office in the first place. And what they indicated was that it is it would be really powerful for the movement to take a message on words that said that the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seattle City Council had very clearly as the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency to reject the permit, because that's a that's a very clear action to the Puget Sound cleaner agency can take. And to quote elder Ramona Bennett, B.C. does not care because B.C. has a lot of political clout.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have a lot of wealth on their side. So they have already brazenly started their work there. They will say that they have stopped, but I have been informed by activist that's not true. And I do hope to visit the site as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Asked me last time and I really want to do that. But the point being that he really has no incentive to listen to our voice unless we have a powerful movement from below that is standing in solidarity with the Puyallup tribe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for that to happen, I think it is a very important thing that the resolution from the Seattle city, which is, you know, which is a very powerful voice, say very clearly that we are asking that Puget Sound clear and Clean Air Agency to reject the permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Comes from Swan. Any further comments on amendment number two? CNN will do by voice vote again. Amendment two is articulated by councilmembers. One has been moved in second and all those in favor of amendment to please say I in raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those opposed. Say no and raise your hand. No. So amendment number two fails, I believe. And another Amendment two, however, has resurfaced. And so we'll call in amendment number two, and that is described by Councilmember O'Brien. Councilman Brian, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm going to pull up my prompt on how I'm supposed to introduce this amendment. So. I will go ahead and move to amend Resolution 31793 by adding a new seventh recital entitled. Whereas, workers exposed to harmful particulate matter from vessels burning, diesel or bunker fuel is a serious health concern.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Seattle City Council supports finding energy alternatives that both protect workers and our climate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For a second. It's been moved in second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this was originally the intent was to do this as a replacement for the language that we that just failed unfortunately striking that clause about from Puget Sound Energy. But it can stand on its own. So I'll continue to move it forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I mentioned before, I think it's important that to signify that we do care about the health impacts of workers that are directly impacted and that we believe that we can find solutions that meet both the health impacts of the workers, that protect the safety of the communities in the immediate vicinity, and also protect our climate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Comes from Brian. Any further comments about amendment number two, consumer awareness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President. First of all, I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for the letter that she read into the record, because those issues were brought to my attention as well. And I also want to thank Councilmember O'Brien for discussing this amendment with me this morning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate the time that you took for us to sit down and go through this and why it was important for that reason to be supporting this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Worsening for the comments. So we'll do a voice vote and handle the same time again. All those in favor of amendment number two as articulated by Councilmember O'Brien. Please raise your hand and say I by all those opposed, say no and raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the ayes have it. Okay. So we have an amended resolution. And Councilmember Waters or any other councilmembers, would you like to say anything before we pass a final vote on the amended resolution? Really good. Okay. Those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please vote i. I those opposed vote no. The motion carries and the amended resolution is adopted in the chair will sign it. Thank you very much. Please read the next agenda item into the record.'"
