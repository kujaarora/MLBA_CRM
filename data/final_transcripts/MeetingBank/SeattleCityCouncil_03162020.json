    "AN ORDINANCE appropriating money to pay certain audited claims for the week of March 2, 2020 through March 6, 2020 and ordering the payment thereof.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Moving on to committee reports, agenda item number one item. Please read this item into the record. Every part of the City Council agenda item one Capital 119 754 relating to employment in Seattle and many sections 14.6 18.0 ten and point 0/30 get on this account to strengthen and clarify labor standards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Requirements for paid sick and paid staff. Time for employees working in Seattle. Declaring an emergency. Establishing an immediate effective date all by a three fourths vote at the City Council. Thank you, Madam Clerk. I move to pass Council Bill 11975.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there's a second, then we can have discussion. Okay. Okay. It's been moved and seconded to pass a bill. 119754. Several colleagues. This is a bill that I have had the chance to work on with members of the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's a place in my office who leads us on labor for actually a number of months prior to the outbreak of COVID 19. I want to note that Carina Bohl is on the call with us from central staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We appreciate her being here with us as lead on labor issues. So many questions. We're happy to have Carina weigh in as well. And I'm happy to provide some context about this bill. In addition to the information I shared with you last week, we had engaged in conversations for a number of months with labor organizations and community'",
        "'speaker_0': 'groups and child care advocates, folks like Rachel Adler, who you may remember from these law folks that protect 17 hour city union moms, raising Martin Luther King, County Labor Council and Civic Ventures. The conversation around coronavirus actually meant that we needed to expedite the passage and consideration of the legislation in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we heard from our conversations with these stakeholders this year and early last year was that their stories repeatedly of parents and caregivers who were worried about being able to take time off if their family members childcare is closed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is very urgent and it remains urgent, even with the executive order issued by Governor Inslee and the school board over the last few days. The conversations revolve around the fact that there are schools and early learning facilities, child care centers, daycare centers that sometimes end up closing due to public safety or public health concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those closures are not mandated by a public official. As you see in the legislation in front of you, our attempt here is to try to address that concern by removing the language requiring a closure of a school or an early learning facility, daycare center to be closed at the mandate of a public official if a child'",
        "'speaker_0': 'care facility or a place where a dependent goes is closed. We thought that it was really imperative that the workers who have their kiddos there are also able to access their paid and sick days. This conversation is critical now with the closures of many schools and childcare facilities who are closing out of an abundance of caution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And even when asked at the federal level, President Trump was asked to address whether or not this means that daycares are supposed to close and they had no good answer. Basically, they said, We'll need to get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in the meantime, many of our excellent childcare providers, early learning centers, small schools are closing out of an abundance of caution without a public official mandating it. We want to make sure that those parents can access their paid sick and safely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It also is really important for us to think about how this could be considered in the context of closures for deep cleaning teacher services, snow closures, issues that are broader than coronavirus. This will allow those parents to access their paid, sick and safe days when the school is closing out of those safety issues as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This allows for parents to be able to put food on the table and not worry about losing a day's wage when their dependents place of care is closing. So I understand that we are doing as much as we can to really help with small businesses, make sure that their wages for individuals losing their jobs, make sure that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'there's health care and access to information. The policy in front of us today, I think, is complementary to that effort to make sure that there's peace of mind for parents. This is one small piece of the puzzle to make sure that workers can access their paid, sick and safe leave if a school closure or a childcare or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'early learning place of care. If the entity is closing without a public officials directive, then there's no question the parents can access that care. Credible is with us from central staff, and I believe that there's also some potential amendments to come to this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So before we get into potential amendments, I want to see if there's any questions from our colleagues about the legislation, the underlying legislation in front of you. Okay. Hearing none. Thank you enough for being on the line with us that you could stay on the line just in case there's additional questions about the amendments that would be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'very helpful. Council colleagues. If there is a sorry council colleagues, Councilmember Herbold has an amendment that I would love for her to address. Councilmember Herbold, would you like to address your amendment? Sorry I was done. I moved to amend Council Bill 11 9754 as presented on Amendment two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I can have a second, I can describe it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oops. Thank you. Just go ahead. Thank you. And so what this amendment would do is it would fill some gaps that exist, similar to the description from Council President Pro Tem mosqueda about situations where workers can access their paid sick and safe time when a public official has closed a business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This also would fill a gap in those instances when a business has closed for health or safety related reasons. But that closure has not occurred at the behest of a public official. And so whereas Governor Inslee's order from from today will cover employees of restaurants, bars, entertainment, recreational facilities and retail outlets with reduced occupancy and gathering of'",
        "'speaker_0': '50 or more people. And those individuals who work at those establishments under this order and under, excuse me, existing, paid, sick and safely laws will be able to access their paid sick and safely. But our existing paid sick and safely does not cover discretionary closures that businesses may or may decide independently of an order to close.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And may potentially not cover situations where there are reduced operations but not small business closures. And so this amendment is an attempt to fill that gap, but also recognizing the impacts to to to medium and small businesses for potentially having to pay 100% of their their second safely time if they do see a need themselves for for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'closure. So I'm trying to balance what I think is a a fair approach to allow workers to access a bank that they already have, but also recognizing that there are there are impacts to small and moderate businesses. Another gap that this that this amendment would fail is that under current employment security department rules, employees must wait for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'one week before receiving unemployment benefits for a standby claim. And so employers under this amendment could use paid safe time while waiting for employment, unemployment insurance benefits for a temporary layoff. And then finally, there is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Federal legislation that identifies qualifying needs. This this amendment would allow employees to use paid save time for qualifying needs that are not currently covered under the proposed federal bill. H.R. 6201. Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Other questions about Councilmember Herbold amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment number two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is Councilmember Peterson. I've got a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Cosmo Petersen, please go ahead. And for the council's reference, we have amendment number one that Councilor Petersen and I are working on as well, that we will go back to Councilmember Petersen questions on a number two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, thank you for this amendment and for being thoughtful about small and midsize businesses just for the for the general public. Tier three employer is that employees with 250 or more employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And is it your intent that this you know, this particular ordinance, the the whereas is and the findings are focused predominantly on the current coronavirus crisis, and that certainly bringing into sharp relief how we want to take a harder look at the paid sick and safely policies that that you worked on many years ago actually to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'found those for the city. And is it your intent that we're understanding that this amendment would have this change be a permanent change even beyond the current crisis?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Great question. I know that council member or council president pro tem mascara has other sort of cleanup envisioned for paid sick and safe leaves at a later date. I would be perfectly happy to take a look at this at this policy at the appropriate time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did want to also let you know that the Office of Labor Standards points to a desire to have some consistency between the three tiers. And I've reached out to the to the mayor's office, both the labor liaison and the mayor's office business liaison.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have been told that they are fine with the amendment as drafted. They understand the Office of Labor Standards point about the they preferred approach to have consistency between the three tiers, but feel that we could reevaluate that in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I really appreciate you reaching out to the executive department that would be overseeing it as well as you're saying the business liaison as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you for doing that outreach because I know things are moving really fast around here. So I just want to flag my concern for you. You know, I am very open to looking at these policy changes that would be made permanent in the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I'm a little concerned about doing it so quickly here. I'm not it's not necessarily not a good idea. It's just that it's happening fast. And I don't and I'm glad to hear that that outreach was done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That makes me feel a lot more comfortable. So thanks for answering my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. And I will I will I will send you the the language that I received from the mayor's office. In response, I already shared it with council president pro tem mosqueda. I'll send it to you as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Have never heard council councilmember colleagues. Is there any additional question for Councilmember Herbold on amendment number two? Sure? None. Councilmember Hubble, thank you for your work on this. As you mentioned, I think that this is in line with the directive that the governor has also hope that many employers will take advantage of, and that has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'also expanded access to leave options at the state level. I think that this is a friendly amendment and a really well timed amendment. And as you mentioned, we will again come back to this question about second safely and see what other clean up legislation is needed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hopefully you knock on wood when times come back to normal. So we will engage in the robust stakeholder engagement of that process as well and look forward to having you and Councilor Paterson as well involved in that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your support. Thank you. Hearing no other comments or questions on amendment number two, will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of Amendment number two as outlined by Councilmember Hubble? Councilmember Strauss.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'This is amendment number one, which I am supporting along with Councilmember Peterson. Copy number. Peterson is the prime sponsor of this amendment. Would you like to speak to it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilmember. This amendment is adding a finding to the council bill to basically add clarity that this change regarding schools and places of care will go on in the future, that it's not just during this crisis and just felt it was important to signal to the general public that it this is this is not just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'about the pandemic, but it would go beyond that. And I really appreciate councilmember skater's leadership on this and also being very open to my questions during the process. I know there's there's been a lot of common ground and unity during this crisis by this council, and I really appreciate that continuing here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Happy to answer any questions.'",

Council colleagues, the amendment, number one and number two have been adopted into the bill.'",

I will be supporting this ordinance, of course, to clarify that Seattle's basic and safe dime is available to workers who need to take time off to care for a family member if their school or other place of care'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is shut down. And I appreciate the presence of the mosquito and other council members on this effort. The qualifier that is going to be removed from the underlying ordinance is important. And of course, I would hope that even with the original language, the law would be applied in the case as we hope to be, hopefully will be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'applied to. But it's good to make it clear that it does and I will be supporting that. I do want you to know that as we know this this the vote today that we will be taking today and the underlying ordinance, unfortunately, do not still do not address the most pressing limitations that workers face, which is the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'lack of guaranteed paid leave, whether it's here or nationally, and that workers only have access to, at most a few paid station sick days per year, which we know is not nearly not nearly enough time in normal circumstances, and certainly not sufficient to cover the time people might end up having to spend in quarantine in the context'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of a pandemic or the months the schools might be shut down. You know, workers accrue one hour of paid saving sick time every 30 or 40 hours work, depending on the size of the business. That means a worker within in the job for six months will only have three or four page seven sick days available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And because the hours that can roll over from year to year is limited, workers will have to max out about two weeks they leave. Those days are essential under normal circumstances, but I don't believe they're sufficient under the coronavirus crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that this should be used as an opportunity also to highlight the need for working people to fight for guaranteed paid leave, both locally and nationally, and also the fact that, you know, businesses should be urged right now, the businesses that do remain open within the state mandated requirements that they should be urged to guarantee'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I know there's a lot more that much of us that was working on to try to address in light of the desire to make some amendments to the second safe leave legislation. For a long time, this is the tip of the iceberg and we'll continue those efforts.'",
