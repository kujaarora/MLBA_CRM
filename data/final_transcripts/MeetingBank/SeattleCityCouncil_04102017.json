        "'speaker_0': 'And when you do come come down here to express your opinion, we do welcome that. But again, if you do get a chance to speak, I do apologize. Please call the first. Such an item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The report of the full council agenda item one Constable 118 940 relating to land use and zoning amending the official land use map to reason certain land in downtown South Lake Union and adjacent see zones.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President Harold. So we have the mandatory housing affordability legislation in front of us today that will enact these changes in downtown in South Lake Union. I want to talk for a minute about how we got to this point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council established a voluntary incentive zoning program in 2001 and several years ago began discussing changes about how we could produce more affordable housing. And Councilmember O'Brien was a leader in that discussion. I want to thank him for that work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Following on that, the Council adopted a resolution in 2014 that talked about our set of objectives associated with the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda. And one of the most critical components of that was the agreement to make changes to our voluntary program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our voluntary program was working, but we recognized that it wasn't enough to get us to the affordable housing targets that we had. So we set a set of targets, 6000 new units in the next ten years. And we built out a framework that is what we're adopting today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're in the downtown and South Lake neighborhoods. Over the next ten years, we are set out to build 2100 units of affordable housing, both in downtown South Lake Union and in other parts of the city. This is the equivalent of the 2016 housing levy that voters adopted last August.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a significant investment in affordable housing in our city and amounts to one third of the target of affordable housing units we want to develop in the next ten years. There's a couple of critical differences between our voluntary program and this mandatory program that we would adopt today, I hope.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first is that the mandatory program is just that it's mandatory. The voluntary program only applied to a certain percentage of new development capacity above the base development that existed in the city. This program applies to all new development and also does not eliminate the incentive zoning program, but also requires incentive zoning to stay in effect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So an instance, we're asking developers to participate in both of those programs, the incentive program and the mandatory program. The program performance and payment requirements are required on the entirety of the building, and it has a deeper level of affordability that as many folks mentioned during public testimony.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're focused in this program, folks making 60% of area median income. That's an individual making about 35 or $40,000 a year or a family of four making about $55,000 a year as a fifth generation Seattle. I've watched a lot of my cousins and relatives who are working in tech or working in finance be able to continue to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'afford to live in the city. But my little cousins, like me, who worked in the nonprofit sector before this or working in an education system, are continuing to be priced out. This program is intended to generate income restricted units for 75 years, targeted at our population, a population that has not been served by the incentive zone program'",
        "'speaker_1': 'or is or served by the lot of the investments that we make with our offers of housing, housing levy dollars. I know that there are a lot of concerns that have been addressed today about the program amounts. 75% of the neighborhoods in downtown and Salt Lake Union are going to pay 4% or more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a couple of neighborhoods that are around the 2% area. There's a lot of concerns from we've heard expressed from the community about trying to incentivize more residential buildings downtown. We believe that the set aside for in particularly those two little sections of downtown that are in the 2.1 or 2.9%, we'll do a lot to incentivize more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'residential development in those neighborhoods, whereas if we change the fees dramatically in those neighborhoods, it would incentivize the market to build more commercial development as opposed to housing. And those housing developments is what we've heard from Belltown, from downtown residents that they want to see more of in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the legislation, if we don't get it right, we've got an opportunity here in June of 2018 to come back around and take a look at those numbers and revise them. But I've also heard from a lot of folks that the numbers in San Francisco or New York or Boston and other places are higher.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you take a look at those programs. Those programs are not as broad geographically as the program that we're hoping to implement as part of our citywide zoning changes next year. They offer oftentimes a much larger zone capacity increase than what a lot of neighborhoods that I talked to would be interested in accepting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when you actually go look on the ground where they're not building the affordable housing, they're oftentimes seen as an impediment to construction of affordable housing. Ask any activist in the San Francisco neighborhood if they're 15 to 25% requirements or building the affordable housing that they're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the answer is no. So I believe that this is a really important first start for us today. We've got four amendments that we're going to consider. But I wanted to lead off with our opening statements and then happy to answer questions that will get into the details of the amendments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Johnson there any questions? We'll move into some amendments and any questions for my colleagues. I don't see any hands flying up. So why don't you take us through the First Amendment you have?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. So amendment number one is an amendment that adds findings of fact to the request of. A lot of parliament to the bill. These findings generally document the city's process and how we've met the requirements in the revised code of Washington.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And generally they recite the background and history reference the framework legislation that we adopted last summer to establish these programs and describe the city's policy basis for the reason and implementation of the program. So I'd encourage my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment and would move for its adoption.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's been second, it has been moved in second. And the First Amendment that comes from Johnson described it anywhere. Any question about the First Amendment, all those in favor of the amendment as described. But I, I opposed and have it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have that First Amendment comes from Johnson. Like to move us through the second one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, sir. The Second Amendment is something that's unanimously supported by councilmembers Herbold, O'Brien and myself. It relates to two issues that we heard a lot from community during the course of public testimony on this topic. The first is family size units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We heard a lot from a growing population of families that are living in downtown and South Lake Union in Belltown, that they like to see the construction of much more affordable housing for families. The market isn't building that housing right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've got a very small percentage of the marketplace that is building two bedroom units or larger. So this allows this amendment would allow additional height above the maximum height limits. If a building is building ten family sized units, units with three bedrooms or more, that would be included in the development and that would also have access to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'accessible outdoor space, which is a critical thing for a lot of families living downtown. The second element of this amendment is to implement a residential transportation management program. Our city requires the developers of commercial buildings to work with the folks in the building to reduce the number of drive alone folks in the building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This amendment would ask residential buildings to do the same and incentivize those developments to do things like build in car, share parking spaces inside the development, work with their residents for all the cards and distribution of other ways that we can incentivize folks who are living in those buildings to get out of their cars and live car'",
        "'speaker_1': 'less or car free. These two elements are really consistent with the policy objectives that we heard during the course of our outreach and public testimony. Again, they're supported by all the members of the committee, and I urge my colleagues adoption of amendment to and would move for its adoption.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. There is a second. It has been second. So I'll refer to the Second Amendment as the Second Amendment relative to family size units and transportation management programs. All those in favor of Amendment two. Say I. I opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The ayes have it. So we have a Third Amendment. And I think Councilmember Herbold will present that. Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Amendment three A would require that the Office of Planning and Community Development and the Seattle Department of Construction, INS and Inspections, in consultation with the Construction Codes Advisory Board report to the Council by September 30th, 2017 on the use of lot sub areas for the purposes of the application of development standards in the light land'",
        "'speaker_9': 'use code. The purpose of this amendment is to address a concerns that were raised by a change that council made recently in the SDI, the Seattle Department Construction Inspections Omnibus Bill as relates specifically to assumed lot size. We had played earlier with the idea of striking the assumed lot language from this bill, but determined that it would'",
        "'speaker_9': 'not actually affect the the change that was desired. And so for that reason, we worked with SDI and adjusted the amendment based on their suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to second that amendment has been moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And second, Councilmember Herbold amendment regarding the assumed lot reporting requirements. All those in favor of the amendment vote i. I oppose. The ayes have it. The Third Amendment has passed. We have a Fourth Amendment. Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So the underlying policy purpose of this amendment is threefold to one, to have a consistent policy approach for the MHRA program across the entire city, to use that consistent policy approach to realize a modest increase in affordable housing fees and thus leverage significant additional housing dollars from other funders.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And also to address a political criticism of the MHRA program that property owners and developers in South Lake Union in downtown a high cost area, should not have a lesser requirement from property owners and developers elsewhere in the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In doing so, I believe this will help us as well in our future city wide MHRA program deliberations recently in the University District and proposed in the future for all citywide MHRA reasons. The MHRA program proposes to capture a portion of the value conveyed through the increase in development capacity based on a target level of performance in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the form of an affordable housing obligation placed on developers. This is not the approach proposed for the South Lake Union and Downtown MH, a R program for MHR in South Lake Union. In Downtown, the grand bargain proposes to base MHR affordable housing obligations on a 2013 formula for an incentive zoning program that at the time, also like'",
        "'speaker_9': 'we proposed to do today, was not based upon the value of the upper zones made much larger up zones, much larger up zones. In that case, in 2013, the city could have adopted a program that would have required 20% of units at 80% of AMI, and developers would have still had a 6.8% return on investment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ultimately, the Council went with the option that the Council went with only required 5% of units at 80% of r of of a rate of return with of 9.2%. I don't propose to correct that decision from 2013. With my amendment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I only propose that we do not compound the issue by also failing to base our MHRA affordable housing obligations on the value of the 10 to 50 foot up zones. We granted today's actions. Some argue we have an obligation to make this exception in South Lake Union because of an agreement made in 2015, the grand bargain.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'An agreement to do an agreement to which neither the public nor this council was a party. Yet even within the grand bargain, it says it's understood that during the course of conducting the necessary analysis and drafting of legislation, some of the terms may be modified.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But now we're told we don't mean those terms, the terms about size of the affordable housing obligations. Someone said to me rhetorically this weekend, why even have a city council if the mayor major policy issues in this law are essentially settled in a non legislative process?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For this reason I worked with city central staff to identify an option that bases the payment and performance requirements on the value of the proposed 2017 up zones of 10 to 50 feet. The amendment would.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Apply a fat flat.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Payment requirement of $14.75 and a performance requirement of 5% across all zones. The operative assumptions of this amendment are a 5% vacancy rate, a 5.25% capitalization rate. Assumed rent of $3.04 per square foot. These assumptions are very conservative, according to Dupree and Scott, for buildings built since 2010 and downtown in South Lake Union.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The average vacancy rate is 4%. The current cap rates are approximately 4% and the average rent is.'",
        "'speaker_8': '$3.25 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This modest increase in payment and performance requirements helps us to further address our affordable housing crisis and use the private investment of developers to leverage significant additional affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dollars, all while.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Providing an economic incentive for developers. Remember that for every $1 we get from private developers, we leverage other housing resources. Over 20 years, it would generate approximately 1.3 million more each year, and developer fees that could be matched with matching dollars equaling as much as a total of 3.9 million more each year, or approximately 350 units over'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the course of 20 years. This amendment also ensures a more consistent policy framework across the entire MSA affordable housing program so that we can tell the public that in all places the program applies. We are considering the value of the additional development capacity that the city is granting and turning it into affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He get?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold has made a motion relative to the performance and payment requirements just to keep it alive. Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's been moved in second. We have a live amendment on for Councilmember Johnson. Would you like to have the microphone?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, sir. Thank you very much. Councilmember Herbold and I have had a lot of really good discussions about a whole lot of different topics. And this among them, I think, has been some of our most fruitful. You know, I am going to ask my colleagues, as you know, Councilmember Herbold, to vote against this amendment for a couple'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of reasons. The first of which is, I think that we have an obligation as set up in the framework to try to meet that goal of 6000 units of affordable housing as presented. What has been sent to us as part of an overall goal and objective that we believe is going to generate 2100 units of affordable housing'",
        "'speaker_1': '? I don't believe that we've had the time and energy to really rigorously analyze that 5% requirement and the impact that it may have on the near-term actions of affordable housing, as I mentioned before. There's a couple of instances where we think that flip to 5% would have a negative impact on the building of residential and may result'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in a flip to commercial, which may make it difficult for us to see more housing, particularly in downtown and south of Canyon. The second is, you know, I think one of my primary goals for this program is to capitalize on what some have called sort of the fourth quarter of development that we're in right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a lot of folks that I talked to when I'm out at the farmer's market that are saying, how come it's taken us so long to get to this point? How come we haven't implemented this mandatory housing affordability program right now while we're in such a boom time for the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And my objective here is to try to set the rates in such a way that we make sure that we maximize the investments in affordable housing. But we also find a way to get developers that are already grandfathered in under the current zoning changes to opt in to this program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I get concerned that if we don't set the numbers at the right level, we won't see those developers 20, 30, 40, 50 or so that are already currently in the permitting pipeline that aren't required to build any affordable housing that if we set the numbers too high, they will not build any affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe that the numbers that we've set as part of this legislation give us the best opportunity to have development that's currently in the pipeline, opt in, and that those developers are going to generate millions, if not tens of millions of dollars that we can use today to build affordable housing today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe that those affordable housing units that we need today are better than the ones that we may that may result in the future if we got if we got your amendment adopted. I, I also just want to say I really appreciate the thoughtfulness and approach that you've taken to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the things I've really enjoyed about working with you is you have a very data driven approach, but we also have a nice way to talk to each other without ever making this about personal rhetoric or personal attacks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really, really welcome that. This is a policy debate there. As someone said in public comment, there are lots of different ways you can come to different conclusions. I really respect the work that you've done on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just have come to a different conclusion and ask my colleagues to vote no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Work hard for that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Johnson. Would any of my colleagues like to make any make any comments before we vote? Okay, so we have a amendment on the performance and payment request, excuse me, by Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Swan. Oh, I'm sorry. It comes from Russia. I didn't see that. Thank you. Has the floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate Councilmember Hubbell's comments. We live in a region where the two richest people in the world live side by side with thousands of people who have no homes at all. And we live in a city that is growing wealthier by the week as working people keep getting pushed out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be farcical if it was not such a tragedy. And the response from the mayor and the majority of the council, frankly, could not fall farther short of the real needs of the situation. And that is no accident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mayor invited for profit developers into his hall committee and gave them a veto over any recommendation. So the mayor saw the measures that could make any real difference, like fighting for rent control were not allowed to see the light of day in the so-called grand bargain.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today's discussion on the mandatory housing affordability in Salt Lake Union and downtown epitomizes that inadequacy in the neighborhoods where property owners and developers are making the most profit. Where affordable housing is becoming an endangered species. The current proposal legislation would require less affordable housing than anywhere else in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as Councilmember Herbold points out, perhaps even less so than the status quo. The current proposal to only require 2.1% affordability for development along the waterfront is pitiful. After taxpayers, after taxpayers spend hundreds of millions to beautify the waterfront park and billions to move the viaduct underground, all to elevate property values.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are then requiring only 2.1% affordable housing in what is sure to become some of the most valuable real estate in the city and a windfall for some very lucky people. That is the power that big business has in City Hall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They take literally billions of dollars of our tax money, give us back a handful of affordable units, and the politicians expect us to thank them. I want to be clear. I want every affordable housing unit possible and we should get the units today that today's legislation will produce.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we cannot treat it like it's anywhere near sufficient. Councilmember Johnson said that we don't know what the negative aspects of increasing the affordability to 5% will be. I can tell you I'm not a real estate economist, but I am an economist and I think it is somewhat of a voodoo economics thing to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it's going to create some negative impact on. And on and on the other side. There is no suspense about the negative effects of the lack of affordability. We are living that every single day. At the very least, council members should support Councilmember Herbold amendment to increase that 2.1% to 5% affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That also, as many of you have said, is not enough. But it is more affordable housing and we should fight for every unit that is available. I will vote yes on this amendment. I join all my fellow activists in condemning the sweeps of our homeless community members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I urge that our movement hold elected officials accountable, remember their votes on affordable housing when they come back to campaign for their reelections. And I thank all the small business owners who also support increasing affordability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Swann. Are there any other comments from any of my colleagues before we take it to a vote? Okay. Hang. We have an amendment on the table. All those in favor of Councilmember Herbert's amendment vote. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And raise your hand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those opposed. Vote no and raise your hands now. So the amendment fails. So we still have a bill that's been amended three times. Are there any comments about the amended bill as a whole?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Johnson, if I may just take us on briefly. I just want to say a couple of quick things about the bill. You know, we have set a goal in the city of reducing our carbon footprint and being carbon neutral by 2050.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the best ways we can do that is by building dense housing, by our jobcentres building denser housing, particularly income, restricted dense housing by our transit centers and in job centers like downtown. And so that is one of the best things that we can do to reduce our environmental footprint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a goal of building out more family size units in this city in particular. This legislation took a really strong look at that and provided a lot more opportunities for us to build more family size units in downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This legislation helped to end decades of infighting between the labor community, the business community, affordable housing community and for profit housing community in a way that's going to result in 6000 units of income, restricted, affordable housing all throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We know study after study has shown that income restricted, affordable housing is one of the best tools we can use to reduce gentrification and keep of city more affordable. This program has a deeper level of affordability than any other program that we've adopted in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At 60% of area median income, this provides a significant amount of affordable housing for those folks who are increasingly being priced out of the city. And finally, I want to say how much I appreciate the fact that there are so many folks that are developments that are in the pipeline right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to call on those developers to work collaboratively with my office and with the rest of the city to opt in to this program and generate millions, if not tens of millions of dollars today for the affordable housing that we know we need today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Johnson, I believe Councilmember Burgess would like to say some more.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I want to thank Councilmember Johnson for the thorough work. I'm not on your committee, but I've read all of the briefing memos from central staff and from you and from Councilmember Herbold. So thank you. I also want to just remind ourselves that this legislation that we're about to pass today really does set the city on'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a new path and a new course of requiring all construction in the city, whether it's commercial or residential, to contribute to affordable housing. We've never had a mandatory program like this that will soon be adopted citywide. And the the the other the other issue that I think is important is that the individuals who have negotiated with the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'council and the mayor over the last couple of years are not the nefarious individuals that have been described. So, for example, many of our nonprofit housing developers in the city, like the Housing Development Consortium, campus housing, Capitol Hill Housing Bellwether, Plymouth Housing Interim Community Development Association, these are the folks that are actually building affordable housing in our'",
        "'speaker_10': 'city, and they stand in strong support of this legislation. And so so do labor unions in our city. We had the executive director of the King County Labor Council here today testifying in favor of this legislation. I know there's other labor reps who are still present with us this afternoon and then organizations like Sightline and the Urbanist'",
        "'speaker_10': 'who cover these kind of issues. Again, very supportive of where this legislation is going. And I think Mayor Murray and the council and all of Seattle can be proud of this legislation that we're going to adopt today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Before we call on the vote, I sure want to give a housekeeping item. We're going to vote on the amended legislation. And then unless there's objection, it's been brought to my attention that one of the reasons why we're hearing a lot of testimony about the sweeps and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What just mean regarding sweeps is because is there some action tomorrow that affects some people, I think even in this room. So what I'm going to propose after this piece of legislation is that we hear from three people that I believe are here that either live under the bridge in West Seattle or some areas around them and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'asked that they come. So I'm going to hold just a short public testimony just on that issue. If you are a resident or it affects you so we can hear from you for the action tomorrow. George. Scroll up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our person that we've asked to be in charge for the city on this issue has suggested this as well. And we want to make sure we hear from them. So we're going to vote. And then I'm just going to entertain some public testimony.'",
