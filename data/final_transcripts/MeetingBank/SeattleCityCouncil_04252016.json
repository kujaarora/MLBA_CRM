        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President before us this afternoon is Council Bill 118663. It is a piece of legislation that went through the Gender Equity Safe Communities Annual Americans Committee, and its purpose was to provide some legal clarity and a law that would prevent open air tour vehicles from both providing narrating while driving from the same person.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we we've had a one meeting, two meetings to discuss the particular policy issues that were proposed in this Council bill. We have several amendments that we have made to the open air tour vehicles, legislation to narrow it in specific ways, to address the specific issues related to distracted driving and dangers related to tour vehicles and guiding'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. There's no need for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a mirror.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So this legislation, the correct version in front of us, modifies what was originally submitted to the council. It narrows the scope of application to open air vehicles. It limits the size of the vehicle to vehicles carrying 16 or more persons, including passenger and the driver or staff members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It broadens the legislation to cover any vehicle that's operating on city streets, whether or not the tour begins or ends in the city. It broadens the definition of the prohibited activities to include tours near narration or entertainment while driving and operating on city streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It imposes either criminal or civil penalties, including the possibility of the issuance of citations, much like moving traffic citations. And then perhaps very significantly, it shifts the responsibility from the driver to the tour operating company that is penalized if there's a violation as opposed to the driver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Burgess, are there any further comments about this legislation?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just if I could add to that in terms of input that we got from community, we we heard from many different folks who own tour tour vehicles. Many of the operators within the city of Seattle who already operate open air vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had no objection to this policy direction. They, in fact, are already in many ways following the high safety procedures by having one person do the narration and one person do the driving. And so we we I want to thank those folks who came to both of our public hearings to provide us with public testimony about how this'",

We know we want it to be inclusive of those small businesses or medium sized businesses that run these. But we've had some tragedies here which really warrants our legislators getting on top of these issues.'",

Back when the voters of Seattle authorized shifting to a hybrid system where seven members are elected by district and two members elected at large, we asked the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'city auditor to look at other cities similar to Seattle to see how they handled their hybrid council system. And we did that in collaboration with the initiatives, sponsors and various city departments. We looked at Austin, Boston, Denver, Jacksonville, Oakland and San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'None of these cities have more than three staff members for their council members, and none of these cities provide money for in district offices. I certainly understand my colleagues desire to have an increased level of service to constituents, but I question whether an additional staff member is needed to do that work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My other concern comes from my role as budget chair. This decision is not made in a financial vacuum. There are costs associated with this. The fiscal note attached to this piece of legislation does not include this number, but we will soon, in my committee be asked to act on legislation that authorizes these expenses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And on an annualized basis, we're talking about a half a million dollars. Is this the highest and best use of these funds?

        "'speaker_2': 'And there's a reason why over 45,000 people helped put this on the ballot. And why did they do that? Because they believe that the people that should represent you should live with you and should be responsible for you.'",

Because the people of Seattle felt that they wanted representation, fair share of resources regarding parks, community centers, libraries, public safety, human services, pedestrian improvements and'",

And I'd like to also thank the people that are elected at large. That would be our mayor, Councilmember Gonzalez, and of major councilmember.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Being a new councilperson, I should add that 47 of the 50th largest cities in the United States already elect council members in geographic districts. And I think it's important to note that Seattle is a big city with big city problems, and we've also had major successes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The district system works. We just came up on our first 100 days less than two weeks ago. And I can say as a new councilwoman, these are some of the issues that I've been struggling with in dealing with and reading about and learning about and working in relying on my fellow council members.'",

So as a woman, as a mother, as a person that has lived in my district in the North End for 30 years, 25 years in my district where I raised my children, where I bought my home, where I rented my house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I didn't live in the North End because I was a Republican or a Democrat. I lived in the North End because I had good schools, had infrastructure and had transit, and I felt that it was time to have the North End represented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's why I decided to run. But more importantly, it's because I believe in this great city and I believe in how progressive we are and I believe how humane we are. Thank you.'",

We're 39 in 2015 and 16, we're at 41. And I say that to look at the numbers, to suggest that many council members, through the use of temporary employees, through the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'use of work study employees, many, many council members have had three or four, sometimes five employees in their office. And what this change does, it's an administrative change to simply. Codify sort of a practice that has occurred even without this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would remind my colleagues that you are not required to hire anyone. You are not required to use your budget. And so this gives the council members a choice, some flexibility. And those that choose not to use it certainly will have that choice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I, I applaud Councilmember Burgess for reminding us once again that we are stewards of the public public funds, the public tax based public moneys. But again, I think that while other cities there's some precedential value in what they do, it certainly is not controlling precedent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that I think that we can continue to be a leader in this country for what we do in terms of delivering constituent services. So, again, this is designed to give us flexibility. And I think my colleagues make those points.'",

Proponents of bias will now be required to submit a draft proposal to the city before circulating petitions for signatures.'",
