    "AN ORDINANCE relating to the Ethics Code; amending Sections 4.16.030 and 4.16.070 of the Seattle Municipal Code; requiring elected officials to disclose financial interests in legislative matters prior to participating in those matters; and creating a limited exception to the requirement that elected officials disqualify themselves from participating in such matters.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'The bill passed and Cheryl sign it. Please read the first agenda item and if the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee section.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To be part of the Governance Equity and Technology Committee and item one cancel 119 254 relating to the ethics code, the many sections for point 16.0 38.0 77 is for code requiring elected officials to disclose financial interests in legislative matters prior to participating in those matters and creating a limited exception to the requirement that elected officials disqualify'",
        "'speaker_6': 'themselves from participating. Such matters committee recommends the bill passed as amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, thank you very much. So this legislation was initiated by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission after our city council structure moved to a At-Large and district structure and currently under the ethics code. If a council member, of course shares a financial interest with a substantial segment of the city population, he or she does not need to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'disclose or recuse. But if that financial interest is not shared, he or she must recuse himself or herself from participate participate in voting. And with these changes presented by this new bill, basically there's a disclosure process if in fact there's a financial interest shared with a substantial segment of the population.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that sort of terminology becomes sort of critical, to be very candid, if a council member still has a direct financial interest in matters that are being legislated or discussed, of course he or she still has a conflict and there's a different mechanism that is recusal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in a situation where there is a it is shared with a substantial segment of the population, there is a sort of disclosure process that I will describe in a minute. There will be a slight amendment from Councilmember Herbold, 12 counts for her.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I go through the base legislation and will reserve some time for that. In addition, this new bill also applies to all elected officials, which now would include the mayor and the city attorney, whereas the previous ordinance just applied to council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what are those disclosures? If, in fact an elected official holds a financial interest with a substantial segment of the of the public? Hiroshima's post a written disclosure on the officials web page and file a copy. The Executive Director and the City Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Council member must additionally make a disclosure on public record at an open public meeting of the Council or one of the committees at which the Legislature led legislative matters discussed. The Council members shall also, before participating in that legislative matter at any subsequent Council Committee meetings, repeat the oral disclosure on the public record of that meeting'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We've actually started discussing this some time ago, back in 2016, in 2017. And so we try to work with the commission sort of to better understand both the the basis, the legal and factual basis for this legislation and make sure we weren't sort of overlooking any practical concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank the commissioners all for unanimously recommending this this legislation. And again, we want to air on the side of complete transparency. So that means repeated disclosures, making sure, again, a person since we were by district can have, if affected, can have district representation in critical legislative matters and still again weighing the need for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'transparency with having representation in a particular district. I'll tell you what, there might be a question to someone may say, but at this point, I'm going to suspend the rules to allow councilman or herbal to present a an amendment, which I don't think is controversial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we could have some discussion about the base amendment to have to make a formal motion. And can I just exercise my authority? Okay. By unanimous consent hopefully of for no one stands up and hollers by unanimous unanimous consent and no objection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to suspend the rules now and allow Councilor Herbold to present an amendment which I was chastised for doing things that the ladies are. And let's see if we're going to chastise her as the way you did me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The way the record did, that I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Assume you have the floor it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is owed me and I will take it. Thank you. Thank you, Council President, for allowing me to speak to this proposed amendment to the the rest of the amendments that are before the Council. This is, I think, neither strict in conflict with what has come out of committee, nor is it prescriptive to to the commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the elements coming out of the legislation voted by the committee before us now is to ask that the Ethics and Election Commission develop a rule. And the rule relates specifically to what a substantial segment of the public is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my amendment only app asks the Commission to consider whether or not the rule should. Include a distinction of whether or not the elected official is elected by district or citywide. It doesn't require them to make a distinction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It just ask them to consider whether or not there should be a distinction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that amendment. I certainly support it. Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, this is just for the amendment that for the base legislation. Any other questions about Councilman Herbold amendment? And thank you for bringing that concern back show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So, first of all, I just want to say.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know we are trying very hard to get these things in early. I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Getting this at 215 on the same day that we're supposed to be voting on, it doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Qualify as especially when we've been working on it for about four years now. But that said, considering that you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Councilmember Gonzalez both live in District one as an example, hypothetically speaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How would you think the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rule would apply and impact the two of you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Differently? What are you looking for?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The rule hasn't been developed. I'm simply asking the Commission in its development of the rule to consider whether or not there should be a difference. I don't know the answer to that question. I'm just asking. They are the experts and they are they're going to be the ones who are developing the rule.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just flagging this as as an issue for them to consider in their rule development. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll just say that nothing in the amendment that Councilmember Herbold is advancing or the underlying legislation would actually resolve.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The conflict of interest that I've.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Identified in terms of my direct or your soundtrack's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Financial interests with regard to the sound transit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Preferred.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Preferred alternative identified by the Stakeholder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Advisory Group.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Which is right on top of my condo. So these rules are going to I'm still going to be completely conflicted out and will not see any really through. So there is no impact for me as an elected official making decisions in that other space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great. Thank you. And I just want to underscore, I was not thinking specifically of that incident. I was just thinking that both of you are in district one. And how would this be impactful for the two of you just going forward and let's just say your condo issue is off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is is not an issue. I mean, I'm I'm I'm at large representative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think the formula and calculation of the conflict would have to be evaluated through that at large months of substantially substantial number of people across the city would have to be benefiting it. I just happen to live in District one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we're just going to vote on the amendment. Any other questions on just the amendment? All those in favor of Councilmember Herbold amendment s8+. Please vote i. I opposed. Okay, so the base legislation is amended. Would any councilmembers like to comment on the base legislation before we take a vote?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I'll just be. Thank you. I want to say thanks to my colleagues. We have actually been working on this since 2013.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the first time I am here appeared in front of the Ethics Commission was the summer of 2013.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, Councilmember Gonzales was on the commission at that time and very much appreciate the fact that we've been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going through this with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Great care. Wayne Barnett's here. Appreciate how hard that that office has been working for me. It's really about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Being able to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Represent the constituents in District seven. Initially, when I was told I could not be involved, I've had to recuse myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As all of you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This waterfront project is something I've been working on since.'",
        "'speaker_1': '2004 in different.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Capacities, and I look forward to being able to come back and meet with my constituents here again, their concerns and make decisions with the rest of you. So thank you today for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All of your work on it. Council President Hiro leading the group and the government subcommittee and I appreciate going forward today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I'm going to be voting against this today, but I want to just speak briefly. Why? I also want to state my appreciation for the work that's been done in the last few weeks to really narrowly tailor this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that makes this much harder decision for me. I understand the desire of the commission to be able to focus on this unique circumstances we now have because we have district council members. And I think that that's a valid concern that is being weighed against what I think is our existing ethics in elections code, which'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is, I believe, one of the best in the country. And for me, that tradeoff is just not quite enough to support this right now. I understand why. And I think that reasonable minds I certainly understand why folks would support it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But for me, my preference would be to leave things as they are. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Bryant. Any other comments or concerns? Councilwoman Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just briefly, I want to say that in contrast to Councilmember O'Brien actually will be voting yesterday. I was opposed to the approach as it was originally proposed in 2016 when I first started on the council. That was because I thought that it was written a little too broadly in the instance of potential future conflicts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I live just outside a urban village in Roosevelt Ravine, a neighborhood. The way that that legislation was described to me in 2016 would have been that I would have still been allowed to vote on council matters that could potentially rezone my own property that seemed like too big of a conflict of interest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And in this instance, I would now still be prohibited from voting on the rezoning of my property, which I think many folks would perceive as an accurate conflict of interest, that I, as a councilmember, shouldn't be able to vote on changes to my own property values based on that particular conflict.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is more this more narrowly tailored approach is one that I can support, and we'll be voting yes today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Okay. I think we're cancer. I'm a skater.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the amendments that have been put forward. Thank you to Wayne and your team for trying to find a path forward. I, too, was concerned with some of the initial language that I saw.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Obviously, I think that we believe that any elected should not be lining their own pockets with any policy decision that's made and that there should not be a direct financial benefit for votes that are taken. I think a great example is the one that was just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If a rezoning decision were in front of us and that related to anybody's specific property and there was direct financial benefits, that would be a conflict that I would want to make sure somebody had had the requirement to recuse themselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Under this scenario, it appears that that is the case, and we have crafted this carefully. I think that it's important that we allow for folks to vote on policies that allow for us to act as good stewards of the public dollar and make good public policy decisions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For example, I want everybody on this council to be able to make decisions about how we create new sidewalks for people to walk carefully to school or to work. I want to be able to have this entire council be able to vote on up zones so that we can create more density and the opportunity to live in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this city. Those are two examples of ways that we improve the quality of life for all Seattle and don't have a direct benefit to any one individual, though it may be a direct benefit to a region or certain portion of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not a direct financial lining of anybody's pocket. So I think that this is a good compromise. Thank you to Wayne again and your team and to the council members that have put this forward. I'll be supporting this version.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilmember skater. Okay, I think we're ready to vote, so let's do that. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilmember Swatch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Rosen Herald. I respect Councilmember O'Brien's concerns, but I think if there is full disclosure, then that is the important thing and I think that remains existing here. I will be voting yes on it. I also wanted to just note that ultimately the biggest financial impact on council members and our politicians in general is the campaign'",
        "'speaker_2': 'donations they get from big business, which is still going to be allowed. So I think that that's the essential point. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yes. Matt Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I just wanted to take a moment to speak to the base Bill, if I could. When we originally started deliberating on this piece of legislation, I turned to the Ethics and Elections website where it says that the code seeks to prevent conflicts of interest.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In other words, the objective is not to make conflicts known to the public, but instead is to try to ensure that they don't occur at all. A financial interest in itself is not a conflict of interest. And that's why by asking the Ethics and Elections Commission to, through its rulemaking process, determine what a substantial segment of the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'public is, we are still maintaining that bright line in prohibiting conflicts of interests, because we are we are giving them the ability to to determine when a financial interest is held by primarily the council member or a small number of folks, and whether or not that really meets that that standard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So given the pivoting of this legislation, more again towards the the the the bright line that we've had for a very long time and has benefited us in the city, I am going to support the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Herbold. Okay. I believe we are now ready. Councilmember, anyone change your mind? Could do a nine. And over here I got nine and I'll kick in here for you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Keep it interesting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So on I make sure. By Gonzales. I Herbold II. Johnson Suarez. Mr. O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President Herrell. All right. Eight in favor.'",

I do believe that this is the appropriate next step for council to take after about ten years of consideration on this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the Council first passed its first ordinance establishing the Waterfront Partnership Committee in 2009 and adopted its first resolution affirming the concept of a lid back in 2012. Again, in 2017, we passed a resolution affirming that we would consider the lid as part of the funding of the waterfront improvement plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, this resolution does not form the lid and is consistent with the steps we have taken to evaluate the funding and execution of the waterfront redevelopment, a project that will total just under $4 billion when completed.

        "'speaker_3': 'disrespectful and making it sound that you're commit or that you are, that the lid imposed on you was such a small part or would not impact your lives. This is a project that has five major components that adds up to $4.7 billion.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And he said, You've probably heard from many of my neighbors on this issue, and I find their concerns thoughtful and worth considering. However, I do think it's fair to assume that those living downtown incur a disproportionate benefit from the waterfront improvements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I do think this project is likely to be an important and valuable addition to both our city and the surrounding neighborhoods property values. And the idea seems like a fair mechanism for an important project. I think we've demonstrated a willingness to really work with folks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Given the 20 year potential payback period associated with this. I think that the property assessments that I've seen so far have been a fair assessment, especially considering that many of the places that I've seen are valued have seen double digit assessment increases in the last 30 to 60 days alone.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I've seen properties downtown that have improved in value between 20 and $40,000 just in the last couple of months. And so for an average assessment of our median assessment of 20 $400, and for those that I know are going to be paying larger assessments, I think it's a fair approach.'",

The ability for low income folks and for seniors to get deferments from those investments. And frankly, I think that the benefits for this project will be seen citywide, which is why we've asked the broader city city residents to pay'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just wanted to, but I know I said I just want to say make sure it's clear that we do have deferral programs in place. And we do we are addressing displacement issues, low income seniors, retirees, nonprofit organizations, and then, of course, a 20 year deferral period in which to pay that.'",

And then further, when it comes to to administering the program and having oversight of the construction, that that's going to be led by by that office, not by by our staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's less of a of a concern about the the abilities of ESTA in a vacuum, but more about compounded complex capital projects that one department might have responsibility for. So I feel like those concerns have been addressed.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So the oversight piece is very important. I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for raising that question and also focusing in on that fourth option that we eventually are going to propose. In fact, when we look at nonprofits and we look at social services and who is deferred from that on, who is exempt from that, if you will'",

I also want to thank the chair for her good work to shepherd the last few conversations through and again echo with Council President Harold just mentioned that this seems to be the beginning of a process that has already been going on for about two years, three, ten years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A reminder to some of the folks who have been raising concerns and we talked about this a little bit at the last committee meeting that this many of the comments are directed at this council. But if we look over the last ten year period, it's the multiple mayors that initially initiated six mayors that initiated this process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, well, many questions have been raised about fiscal management and this council. And I believe the departments are working very hard to show how effective some of these dollars have been in both putting public dollars to good public use and being effective stewards of those public dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that it's a good reminder to to reflect back on this process being a ten year process with six mayors at the helm, not this council specifically. I am, however, concerned, as I hear some of the testimony as well, about the direct impact on some folks who are living in the district or in the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And part of what I was interested in knowing more about is what alternative funding sources have been looked at. As I understand it, given that I'm the newest to this conversation. In reading the materials that have been presented to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It looks that commercial properties are absorbing over 87.4% of the litter assessment, leaving the remaining 12% to be absorbed by the residential condo owners in the area. I think that's an important number to continue to reflect on as we know that the improvements in the waterfront corridor will have a direct financial benefit to the business owners down'",
        "'speaker_6': 'there. And I think that it is right that they absorb the vast majority of this cost. I also am concerned, though, as I hear about what the total assessment could be on some of the homeowners or condo owners in the area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I asked for a breakdown of what it would be for the one time assessment, the median one time assessment of 20 $400 a year, which could be paid over 20 years, breaks down to about $119 per year or just under $10 a month.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these are some of these statistics that I think are important to get out there. And I think when we have conversations over the next six week having a better assessment from individuals in the area of what the actual impact will be will be very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I look at the department to help us get a better understanding of those dollars and cents numbers so that we can have a true conversation with the community as this rolls out. Again, recognizing that this is just the beginning of a process, just the beginning of the end of a long process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also know that this is not the only funding source for this important, I would say, gateway to our city effort. We know that there has been significant investments put from all taxpayers throughout the city with a massive bond effort for this seawall replacement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know that every taxpayer in the city also helped with the redevelopment of the deep bore tunnel and relied primarily on gas and other taxes paid by everyone in the city and the region. We also know that there are essentially billions of dollars in the waterfront transformation paid by taxes to all spread across all community members in'",

And I think that the proposal that has been transmitted to us from the mayor, again, transmitted to us from the mayor with about 88% of the total lead assessment coming from commercial properties, absorbing the lit assessment seems to me a reasonable formula for'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Casper ROSQUETA, because we want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To thank you, Broken Arrow. A downtown lit is mathematically an overwhelmingly progressive source of funding for the waterfront park because the overwhelming majority of the expensive downtown property is owned by large businesses, hotels and real estate speculators. These are also the same entities that will most benefit financially from the waterfront park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, it needs to be registered. I think that this is in contrast to the usual process between the tunnel, all the utilities that are about to be moved to sea wall, the people, the other public moneys going to the waterfront park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think regular working class and middle class people across the city have already been asked to pay to. Much for the expensive costs of the downtown project. The bills so dramatically increase the property values of those wealthy owners of downtown real estate.'",

In King County, low income seniors have again be exempted from all property taxes. And if we know of seniors who are on fixed income, who are in the area, then you are probably eligible for this'",

Answer everyone's concerns. So I look forward to hearing from all of you over the next weeks and months as the process unfolds.'",

I will be voting yes on this resolution and I look forward to talking with you all about how to mitigate the impact on working class and middle class people who are caught'",
