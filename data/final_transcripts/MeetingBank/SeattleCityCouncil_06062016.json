He looked out for them while they were alive and when they died alone, and he was often there for them.'",

And what impressed me most is how many people just came up to him, even at that very late hour, thanked'",

Councilmember Juarez, I think mentioning Donnie's love of kids and some of those children growing up and helping and volunteering with him and others really makes renaming this park after Danny and his memory very fitting. I remember walking the international district with him.'",

And if we do end up one day in an in a dispute in the courtroom that Councilmember Sawant points to as as a place to talk about the legality of this of this law, I think'",
        "'speaker_1': 'our response needs to be to take this issue even further, less about repealing the ban on rent control, which I support. But there is a part of the law that exists today that says you are entitled to a refund of your rent, not a increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This this measure that that's before us right now is a very small thing to keep a landlord for raising the rent in the case of of of life safety violations. Tenants already are entitled to a reduction in their rent under the warranty of habitability.'",
