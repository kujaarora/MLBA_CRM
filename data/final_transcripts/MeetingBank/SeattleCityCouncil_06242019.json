Very quickly, Mr. President, maybe I'll save some of my thank you's for the end, but I just wanted to again underscore the importance of this document that sounds very wonky.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is like alphabet soup. But the reality is that this in combination with the public land disposition policy last year will allow for us to build more social housing, socially responsible housing, housing that's affordable and accessible for communities across Seattle.'",
