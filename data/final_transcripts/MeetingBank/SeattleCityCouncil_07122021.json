        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, Councilman Morales.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fine. Thank you, Chair Peterson. So as we discussed in the Transportation Committee, this resolution is to honor Clarence Cox Jr. For nearly 50 years, since 1971. He's helped develop the talents of hundreds of young people, young Seattle musicians, as director of the Garfield High School's internationally renowned jazz ensemble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He's been director of all band programs at Garfield and more recently was the founding educator at Seattle's Jay-Z program.

        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Morales gave such a nice introduction. I don't have much more to add, except that with all the incredible work that Clarence Cox did at Garfield High School, you'd think that would be enough. But instead, in 2010, he went on to launch Jay-Z with me and our co-founder, Sheree, Sheryl Hecker, to ensure that all students had access'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the life transforming opportunity of music education at Garfield High School, despite the diversity of the student population. If you're familiar with the program, the bands themselves do not reflect the population of the school. And his goal was to ensure that students across the city had access to music education.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so Jay-Z was launched in 2010. And now we serve over 1000 students with significant financial aid to a very diverse population of kids. And we are so excited by the opportunity to be able to honor Clarence in this very meaningful way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When we open our new building at the corner of Clarence, a Cox Wade.'",

I should have actually moved to suspend the rules to allow Laurie to actually address the council during the full council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my apologies that I did not do that in advance of hearing from Laurie. But we're all we've got that all done. And I didn't hear any objection to allowing Laurie to speak so retroactively. The rules are suspended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, that's okay, Laurie. Don't worry about it. I should have I should have managed this process a little bit, a little bit more. And I am sorry that I did not do that. But don't worry about it. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, colleagues, we are going to go ahead and hear any additional comments on the resolution from any other council members who may want to speak to it. Looking for raised hands. Any additional comments? Councilmember Peterson, is there anything else you'd want to add as the chair?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council president. This what? This resolution was recommended unanimously by our committee.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'It's the council president. Our Transportation and Utilities Committee unanimously recommended adoption of Resolution 32007, which is the updated strategic plan for Seattle City Life on June 16. The utility presented the plan to our committee. Then on July seven, our committee heard from the Seattle City Review panel about why they fully endorse a citywide strategic plan.'",

Despite several cost pressures, including the COVID pandemic, Seattle City Light has surpassed expectations in keeping their rate increases under control.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City Light also succeeded in not increasing the net utility bills of electricity customers this year when its customers were the most vulnerable. Moreover, City Lights proposed rate path will also have a lower than expected rate increase in the future as compared to the previous strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Net result is the six year average annual increase will be less than 3.5% instead of the original 4.5%. On June 16, our committee already saw this, so our committee unanimously endorsed this plan, as did the review panel. And so we recommend passage today.'",

However, when it lists a projection of the rate increases over the next six years, it does not say who should pay those rate increases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Since taking office, including as a previous chair of the City Council and Energy Committee, I have consistently argued that the wasted light divides up costs between big business and regular Seattle residents as very regressive city lights formula effectively charges Seattle residents almost twice as much per unit of electricity as it charges big business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Several years ago, my office proposed legislation to change that, but no other council member agreed. The utility does have a utility discount program for low income Seattle residents. But like all means tested programs and you need to apply for less than half of eligible people in Seattle are actually on the program.'",
