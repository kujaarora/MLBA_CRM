        "'speaker_4': 'geographic equity as a consideration in the distribution of of the grants. The reason that the coming round for the second grant is being put in in this amendment is because we do not have enough money in our funds to even serve all of the small businesses that I have applied to want to make sure that everyone has'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an opportunity to receive funds before people come for a second dip. So. Those are my comments. Council President and I appreciate the consideration.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'one conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we know that businesses who receive funding already in the first round.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Not going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Support this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will say that I fully support Amendment two are being offered by Councilmember Strauss, but I can't support Amendment one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Councilmember Morales, Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See here. I'm off mute. Great. So I have a question. You know, I heard loud and clear from when they started this small business stabilization fund that they're they're narrowing of the eligibility to five employees was their best way of ensuring that eligibility was narrowly focused on using an equity lens, narrowly focused on low and moderate income'",
        "'speaker_1': 'business owners in communities of color, and that in increasing the number of employees for businesses, it makes it a little bit more difficult for us to make decisions with that kind of equity lens. And we've already agreed to increase the eligibility from 5 to 10 employees for for eligibility.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I just want to see if the if the sponsor, Councilmember Strauss, has any information related to specifically the number of eligible businesses with this increase to to 25. My understanding is that already received 5500 eligible applications for the first round of funding, which was only available at that point to businesses with five or fewer employees'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And even though 5500 eligible applications were received, they were only able to make 250 grants. So I'm just wondering, do we have, again, estimates of the number of businesses that would be eligible and and then the number of of grants it would be possible to make with these new funds if we increase the eligibility to to 25'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I remember Strauss.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilmember Harold. I do have that information. I don't have it at the tip of my fingertips. So let me see if I can't find it and just send you an email. Right now, I know that you are correct that this would enlarge the pool of eligible businesses to a great degree, which is also why'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I brought the other two elements to this amendment about not being funded a second time and distribution across the city. I will just raise that. There's even with that distribution across the city, there is still going to be a focus on equity versus just spreading peanut butter across across a number of different businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let me try and find that email about the level of number of businesses that would be able to receive this funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions or comments on Amendment One? Okay. I'm not seeing any colleagues. I like Councilmember Morales, am also struggling with this amendment. I did oppose it in a version of it in committee last week. My position has not changed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that the points or the questions by Councilmember Herbold are, you know, my primary concern about increasing the amount. So it's important for us to you know, and I was in I worked with Councilmember Strauss on increasing it from 5 to 10.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was work that we did in partnership in order to sort of modulate where we, you know, sort of where we're setting the line for for the size of a small business at about five was probably too small.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten seemed a little bit more appropriate to really target in on those mom and pop main street shops that we really are hoping to be able to provide assistance to. My concern with opening it up to 25 FTE is it seems to me to be a pretty aggressive pendulum swing in the opposite direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, 25 of those could be up to 50 employees or maybe even more. And I worry that when we start getting into that number, that volume of employees, that we're no longer talking about a small business in the way that we intend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for that reason, I'm going to continue to oppose this particular amendment. I certainly appreciate the spirit and the intent with which it was brought forward. But but those issues have unfortunately not been resolved for me from my perspective and from the feedback that I've heard from some small business owners, particularly those small businesses who are owned'",
        "'speaker_0': 'by folks of color and or immigrants and refugees. So that being said, it sounds like we are ready to take a vote here. So I am going to ask the. I'm sorry. Councilmember Strauss, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just wanted to highlight. Thank you. Council president. Just wanted to highlight that we did work in partnership to make the initial change. And I and I appreciated being able to work with you on that. Just saying thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmembers Grass. I always appreciate working with you as well. Okay. So with that being said, let's go ahead and have the clerk re call the roll on the passage of Amendment one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lewis, I. MORALES No. Macheda. I. PETERSON.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse me. I'm sorry. So long.'",

I understand there is a Second Amendment also brought forward by Council Member Strauss, so I'm going to recognize you, Councilmember Strauss, in order for you to move the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President. Sorry, I'm just having some technical difficulties with these screens. Thank you for your time and thank you for the consideration. Colleagues on my amendments, I move to amend Council Bill 119812 as presented on an amendment to on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second? It's been moved and seconded to adopt amendment to. Councilmember Strauss, I'm going to hand it back over to you and recognize you in order to address amendments to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you don't mind. And there is a recently distributed version two of Amendment two that I just want to make sure was before the city council, before Councilmember Strauss addressed amendment number two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're saying that I need to suspend the rules?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'See. It's only a correction. It does not it does not change the facts of the amendment. It just corrects some technical numbers in the amendment. So it matters. It's all in line. And numbers try to see what it might addressing and whether she was able to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we don't. Madam Clerk, just so I'm clear on the procedure here, we don't need to amend the motion language that was just made by Councilmember Strauss. You just need him to, for the record, address what the changes are to the most recently distributed version of Amendment two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the bill has excuse me, the amendment has been moved and seconded. And so, Councilmember Strauss, again, I'm going to ask you to address Amendment two as it was recently circulated. So in doing so, if you could explain for the record what the difference is between the published version of Amendment two and the recently circulated version of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amendment two that would be required per our city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President. This the changes between what was just attached to the agenda and what was distributed is a simply. Let's see the updated amendment. And this is simply an admission to AIDS funding increase in Section four as reflected in the table and corrects the table y number to the column to reflect the added funding increase'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss. Would you like to make any other remarks or comments about Amendment two?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, thank you. Council president. This amendment would add $4.7 million to the to the funding for small businesses support. I came to this number because it would bring the total funding for small businesses support to 25% of the 2020 Jumpstart expenditures, a request that I've heard from small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And despite what some have said today, this does not run down our rainy day or emergency funds. To complete an additional $4.7 million means about 450 more small businesses in our communities will receive grants. That may be the difference between weathering this pandemic or closing down for good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I recognize that there is a concern with spending additional dollars out of the revenue stabilization fund, which is why this amendment is about half the size of the previous amendment that I brought last week. As with the other 2020 expenditures, if this amendment passes, I will be bringing an amendment to Resolution 31957 to replenish the Revenue Stabilization'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fund in 2021. We know that when small businesses stay open and keep employees, more people are able to spend money in our economy. This is exactly how and the importance of the middle class. When the middle class has the dollars to spend in the economy, it keeps activity moving as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More taxes are collected as these businesses stay open. I urge my colleagues to consider the crisis that small businesses are facing right now and allow us to scale our response to the stimulus package. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Strauss. Are there any comments or questions? Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. And I want to thank Councilmember Strauss for bringing this forward, as I did last week. I think that it is important that we talk about what we can do for the small businesses that are struggling throughout this crisis and trying to really make ends meet under really unique and extreme pressures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just think that given the amount of borrowing that we are doing from our emergency reserves, I am not in a position where I am going to vote to dig even deeper into the remaining amount of slack that we have capped into these reserve funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just given all of the other spending that we are committing to and knowing that next year we are going to have to rely on these reserves for a potential additional round of balancing and that preserving. What slack we do currently have in here is something that that I want to make sure that we maintain a commitment to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and not dig any deeper. The other thing that I would cite is, is it does look like we are going to get another round of community development block grant money in the in the near term, or at least the executive seems to be optimistic that we're going to get another round of community development block grant money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those funds have formed the core of our direct relief to small businesses. So we we have that potentially to look forward to to to come into this space. You know, I do think that part of our fall project in looking at the 2021 budget should include some discussion around some kind of tax relief for small businesses as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well. And I know Councilmember Strauss has been a leader on that. I think that those are the things that I would would prefer to focus on rather than continuing to draw down from our reserve funds. So I am going to going to respectfully vote against this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is hard to vote against it, but I do think that just based on how much we are currently spending or borrowing to be more accurate from our reserve funds, maintaining that the small amount of slack that we do have is is an important priority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for that reason, I'll be voting no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Any other questions or comments? Councilmember Peterson, followed by Councilmember Mosquito.'",
