        "'speaker_3': 'Agenda Item two Capital 119 840. An ordinance named in honor of my chance to run get terms relating to set up police department prohibiting law enforcement officers from questioning except in limited circumstances. Person 18 years of age or younger where a miranda warning is administered unless legal counsel is provided prohibiting law enforcement officers from quite requesting permission'",
        "'speaker_3': 'from a person under 18 years of age to conduct a search of a person or property, dwelling or vehicle under the person's control unless legal counsel is provided for that person. And a section 3.28. 174. A gentleman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Clerk, for reading that into the record. I will move to pass Council Bill 119840. Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded to pass the bill. Councilmember Morales, you are the prime sponsor of the bill. And I know several of us are are proud co-sponsors of this legislative efforts. So I'm going to go ahead and recognize you in order to address this item, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President. Thanks, everybody. I do want to begin by thanking the parents of my chance, Frank and Alexis, for joining us this morning and for calling to testify today in support of this bill and in honor of their son.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would certainly be an easier path for them to keep a lower profile and to grieve in isolation. But instead, they've made the intentional choice to do what they can to empower other youths to understand that they have rights and really to keep the honor and the legacy of my chance alive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Frank and Alexis, we mourn with you. And while we can't know your grief, we are grateful to know that the action we're taking today as a council can change the path of youth here in Seattle and inspire change in other places across the nation, as we've heard already.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My choice was a 17 year old high school senior from Des Moines who had dreams of going to law school and one day being a champion for the rights of young people. He was tragically shot in King County by the King County law enforcement in 2017 before he had a chance to realize those dreams.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm certain that if my chance was here today, he would be with us defending the rights of young people with regard to this ordinance. This bill establishes some safeguards for young people who are asked to waive their Miranda rights when detained by a police officer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The bill would protect children under 18 by ensuring that they consult with counsel prior to waiving their constitutional rights to interrogation or requesting requests for searches. The bill does include an exception that allows officers to interrogate children without counsel if they reasonably believe the information sought is necessary to protect life from imminent threat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Colleagues, we've heard before when when the community advocates and the public defenders were here at the beginning of August, we know that studies find that due to their continuing brain development, children may not have the mental capacity to make decisions that have serious long term impacts on their lives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That means that when youth are in a situation where they may be approached or questioned by a police officer, they may have a harder time asserting their constitutional right to silence and the right to refuse to be searched.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also know that children of color are disproportionately stopped by law enforcement and incarcerated in King County, 73.2% of children charged in 2018 were children of color. Between January and September of 2019, 86.5% of youth incarcerated were children of color.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to say that again in King County. Between January and September of 2019, 86.5% of youth incarcerated were children of color. I want to say for all of us that this is so much more than just a piece of legislation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is legal protection for young people and particularly for young people in my district who's a who's lived experience dictates that law enforcement does not necessarily have their best interests in mind. Many people have spoken about the lack of trust between young people, in particular in law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a recognition of the way that communities of color have been policed, particularly young black and brown men. Many people have spoken already about the the the need for protecting young people. I want to thank the folks who called in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did receive a memo in July from the King County prosecutor and from the sheriff's office, where they state that this proposal would further erode trust between juveniles and law enforcement and could lead to increased danger in the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As John Good has said and other callers have said, you can't erode what's not there. This ordinance is intended to help rebuild some trust by ensuring that young people have their rights protected and requiring that law enforcement assist them in seeking counsel before they are questioned.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do want to say that young people can choose to assert their autonomy after they've been provided legal counsel. They can still choose to speak to law enforcement if they want to. The difference is that we're demanding that they have their right to counsel, that that not be waived, that we recognize interactions with law enforcement are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'inherently coercive because of the power dynamics at play. So we want young people to have the information they need to make informed decisions that would inevitably impact their lives. The steps this council is taking would ensure that we protect our young people and that this would be the first of many pieces that we need to do to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'dismantle the racism that is embedded in our criminal legal system and stop the school to prison pipeline. As Councilmember Herbold mentioned this morning, this bill did pass and King County Council in their Law and Justice Committee by a41 vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to say King County Councilmember Jameis hello for his work in moving this at the county level. This bill will be heard tomorrow in the full King County Council. And I will also say that the county council's law department had no issues with the ordinance and were actually helpful in drafting it so that it could pass'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the county level. I'll have a closing remark, but I will stop there and I'm happy to take questions from our colleagues.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I've spoken numerous times about this bill. I really appreciate the partnership of Morales and in developing it. And the main thing I wanted to really make a point to add is to thank you, Council President Gonzalez, for allowing us to hear this on our full council agenda during a period of time where we are not'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It's just so important that we are able to honor his life with this critical reform that expresses our commitment to zero youth detention by recognizing that sometimes at the the first interactions with law enforcement, those are the actions that often begin the the the types of interactions that can result in, in detention and dramatically changing people's lives'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I also just want to finally, in closing, just recognize that I just think this is just. Common sense of of an approach. It is common sense to want to do everything that we can in our city to ensure that young people not only know what their rights are, they understand them, and they know how to act upon'",
        "'speaker_1': 'them. This is just really, I think, an important step that we as a council can take to show that we not only understand that there is a power imbalance between young people and law enforcement. We understand that there's reason for young people to not always trust those in power, particularly those in law enforcement, and that we want'",
