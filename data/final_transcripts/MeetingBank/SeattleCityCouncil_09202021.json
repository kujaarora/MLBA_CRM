        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you so much. Okay, folks, let's go ahead and end our period of public comment. We'll go ahead and go to other items of business on today's agenda, which is the public hearing on Council Bill 120157.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will the Court please read the title of Council Bill 1 to 0 157?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Constable 120157 relating to affordable housing on properties owned or controlled by religious organizations. Modifying affordability requirements adopted in ordinance 126334 and amended Section 23.40 2.005 of the settlements, the code and Section ten of Ordinance 2060 384.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It appears that technology is not our friend today. Just as we're about to do this. I see what Councilmember Strauss was having some need to reconnect. It looks like Councilmember Strauss is with us again. So before I open the public hearing on this item, I am going to go ahead and turn it over to Councilmember Strauss'",
        "'speaker_0': ', who is the sponsor of this bill. Councilmember Strauss will provide us with introductory remarks before we go ahead and hold the formal public hearing, for which we do have a handful of members of the viewing public registered to make public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you so much, Strauss, over to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Council President Gonzalez and apologies for the technological issues that we just experienced. Just wanting to highlight that council bill 120157 is before us today and it makes changes to Council Bill 120081, which the City Council passed on June 28.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this will increase the affordability requirements from 60% AMI to 80% AMI Council Bill 120081 Implementing a new state law that allows for larger buildings than zoning would otherwise allow for affordable housing developments on sites owned or controlled by religious institutions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The state law defined affordable housing as affordable to 80% am-I, as did the original version of Council Bill 120157 that was transmitted to council. The Land Use and Neighborhoods Committee considered the amendment to lower AMI requirements to 60% and decided against and rejected that amendment after hearing from stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The full City Council ultimately passed a similar amendment and lowered the affordability requirements to 60% AMI making Seattle's law more restrictive than the state law. Following these votes, my office and others were contacted by churches and community organizations expressing deep concern with the amendment, which works with and including from Nehemiah Initiative, which works with historically black churches'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in Seattle to save the black church in the central area into combat displacement. These stakeholders shared that the 60% AMI requirement threatened the viability of church affordable housing projects, meaning that we would lose affordable housing units that would otherwise been developed under this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Additionally, I heard that churches plan to use this ordinance as a way in ways that are more broad than what the City Council discussed during for council. In some cases, churches may wish to build affordable housing to allow their members to return home to communities that they have already been displaced from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of these members may not qualify for a 60% in my unit and they still have been displaced. I do not believe the city needs to micromanage how religious organizations best serve their congregations. Finally, I was reminded of the great importance historically and today of the Black Church is more than just a religious organization.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But as Don King, president of Nehemiah Initiative, put it, as the largest African-American financial, emotional, physical, spiritual service provider and the largest African-American land owner, period. He added much more. And I know that many more people will be speaking during the public hearing today.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I will end with this. Just noting that this legislation will amend the previous council bill to provide more flexibility to churches to serve their congregations, build the needed affordable housing, and maintain themselves financially so that they can continue serving their community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, counsel presence. Those are my remarks before the bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's so much Castmember Strauss Appreciate that context setting and additional information both for the viewing public and for us as council members. So as Presiding Officer, I am now opening the public hearing on Council Bill 120157 relating to affordable housing on property owned or controlled by religious organizations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Online registration to sign up to speak opened at 12:00 noon today and I am going to call on speakers in the order of registration. The online registration will remain open until the conclusion of this public hearing. The same rules apply to the same rules that apply to the public comment period will be applied to this public hearing'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Each speaker will be provided up to 2 minutes to address the council. Excuse me. And speakers are going to hear chime when they only have 10 seconds left of the allotted time. Your microphone will be muted at the end of your allotted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In their comments by seeing their name. And again, you have to press star six after you hear the prompt of you have been unmuted. Sorry folks, I'm continuing to experience internet stability so and have to turn my camera off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here again, public comment on this particular section is only related to the council bill just described by Councilmember Strauss, which is a bill related to affordable housing on property owned or controlled by religious organizations. So we're going to go ahead and open up the public comment period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to go ahead and start calling on folks who are both present and signed up to speak on this subject matter. The first person is Kirsten Smith, followed by Donald King.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good afternoon. My name is Kirsten Smith. I live in District one and I am policy staff at Air Seattle. The American Institute of Architects apologized for getting in on the list ahead of him because he should go first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He is a fellow of the air and we are pleased to support the 120157. We also appreciate the Council's willingness to take a second look at the legislation. The Provision Architect strive to apply our professional skills to advance racial and economic justice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One way we do this is to identify policy changes that make development work for bipoc individuals and communities, both to combat the risk of displacement and to generate wealth building opportunities. Adjusting this legislation to make it achievable for black churches to allow them to participate in the program without giving up control of their project to larger developers'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is an example of exactly this kind of policy adjustment. It also supports the city's commitment to eliminating racial disparities and achieving racial equity while deeper affordability programs are essential and needed to achieve additional city goals. You believe in this case and solve to be addressed elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We ask you to support Council Bill one 2157 thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for calling it. And next up is Donald King, followed by Joey Lopez. Of Europe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good afternoon. This is Donald King. I am president and CEO of the Myanmar Initiative of Seattle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in fact, in your name and again, you have the press.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, that's okay. We're all it. It is. Definitely. Let's start the clock over again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The next. It's I feel like today is extra Monday. So no worries. You have the full 2 minutes. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good. Thank you. My name's Donald King. I'm president and CEO of the Myanmar Initiative. And it is the mission of the Nehemiah Initiative to primarily one save the historically black churches, the predominantly black churches of central Seattle. And as part of that mission are we have two objectives in mind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One is to develop affordable housing on underutilized properties of the churches, which is quite abundant. And the second is to provide the church with income from the development of those properties for the churches to survive. So the churches can continue to do good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But also being well financially we are supporting of the passage of CB 120157 because it corrects a previously passed bill, an ordinance 120081 that was flawed. It had a late amendment added to it that required it eligibility of 60% area median income, which does not particularly work for our black churches.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We applaud those that work in the low and very low income housing provision market. But with the objective that I just told you about and the second objective of that is being able to make the black churches stronger through the development of their housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A threshold of 60% or a limit of 60%. Amid does not financially work for that objective. So I am urging you to pass this ordinance, to pass this bill into ordinance 1 to 0 one five. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for calling in today. Really appreciate it. Next up is Joey Lopez, followed by Benjamin Maurits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council President Gonzalez and members of council. My name is Jose Lopez, a resident of District three in the Safe Land Initiative Lead at the Church Council of Greater Seattle. I appreciate the time to speak today on behalf of the Church Council in favor of Ordinance 120157 to modify the affordability requirements adopted in the past ordinance as relates'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to affordable housing on properties owned and controlled by religious organizations. As many of you know, the Church Council of Greater Seattle is a century old organization that is committed to making informed, transformational change for deliberation and justice in partnership with Seattle's faith, community and community organization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much like many of my initiative, as part of this work, we facilitate a network of congregations and faith leaders through our Faith Land Initiative. Our initiative trained and developed faith leaders to cultivate deeper relationships within their congregations and neighborhoods, and a practice toward community stewardship of faith owned land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also mobilize Seattle's faith communities to take action by practicing transformative stewardship of faith owned land and engaging their lawmakers and elected officials as we look and legislating in terms of affordability. We have to realize the impact for people with the most need like Bipoc family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know the families that are our families are what will reverse the impacts of displacement and gentrification and policies that contribute to housing exclusion, like the city's history of urban renewal. Past debate focused on rental rates for studio and one bedroom unit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, 80% of am I for a three bedroom unit is $2,295. I. Reality is that housing of this size is almost nonexistent at this cost or lower. We must be mindful of the long term impact of our development decision providing space for the return of displaced black renters in a sustainable way that does not contribute to further'",
        "'speaker_3': 'racial and economic segregation. I urge you to vote yes on the passage of S.B. 120157. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for calling in today, Joey. Next up is Benjamin Morris. And then after Benjamin will be Alicia Ruiz.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is Benjamin Merritt, and I'm a housing developer in Seattle. I'm here today to answer the specific question of what is the difference between 60% AMI 80% AMI. It is a difference between many homes and no homes for a family of four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The difference between earning 63,000 and about 83,000 a year in income and for a housing providers, the difference between being able to charge that family a fair rent of about 6000 dollars per month, or about 20 $100 a month for a two bedroom home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But for somebody who aims to build housing and for whom, like most of us, must borrow money to do so, it's a difference between being able to pay off your construction loan and not being able to do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if you can pay off the loan and you are in charge, then it's the ability to have a bit of money left over afterwards to pay other bills and keep your community going. Now, not everyone needs to fund their operations in this way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Large nonprofits with access to federal tax credits and local subsidies can do just fine building at 60% AMI. And they should. But no one, not even the church with modest profit expectations, can build housing at 60% ami without subsidy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In Seattle, we now have the opportunity to allow smaller faith based groups, especially the black churches, the opportunity to revitalize themselves through housing and to do so on their own without subsidy that they must be able to build to 80%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ami, please approve this bill. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much for calling in today. Next up is Alicia Ruiz, followed by Gary Tyson.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, my name is Alisha Reese, and I'm speaking today on behalf of the Master Builders Association opinions and on which county and our nearly 3000 members are today. We stand in strong support of the amended version of Council Bill 120159 that would modify the eligibility criteria to require that all affordable housing units built on property owned by'",
        "'speaker_5': 'religious organizations serve households with an average income of 80% of AMI. The passage of this amended bill is an important step forward towards racial equality and also provide desperately, desperately needed affordable housing in our city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for calling in today. Next up is Garry Tyson. And then the last person I have signed up for this public hearing is Barb Wilson. Looking for Gary Tyson, who is speaker number? Oh, I'm sorry, since we were at the time, Carrie, but I think I just called on him.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we still have. Speaker 50? There we go. Okay. Just press star six and we'll be able to hear you. Gary, if you're with us, we just need you to press Star six on your end, and then we will be able to hear you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're not hearing the collar. So let's go ahead and move over to Barbara Wilson. It was number 58 on our list.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm Barbara Wilson, District six. Speaking in favor of 120157, increasing the permissible EMI to 80% would make it financially feasible for religious institutions with less land to build the missing middle housing at virtually no cost to the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This approach to increasing Seattle's affordable housing exists because a dedicated group of small historical black churches advocated for a state law requiring increasing density for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Such buildings on religious property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our own church in Ballard has been exploring building affordable housing at 60%. Am I on our property? We're privileged to have a very large piece of property, but you should know that the part of the property used for such affordable housing will be reduced in value by half.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The reality is limiting the definition of affordable housing to 60% AMI and below reduces the land value so much that it's financially prohibitive for the very churches who brought Seattle one solution to increase much needed affordable housing for black historic churches.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you wish to support the black community and their continued presence in their historical neighborhood, please press 120157. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for calling in today. Okay. Our last speaker is Gary Tyson. Let's see if we can get Garry unmuted and available to give us his comments. All you have to do is press star six. For us to be able to hear you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm still not able to hear Gary. I apologize for that. Sometimes these Zoom features don't work as well as we'd like them to. I would encourage you to email your comments to the full council at council that CEOs, you and CIO of Seattle don't shy away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry you waited this long and we're not able to get you on the line, but I am going to go ahead and close out the period of public comment. I don't have any other individuals signed up to speak for this public hearing, and we're going to go ahead and move to other items of business on the'",

This amendment makes it clear that this bill is not referring to the times that the Seattle Police Department may act as the security detail for any elected officials from the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Simply adds a sentence that says, quote, The city is not prohibited from providing executive protection to city elected officials on an official trip to a country meeting, either or both. Exclusion criteria in subsection 320 81418 and 320 8141 be enforced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Customer So-and-so That is the underlying amendment. My understanding is that Councilmember Strauss has an amendment to the amendment and it and that's what my notes are telling me anyway. So. So I will open it up to comments on this amendment first before I recognize Councilmember Strauss on his amendment to the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I don't know if this is a point of order or maybe it's not a point of order, but it's a question about an email that we received at 12:34 p.m. from number science staff. I was under the impression that Councilmember Swan was only putting forward amendments one in three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I we did receive earlier an amendment two as described by Councilmember Swan, but I was under the impression that Thomas Swan was not moving that forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So should I respond?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. You're welcome to you. I'll just sort of note that the that regardless of what was communicated before the amend, the motion has now been made. So we have the motion before us unless the sponsor wants of the amendment would like to withdraw that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is now officially before us. So customers want. I'll go ahead and hand it over to you to provide any additional clarification about your intent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, maybe there is, maybe was talking about each other, maybe there should be some clarification. But as far as my officer's emails are concerned, I as far as I understand, we were clear that we were moving three amendments and we showed them at 11:45 a.m., I believe, including this one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as members will remember this, the context of this one only came up this morning. So it was added today. So I'm actually not sure about the source of the confusion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure so that the records clear it is your intent. Just remember to want to advance amendment to as you just described it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Excellent. Okay. We are all on the same page. Slate is clean. We are considering and debating amendments to. Are there any additional comments on Amendment two again before we consider the amendment to the amendment? No additional questions. So I'm going to go ahead and recognize Councilmember Strauss, who indicated that he has an additional amendment amendment which was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'not distributed by 12 noon today because it was not distributed before noon today. And the council will need to first suspend the rules before this amendment can be moved. If there is no objection, the council rules relating to distribution of amendments 2 hours before the City Council meeting will be suspended to consider an additional amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hearing notes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, sorry. I thought you knew the second council president. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Just making sure that was not an objection.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, no objection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you so much. Hearing no objection, the council rule is suspended and Councilmember Strauss is recognized in order to move amendment. I think it's still to be and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what I was hoping to confirm. I believe it is now to see. And can you help me with this or ally?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We cannot hold on a minute. We cannot hear from non councilmembers or the city clerk without a suspension of the rules. So, I mean, so what would you need if you need to hear from Ali and or. And I'm happy to suspend the rules accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just 1/2, please. Just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or we need a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we are looking. Councilmember Strauss is confirming the version of which amendment he would like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before we look a second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To be or to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So I promise you all that it was going to be might get a little messy with these last minute amendments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council President I am moving, if you will, in just a second. I move to amend Council Amendment two by substituting it with the corrected version of Amendment to be, which was distributed at about 415 this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So hearing no objection, the council will assist and then in Councilmember Strauss is recognized in order to move the corrected version of amendment to be. Councilmember Strauss over to you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Council president. Do I need to make another motion or speak to it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We haven't yet suspended the rules. We are waiting for you to confirm which version we were suspending the rules in order to hear. So now is your opportunity to actually make your motion and ask. And then I will ask for a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there is second. If there is a second, then we can hear from you on the substance of the proposed amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. I moved to amend Amendment two by substitute, substituting it with Amendment A corrected amendment to B, which was recently distributed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded to amend Amendment two by substituting it with a corrected version of Amendment to be, which was recently distributed. I'm going to go ahead and hand it back over to Councilmember Strauss to address the substitute version of the amendment, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. Council president, colleagues. As I'm not on the Public Safety Committee or the committee in which this has come from, I was only beginning to review what came out of committee late last week. I thought some of the concerns that I had shared months ago had been addressed, and alas, unfortunately, they had not been addressed'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And so I worked quickly this morning to address those. We did create a drafting error before distributing the original amendment to be. And my apologies for any confusion that that has created. The amendment before you and council president.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we are able to see it on the screen, I would ask central staff to put it on the screen. One of the drafting errors, we were just trying to make the sentence flow more correctly. So the corrected version retains the formatting of the original version and simply makes this nation neutral by being, uh, by including all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'nations in the world, rather than engaging in an attempt to understand which countries have or have not signed on or are in accordance with UN declarations or committees. This simply says all nations period does not change any of the other content.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And can I confirm, can we pull this up on the screen so that colleagues can see it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. If if somebody from central staffs prepared to screen share, I have no objection to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then also including as it is allowed to provide executive protection, my apologies. If I had had more time with this, I would have included British Columbia, because they are our state to the north, our province to the north.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But unfortunately, we're out of time today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss. The colleagues, you do see the language that is being proposed to be changed here. So let's go ahead and take comments and questions on this particular amendment. Again, if we do need to hear more directly from council central staff, someone just needs to let me know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what they want to hear from. And I'm happy to suspend the rules to allow them to address the city council's questions. First person with their hand raised is Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Madam President. I would so move to suspend the rules to talk to central staff for just a moment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Possible break if there's been a formal request for that, colleagues, if there's no objection to hearing from our council central staff on the proposed corrected amendment as described by Councilmember Strauss, I would like to provide them an opportunity to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hearing no objection. The rules are suspended and we can hear directly from our council central staff, which at the moment is Allie Banerjee and Anne Gorman. So please feel free to respond to Councilmember questions as appropriate. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lewis Thank you so much, Madam President. On the question of to be or not to be, I'm not sure which of the two central staff folks I should be addressing it to. So just take it however you will in the way that this is crafted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are we assuming in the underlying like the text that is not crossed out above that that that is going to stay consistent regardless of what we decide? Because in reading that the scope is limited to military forces and not to foreign police.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's a foreign military. Oh, no, sorry. We're partnerships with the police forces, intelligence agencies, security services. So then this would ban trainings with Canadian officials. And I think Councilmember Strauss alluded to that. But I just wanted to ask that the top here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct? Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. Go ahead, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, and you're great. I was just going to say yes. That's correct. If I had had more time, I would have created an exemption for British Columbia as our province to the north. But alas, at a time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And so and are we going to rest then on Councilmember Strauss's answer to that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't have anything else to add as as written, this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ward ban training programs, exchanges or partnerships with with police forces in Canada.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. I don't have any additional questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The much I see that Councilmember Herbold has her hand raised. And then Councilmember Morales. Councilmember Herbold, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do this exclusively to ask questions. Or could I make a statement?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Its any comments on the proposed amendment are suspended however. So if you had a question, you need that question. But this is an opportunity for any and all comments on Council Member Strauss's proposed amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So just to sort of underscore the the issue raised by Councilmember Lewis, we received information from from central staff that from 2013 to 2021, Esprit took 48 trips to Canada. To be clear, though, a trip is one incident of travel by a single staff member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it looks like 13 trips were to attend a conference, two to provide executive protection, which would be exempt by this by this amendment. And two, to support a partnership and 32 receive training. In addition to the fact that this amendment would scoop in scoop in Canada.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've spoken to Seattle Police Chief Diaz, and I understand that the Seattle Police Department is currently working with agencies both in the United Kingdom and Sweden on crowd management processes, which have been along the lines of recommendations of our police accountability agencies and as drafted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it appears that this amendment could potentially impact this work. There are about 195 nations in the world. I just I'm just very concerned that the the impact is is is is is very broad of this with this amendment and is not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I understand that the intent of the amendment sponsor, it's not tied to an objective assessment of human rights violations and the human rights records. So I'm listening for my my colleagues arguments on this, but I am unlikely to be able to support this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because remarkable to Councilmember Morales, do you still have a question or comment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I was just pointing out as as Councilmember Peters sorry, Councilmember Lewis did that the first sentence here and the second sentence seemed to a slightly different things. The first sentence is shall not participate in training programs, exchanges with military forces.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the second one goes on to say, intelligence agencies or security services. So I my real question is, does that matter or will the broader interpretation be what is adhered to here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, and I think and I think just to be clear on my understanding, that might be relevant to. Two sort of context for that question is that the that language exists in the underlying legislation. So the only parts that are being proposed to be changed are those are sort of the the strikeout of A and B in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the addition of the last line. So the that the part that you're identified that may have a inconsistency in is included in the in the baseline bill. So thank you, counsel, central staff, whoever is doing this for highlighting the the text that is in yellow is what Councilmember Strauss's amendment is proposing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everything else is included in the base legislation that we are considering today. So at council central staff, any response to that particular question as presented by Councilmember Morales? No, no, no response. I, i, i agree with her characterization generally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Silence, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have two questions. It's possible that at least one of them has already been answered, but I'll go ahead and ask that just, you know, just to make it clear. So and my two questions are under this new amendment and would this ban all training programs, exchanges, our partnerships with the police forces of all other countries'",
        "'speaker_2': ', including countries, would almost be has had exchanges in the past, just Canada. It seems like the answer is yes. We had this exchange between you and Herb also just confirm that. And then secondly, under this amendment, would the CBD be permitted to attend training inside the United States that involve police forces, intelligence agencies or security services of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'foreign countries? Those are my two questions. President Gonzalez. I do have comments about this. I will observe them for a bit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The president may respond. And then Social Staff Councilmember Swan What I will say is that as to your second question, whether or not those trainings can or cannot occur on domestic soil is a question left for your base bill that's not under consideration for this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That doesn't happen. This amendment simply removes the characterization of which types of countries we can work with to just say all countries. Otherwise, it is not truly nation neutral. This is a nation neutral amendment. And to your first question, yes, the answer is yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And if and if you have follow up, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Enter in response to the first question. Yes, this this amendment would ban such work with Canada as as SPG is currently engaged in. And with respect to the second question, the way I read partnerships with the military forces of any country that would exclude United.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'States military forces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But all of the other descriptions of the types of units, foreign, military, police forces, intelligence agencies, those all have the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Qualifier foreign attached to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The only one that does not is military forces of any country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So but I don't I don't know. And if you address the my specific question was, what would they ask me to be permitted to attend training inside the US that like if the training happened on U.S. soil, that in a training that involves police forces, intelligence agencies or security forces, all foreign countries.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for example, good SBT officers go to training in Chicago, say to train with some foreign police forces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The way I read this bill, the operative word.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is with their training programs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exchanges or partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With the police forces. To me, this does not specified geography. Certainly we work to clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is the way I understand the bill as currently written.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What I might say is that this has been a process for counsel that should have been taken up at committee tells members. So it seems like you might also have questions about the base bill. I might.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ask. I don't have this, but you have provided this amendment at a very last second. It's about your amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's the base bill that you're that you have the question about. No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, absolutely not. Your amendment is sweeping, as my verbal also alluded to with other words. But so that's why these questions are coming up. This is not a minor amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why the question that you just had was about the part not highlighted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, it was not about the base. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council president. My apologies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to I'm just like if we get I appreciate this is not council briefing or committee meetings. So we do need to just take a pause and start going back and forth if we can, you know, work hard to not interrupt each other in the spirit of having an open democratic debate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I recognize and appreciate that these are several of these are last minute amendments. And those of us who have not been on the committee are working hard to catch up. And so I appreciate the opportunity for us to extend grace to each other as we are trying to catch up on some of these amendments, some of which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are more substantive than others. And again, as I stated at the top, my preference is always to do these kinds of work sessions in the midst of a lot of committee work. But alas, we are in a situation now where that is not the situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are going to go ahead and do our best to get through all of these amendments in a way that is hopefully useful to those of us who have to make decisions on the underlying. Bill. And on these respective amendments, I really appreciate you all working together to hopefully achieve them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, I want to make sure that council members want you got answers to the questions that you asked? Not yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I don't think so. If you don't mind. I just want to follow up. You know, I don't I it's not clear to me, actually, what the impact of this amendment is. I again, just to ask the question again, can the SPV be permitted to attend training inside the United States?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I heard what and said that the amendment does not comment on that. But that's the whole point. It does not. That is why there is this ambiguity that I think is here. And so, for example, can be a speedy participate in a training session in Chicago where the Israeli police shows up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I, I the problem is that the amendment removes all of the human rights standards out of the base bill, which is the which is the basic, which was the main and fundamental criterion for the existence of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And by that, by doing that, it creates ambiguity. And I just feel like the question I'm asking is a yes or no should have a yes or no answer again yes. BD For example, participate in a training session in Chicago where the Israeli police show up if this amendment were to pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And because now there's a because of this amendment, there is ambiguity about whether or not that hypothetical Chicago trip can happen. Because we know I mean, at least I know I don't know if council members will agree, but I believe that introducing any ambiguity is problematic, which is why the base bill, as amended, was taking great pains'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And we went to a lot of discussion with community, with council members who make sure that we remove these ambiguities. And from my standpoint, that that was extremely important, not only to make sure that everybody is genuinely in agreement, but also because I am very much afraid, given the track record, the overwhelming track record of the Seattle'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Police Department will, if we introduce ambiguity, will interpret it in a way that they want to, given their established practices, as opposed to what the community wants to want to accomplish with this legislation. So I would really appreciate some clarity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To President Mary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Darby. Ali Banerjee, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I'm going to invite my colleague and gourmand to jump in if I'm getting this wrong. But I'm going to attempt for just a moment, if you can bear with me to just do a bit of a close reading of the text on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So sentence one in the base bill would prohibit a study from participating in participating in training programs, exchanging exchanges or partnerships with the military forces of any country or engage in the travel. So I read that to mean you cannot travel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To that country to engage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the military forces, nor can you participate in a training, whether it's within the United States or housed elsewhere. Similarly, the base bill, as currently written, would prohibit expeditious, participative participation in any training programs or exchanges with police forces, except etc. and then it limits which countries you are talking about from which they are participating in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Strauss's amendment doesn't change whether or not the Seattle Police Department can participate in trainings with military forces or with police forces within the United States. So as in your example, a training in Chicago where a military force for another country must participate, participating the base, Bill Northey, and the amendment would prohibit that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Strauss's amendment does is it removes any specificity about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The countries that this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ban is applied to and broadens it, makes it neutral. It says SBT can't do this with any police force and and and clarifies that they can, however, provide executive protection if city officials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Traveling to those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Countries. Please. And or Councilmember Strauss, correct me if I'm mischaracterizing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll tell you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It. Agreeing with him. That sounded correct to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Because there was a lot. This was your line of questioning. So I just want to circle circle back and make sure you have finished your line of questioning here so we can I can call in councilmember misstatements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I just was I was just going to thank Ali for the Constitution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rates. Okay. Thank you so much. Customers want customer data. Your hand has been raised for a while. Thanks for your patience, David. Thank you. Thank you very much, council president. Thank you, colleagues, for this dialog. I want to thank Councilmember Siwon for initially bringing this legislation forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Herbold, for all of your work in committee and Councilmember Strauss for this amendment in front of us and really just bring us back to the answer that Ali just provided. I think the underlying goal here, as many community partners have continued to underscore, is to really keep us focused on making sure that as we re-envision community'",
        "'speaker_0': 'policing, it's really done through the community's lens and that we have a chance to hit a reset button when we think about what training looks like for our police personnel. It doesn't, and it shouldn't be done only by military personnel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are making a value statement here that going forward, training will not include partnership with other military entities or other countries and their and their military bodies. So I just want to orient us to the why we're doing this, which is to really refocus us back on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Orientation to what public safety should look like. And I think this is an important piece of legislation in that longer term goal. I also think that the legislation was enhanced in committee and community excuse me, in committee and and appreciate the clarification that's been offered by central staff here today about both the underlying bill and the amendment'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in front of us. Councilmember Strauss, appreciate the time that you've worked here to help make sure that we have a full understanding of how both the police forces, intelligence agencies, security forces, all of which we want to make sure are not getting trained by other military personnel or with other countries in their military personnel, regardless of where'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they are, including to our friends in the north. We do want to continue to reach out to our trainings in the future to be focused on community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Strategies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And partnerships with community, especially those upstream investments to create greater security so fewer folks ever interact with officers to begin with. I appreciate the clarification that's been offered on this amendment, and with that, I believe that there's support in the community for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With that clarification that's been provided by Allianz and Central South, thank you again and I look forward to supporting this amendment as well. Okay. Just to be clear, customer must get a year supporting Councilmember Strauss's amendment. And I wasn't the amendment to the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, which I also was the other amendment. But I'm happy to support this amendment that I think acts as additional strength, especially given what central staff has just said in their clarification. On Councilmember Strauss's amendment. Okay. Gets more her.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your hands been raised for a while. I'm not sure if that's new or a hold over or mover. Councilmember, you are next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, my comments were actually somewhat similar to Councilmember Herbold. So. So I guess you could have called on her again, but I would just reiterate and lift up what Councilmember Herbold had said earlier. I like I appreciate what Councilmember Strauss is trying to do here, and I appreciate anything that makes this conversation less about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'any particular country and more about a generalized set of our values as a city. The issue that I have, especially as this is broad enough to include any foreign police force, is there are examples of police forces in other countries that do have practices that we might want to study, that we might want to emulate, that might'",
        "'speaker_3': 'benefit from some kind of foreign exchange where our police can go and talk with their officials about what they do. Great example being crowd control practices in Sweden or other Nordic countries. Obviously, the United Kingdom historically has has stood out as a place that is generally considered to have a good model of community policing by international standards'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And then certainly our biggest trading partner, trade probably trading as well. But our biggest trading partner is is Canada, as demonstrated by the historic foreign trips taken. And I don't really know enough right here in the session about the nature of our training exchanges with Canada.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So given those things, I do think at this time, without knowing more information, I can't support this amendment given the broadness.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Lewis. Councilmember Salant. And then Councilmember Strom.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Going to present Gonzalez. I firstly want to congratulate all the activists and community members who called in to public comment in opposition to the original version of the amendment that Councilmember Strauss had sent out at 2:01 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to let all the members of the public who spoke and have been paying attention to this issue that you're organizing clearly had a powerful impact. The 2:01 p.m. version of this amendment would have removed the restrictions on training with police forces of human rights abusers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This 4:17 p.m. draft has been updated to now put police forces back and that does close a substantive loophole. But and, and that's good. But I, I also but I still have concerns about the whole point of this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So at this point, really, the only difference is this amendment also prohibits the Seattle Police Department from training with the police of countries that are not human rights abusers in addition to those that are human rights abusers. And keep in mind, I'm defining human rights abusers as per the mainstream, independent international human rights organizations define these issues'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So my intent and the intent of the exchange activists and with whom we have worked closely to draft this legislation, was to focus on human rights abusers as defined as that. And this amendment does not change how the bill impacts human rights abusers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I am concerned that if this amendment passes, that it will be used to, you know, to overall undermine the law, even if it went in place, because then it would be sort of a blanket term law which will not be accepted by a lot of forces in the you know, in the political establishment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for that reason, I will be voting no on this amendment. And and I just wanted to clarify, August 1st, I said that he brought this amendment because he he didn't think that the base bill brought in the idea of nation neutrality.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to clarify, the idea of nation neutrality was in the context of human rights abuses, not just in general. The objection to the very original version of the bill was that it only mentioned Israel and not other countries that might have also been recorded by the international human rights organizations as having abused human rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We we agreed with that and we changed it accordingly. So in that sense, it is nature neutral thinking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Obviously because we're strauss.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thank you and council president if there's no other further comments hopefully this my I will close it out for you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilmember Lewis, to answer your question about being too expansive or restrictive as you sit on the committee, I would suggest voting yes in favor of this amendment today and then separately creating a list of countries that are allowed to train with the Seattle Police Department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So being specific and proactive rather than looking backwards and trying to define councilmembers to want in response to your comments about my amendment. Without this amendment, there is a large loophole in your bill. And that loophole is being able to ascertain or understand whether or not the country in question does or does not comply with international standards'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Among a number of different lists that even we here at council have had a difficult time understanding today. And so I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, to make it to to remove the loophole that is in the bill, to make it nature neutral.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if further refinements to these policies are needed in the future to take that up in a proactive way. Thank you, council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss colleagues. I do think it's time for us to wrap up debate on this particular amendment. I appreciate the opportunity to have additional conversation about it and and thought that it merited having a little bit more time than perhaps we would ordinarily have, if for no other reason than the fact that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all just are learning about the this proposed amendment in the last hour or so. So thanks so much for your patience. Really appreciate your openness and willingness to to have that public debate. Okay. There are no additional comments on this this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of the substitute presented on excuse me on the on the substitute presented on the corrected version of amendment to be recently distributed by Councilmember Strauss.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Strauss Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or both? No. Juarez?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lewis?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or Alice? As. I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Petersen i.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Four in favor, five opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I turn my camera on, see? My Internet will cooperate with me. Great. The motion fails. The substitute is not adopted and amendment to is before the council. Are there any additional comments or questions on Amendment two as previously described by Council member?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Somewhat. And hopefully all still remember what Amendment two is to so maybe councilmember slot in an effort to close out debate on Amendment two. You can just quickly remind us what it was about because it's been a while since we talked about it and then we can take a roll call vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That is exactly what I was going to do. Just remind everyone, because it's been a while. This, as I said earlier, this amendment was drafted in response to the discussion we all had during this morning's council briefing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember Strauss had said at that time that he wanted to make sure that our bill does not preclude the Seattle Police Department from providing executive protections to city public officials on official visits to other countries. This amendment makes it clear that this bill is not referring to the times that that happens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It simply adds a sentence that says, quote, Speed is not prohibited from providing executive protection to city elected officials on an official trip to a country meeting either or both. Exclusion criteria in the. The two subsections. And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you so much. Okay, folks, if there's no additional questions, I would like to go ahead and call the roll on this. So will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of Amendment two?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Somewhat. Yes. Strauss Herbold. Yes. Suarez. Yes. Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Morales. Yes. Moschella. I. Peterson. II President Gonzalez. I nine. Favoring unopposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion carries and the amendment is adopted. Councilmember. So don't you have a Third Amendment that you would like that I understand you would like to make a motion on? I'm going to go and hand it over to you to make your motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, it's seconded. We will have a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I move Amendment three as emailed to counsel offices this morning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On their second second it's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment three. First one on the handed over to you to address the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And thank you to Councilmembers Morales and Miskito for also co-sponsoring this amendment. This Third Amendment adds a reference to the International Criminal Code statute, which was left out of the amendment that the Public Safety Committee approved last Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The current draft of the legislation cites two multilateral human rights treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as indicators of a government's intentions to abide by human rights and international law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, the amendment left out the International Criminal Code Statute also called the Rome Statute as another indicator of a government's intentions to abide by human rights and international law. Since the bill's exclusions provision in subsection B immediately below relies on the International Criminal Court as the body determining the violations of humanitarian law, it's only logical to cite'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the ICC statute along with the other treaties. So that's simply what this amendment does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much. Colleagues, any comments on Amendment three? Hearing no comments on Amendment three. Will the clerk please call the roll on the. Oh, I'm sorry. We're not calling the roll. Councilmember Herbold, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm so sorry. I'm so important. Objective. Satisfied with the criteria on the side of commodity was because we verified criterion that are both based in the foregrounding of human rights and our easy staff supply. As it relates to the I.C.E., as they are in the ICCPR, there are lists associated with those two treaties that establish those countries'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that are not signatories to the treaties. As it relates to the Rome Statute, it is in the inverse, whereas the lists that exist are indicators of nations that are signatories to the the treaty. I also have some confusion about what what is a signatory, what is a party to what is ratifying?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What does it mean to not sign? There's a lot of confusion about this addition. I'm I'm really sorry. I'm not comfortable supporting right now. Currently available data suggests this amendment would expand those exclusion criteria to an additional 48 countries beyond the approximately 35 countries that would be excluded by that criterion in the base Bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's about 45% of the world's nations. And I'm and I'm very uncomfortable with, again, broadening the scope of the exclusions on the exclusions that I, I moved in my amendment. This the amendment that is being proposed to the language is being proposed to be amended is a mandatory language to an amendment that I offered last week, specifically'",
        "'speaker_1': ', again, with with the intent of making sure that the exclusion criteria are are verifiable and simply implemented by the Seattle Police Department. I don't want the Seattle Police Department to have to do Google searches to make to figure this this out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just again, I'm uncomfortable with this expansion, and I feel really strongly that we're kind of making the perfect the enemy of the good here. And we have legislation that accomplishes the goals of of the bill sponsor, as well as community members who have been working to support the efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. Councilmember silence as.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I as of 2019, 123 countries are party to the International Criminal Court statute and therefore would remain liable training partners unless of course in the future they fail other criteria in the ordinance. And I'm actually not clear at all what the problem is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, as far as I can understand, it would take a police bureaucrat about 30 seconds disasters. It's easily verified. You go to the ICC website and you can see all of the participants. And just to clarify, also, my staff member did send Constable Herbold and others the link this morning when one council member first raised this'",
        "'speaker_2': 'question. I don't understand why the police should not be doing a sergeant, because it is it is a very it's a verifiable data on on a reputable website. It's not some random Google search. And also, I will add that this is an amendment that has been advocated for strongly by the community activists who first proposed the legislation'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We referenced the ICC in the following paragraph. So it's also about just technical clarity and consistency. It only stands to reason to include the statute in the earlier section because ICC is already being referred to in the following.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the Center for Constitutional Rights Experts say that this will help clarify the legislation further because of, you know, because it eliminates these inconsistencies. And that's where this amendment is coming from. It's not just the the the social activists who've been pushing for that and the exchange.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They are also they've also been in consultation with people who have some expertize on international human rights law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If First Councilperson. Are there any other comments or questions on the ministry? Hearing none I will accept comes in our salons closing remarks to me just that closing remarks on Amendment three unless there's anything else you'd like to add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I'm hearing no. Okay. Well, the clerk please call the rule on the adoption of Amendment three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Strauss No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Herbold No.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Suarez No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lewis No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Morales Yes. Let's get to I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Peterson No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three in favor, six opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion. The motion fails. The amendment is not adopted. Colleagues, now the amended bill is before the council are there and now is the time to make. And this is. Let me back up. This concludes the amendments that I'm aware of that were slated for discussion and consideration today during full council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So now is the opportunity to to hear general comments on the amended bill. I do want to acknowledge that we have two council members during council briefing this morning request an opportunity to be added to this underlying legislation as co-sponsors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those two councilmembers are Councilmember Morales and Mosqueda, in your comments on the amended bill, to the extent you intend to make comments, please indicate now in open session that you'd like to be added as co-sponsors to be the amended bill so that we make that notation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just let you start recording. So, colleagues, now's the time to make general comments on the underlying bill. Councilmember Salant Because you are the sponsor of the bill, you'll have an opportunity to make final wrap up comments at the end of end of debate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have had a lot of discussion about this particular bill. So so hopefully we'll be able to get through this quickly and take a final vote on this proposed legislation. First in line is Councilmember Morales, followed by Councilmember Mosqueda and then Councilmember Peterson and then Councilmember Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Council President We have had lots of conversation about this bill. I've had conversations with constituents who support this piece of legislation and those who oppose it. And I've tried to be really clear that my support for this comes from a place of really a deep commitment to human rights, as well as a firm belief that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we as a city should not be spending public dollars to send police abroad for the purpose of training with countries that are violating human rights. I'm also firmly believe that we should be moving our police department away from militarization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And really, as Councilmember McKenna was mentioning earlier today, really moving away from a militarization and towards more community based alternatives and toward a different way of policing. And that requires that we invest in the department in a different kind of way as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think they should be training with militaries or security services in countries that are engaging in human rights. So I do want to express my interest in co-sponsoring the legislation. And the last thing I want to say is that to those who condemned this bill as anti-Semitic, I don't believe this is about the Jewish people at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all. It's not about the Jewish religion. This is about the policies and practices of jurisdictions and of states and governments. And as a municipal official, I don't think we should be spending resources to send our police departments to other states and other countries for the purpose of any sort of training.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I look forward to supporting this bill, and I want to thank council members for sponsoring it and the activists and advocates who have been working with with her office and I think with all of our offices to garner support for the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Q.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, councilmember morales. Councilmember Mosqueda and then after councilmember Mr. will be councilmember peterson. Thank you very much, Council President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Colleagues, I want to thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You all for all your work to get us to this day and really.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Partners, folks that I've met with on all sides of the issue as well. But mostly I want to say thank you to Palestinian and Jewish voice for peace, who I know have done a tremendous amount of research on this legislation in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will continue to work with folks who we might not agree on this piece of legislation to continue to find pathways forward for greater support for humanitarian rights locally and across the globe. This is an important piece of legislation, and I want to thank House members for bringing it forward and Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For your work in committee. Again, I think that is important to really lift up that amendment that you made in committee that I know had quite a bit of support to help get this bill across the finish line here today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Strauss, thank you again for the legislation that you were aiming to amend today. Happy to have supported that. And Councilmember, so once amendment number three, that included the Rome Statute. I did support that. I do support it, I think would be helpful for us as a body and as a community to continue to look at the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rome Statute. This Rome Statute, quite literally led to the creation of the ICC International Criminal Court. And so I think it would have been a good addition to this piece of legislation. It would have still allowed for us to have trainings with other countries, over 100 additional countries, including countries that we lift up as good models, including'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sweden, Canada and some may include Britain as well. So I know that there will be ongoing work as we continue to try to make sure that this piece of legislation is adhered to. And I will continue to do a research on the Rome Statute to see if we can further strengthen in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is a piece of legislation that I think is a really important component to our ongoing work to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Redefine what community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Safety looks like and the different types of trainings that we want our officers to receive, trainings that are rooted in community alternatives to traditional responses, trainings that are not led by military entities, and trainings that no matter the country, are in line with our values of really wanting to have harm reduction strategies and to make sure that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we are not pulling in militaristic styles of engagement nor militarizing personnel. I do appreciate all of the works that all of the work that has been undertaken to move this legislation in front of us today and thank the organizers, the community and again, the council members that I noted for all the work that they put into making'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this legislation possible for us to vote on today. I look forward to supporting this bill in its current version, and thank you very much, Council Members, for your engagement as we consider various strategies to have public safety really rooted in community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Skinner. Next step is Councilmember Peterson. And then after Councilmember Peterson, it will be Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Herb.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, council president and thanks for guidance through all that parliamentary procedure with the various amendments while we actually share common ground to demilitarize our police force. I believe this legislation has been not only distracting, but also divisive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have heard from the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle, and Leaders synagogues in our city who are very concerned about the origin, intent and impact of this legislation. From a policy standpoint, I believe the legislation is seems to be an errant solution in search of a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the legislation has definitely been a time consuming distraction away from pressing matters such as our homelessness crisis. Countless hours have been spent trying to analyze which nations are or are not included in this legislation. And it appears that our Office of Intergovernmental Relations was not appropriately consulted by the original sponsor of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rather than veering into international law and international relations, we have plenty of ways right here in Seattle to deepen reforms and safety. And that includes revamping the police union contract, which expired eight months ago. I'll be voting no on this final bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Next up is Councilmember Lewis. And then after Councilmember Lewis will be Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Lawrence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. So I will also be voting against this ordinance today. And I want to say at the outset that I have appreciated the access that the advocates of this ordinance have maintained with my office. And I have gone throughout this process with an open mind to hear folks out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What was really dispositive to me was getting the information back from central staff, particularly this email we received from an informant on September 16th detailing the training that is occurring internationally, at least over the last decade, to illustrate the bottom line of what we're even talking about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, this does not, I would add, still substantively go into what exactly these foreign trips entailed, just numbers that foreign trips occurred. I don't know the nature or quality or substance of the trainings that have occurred that were ostensibly banning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's been assumptions and presumptions made by members of the public and other stakeholders, attributing perhaps that we learned the Seattle Police Department learned core crowd control techniques that have led to the recent extreme and on forgivable abuses that we have seen in recent months in regards to the demonstrations last summer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I've not actually seen anything indicated anywhere that there's any causal relationship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Between these trips.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in any event, we do have quantitative or we do have quantitative information about the trips that have occurred. So from 2013 to 2021, SBT apparently took six trips to Israel. Four of those trips were for tactical training, and they occurred in 2013, 2014.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there has been no training trip to Israel that's occurred in over seven years from the police department. Again, we don't have the particular nature of those trainings except that they were tactical in nature and I'm not really sure what they were or what bearing they have on the current department and the activities of the department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There were two additional trips to Israel, but they were for executive protection. They were there for with the amendments, for without fall outside of the scope of this ordinance and would not be banned by this ordinance. There has not been a foreign travel event, like I said, to Israel, of any kind in the last seven years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's notable that the 2016 trip that chief guest took that has been discussed extensively by advocates of the ordinance was not cited by the department as a trip that would be preempted by this ordinance. Presumably there's some loophole we're not aware of, or for some reason that falls outside of the scope of what the department considers a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'training trip. That was a trip. I'm just as background that was sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League that she took in 2016 and involved visits with Israeli and Palestinian officials in various capacities in the military. At least that was not cited in the report that and gave us one of trips.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not really sure why that is, but given that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Scant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Record of trainings with Israel and I'm not aware in the last ten years of any other international trainings aside from with Canada, which involved 48 trips of various types by far our largest trading partner, and given the amendments that passed and were considered, those trips are not banned by the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It seems that there is no ongoing or frankly concerning practice that this ordinance would prevent or stop. I'm not aware of any pending or planned trainings that the department is going to undertake in Israel. Indeed, it's been seven years and they have not does not seem like that is an ongoing exchange that the city has.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Were there a briefing or more process in the committee providing more detailed information about the nature of these trainings, why they're concerning what the Seattle Police Department is learning in Israel or similarly situated countries? That might change my analysis, but from what I'm seeing here, it's been seven years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't really know the substance of the trainings that did occur before then, and that seems to be the bottom line. Given that I don't think I need to go into any more detail. Those are my primary concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for that purpose, I'm not going to be voting for this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Lewis, appreciate you walking us through that rationale. Next up is Councilmember Herbold. And then after Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Herbold will be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Suarez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So very briefly, as background, when this bill was first brought to my attention, I did tell advocates that I would only allow a bill to be heard in the Public Safety and Human Services Committee if it were nation neutral, focused on human rights standards as applied to all countries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would not permit a bill on my committee agenda that singled out Israel because of the concerns that I heard from members of our community that told me that they were worried that legislation specific to Israel would inflame hate crimes against the Jewish people already on the rise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My support for this bill is very simply based in Seattle Council's statements in Resolution 31858 and 31928 and centered in the very first recital in the bill that Seattle is a human rights city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember Lawrence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, council president. Thank you, everybody, for your work. I will be voting no today as well for many of the reasons that some of my colleagues have already shared. But in general, let me just share a little bit of what my analysis is and then what my thoughts are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think this is the right arena, if you will. And I think today's discussion that started at 415 underscores the discussion, the confusion and the disagreement. We are not an international tribunal. It isn't our job to go through the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not the U.N. we're not the Hague. I'm not going to go back and read the fourth Geneva Convention and what happened in Switzerland. We're not the International Criminal Court or the Rome Statute, which I'm familiar with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm with the International Criminal Court statute. I do agree with what Councilmember Mosqueda said, and that was always my thought and intent, including what Council Herbals said. If the focus in the tent was on our values for human rights and that we get away from the militarization of our police force.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But based on what Councilor Lewis said as well, we have scant facts, quite frankly, that she can't convince me that we actually need to pass an ordinance, because I think what we're doing is we are punishing Israel. I think that this creates division.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that we're not being intellectually honest about what's actually going on here. Obviously, this is there is a bigger picture here of human rights that these issues, these human rights issues have been going on for decades. We are spending an inordinate amount of time on this when we have 16 items on today's agenda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And let me just share this with you, which really concerned me. I received three phone calls from three or national organizations, Jewish organizations that wanted me to know. And I also looked it up that the recent FBI hate crime statistics study for 2020 of the 57% religious based hate crimes were all focused on Jewish people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that to me is alarming when Jewish people make up 2% of the population. So, again, I don't want to go into this this about what is about going down this rabbit hole of international law. I think what we're really saying here is, is we're weaponizing our vote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one thing that's always disturbed me and most of the time I'm quiet about it or I listen, but sometimes we go and we weaponize our votes to hurt, to punish, to retaliate, to humiliate. And I think that's what we're doing today.'",
