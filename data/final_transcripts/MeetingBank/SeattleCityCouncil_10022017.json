        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you again, an issue that came through my committee. So I'll just sing a couple of bars about uptown and then ask if any of my colleagues have anything they'd like to weigh in on. I'm really pleased to bring this bill in front of you today.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'to live in the area. The changes would implement our mandatory housing affordability program, which would create a lot more affordable housing in the neighborhood as a result. We've also introduced some parking maximums to encourage the use of transit in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've incentivized arts and cultural spaces and space for school bonuses, including our pre-K bonus. And we had a really spirited debate within community about a whole lot of different issues. But I think that they all got resolved in a pretty well oriented fashion.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Is that continuing to be accurate?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And that's my understanding as well. There was a question that had come up earlier. I just wanted to confirm that that was accurate. But I'm sure we will hear from Spencer if it's wrong. But in the meantime, I really want to say thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has been four years of work. I don't see Jim out there, but Nathan Torgerson, thank you for all the work that your shop has done and much thanks. Councilmember Johnson.

        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks to all of you for your good work and others from that community.

That's going to make a big difference, not just for Uptown but also in Belltown in South Lake Union, as we are working to combine those neighborhoods in no small'",
        "'speaker_1': 'part because of the work we're doing around Seattle Center. It's going to make a wonderful difference, both in the vibrancy of all the neighborhoods, but the excitement and being able to get there without your single occupancy vehicle, the more innovative mobility strategy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, I want to acknowledge the good work that the community has done about making that happen. I understand that there is more art and culture going on in uptown than any neighborhood north of San Francisco. I'll take that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not sure that we've exactly had the count, but I like the approach. Also, members of Ward Street Alliance. Nancy, again, thanks to you for your help and to the Bayview community. I know that there was a lot of worry about that, the impact of shadowing on Bayview and there was, of course, debate about, well, it's already'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the tallest building. But considering what that building is used for, for some of our most vulnerable citizens, I've I believe that we're going in the right direction to have the 65 feet in that lot right in front of Bayview.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the rezoning obviously is not the end of the day. There's more work that we will be doing. But recognizing too that this is just the first step and I'm as your D7 representative, I'm really committed to making sure that this works and that the work, the additional work that we're doing now around Seattle Center is going'",

        "'speaker_0': 'That has been a piece of ongoing discussion about whether the appropriate height there is 65 or 85 feet. I support a well designed building at 85 feet at that site, but I've chosen not to bring an amendment forward today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understand that there is ongoing conversation between the Bayview property and the property owners of the one that's subject to the up zone. And I just encourage that those conversations continue to happen. There are other processes for that to hopefully be resolved, and I want to just commit to folks to stay engaged as a councilmember on that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and look forward to that. Community can have conversations. I don't think that the conversations were ripe enough to take action today, but I suspect with some good work on both sides, there could be a resolution that meets a lot of folks needs, and I look forward to supporting that if that opportunity comes back to the council.'",
