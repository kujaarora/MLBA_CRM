The department walked through one such building and estimated that approximately 10% of the tenants there would be eligible for relocation assistance because the ordinance has extremely restrictive means testing that even count the income of your roommate against you.'",

In fact, we have advocated for and won resolutions in the past, but we have not pushed for resolutions in place of ordinances when it is possible and realistic and'",

In fact, in fact, rather than just in rhetoric, would require an ordinance. And it is the city council, not the police department, that has the authority to pass such an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council members will remember that on June 29th, three months ago, my office sent for introduction of Council Bill. That would have done just that. And just in response to some of the public comment today on an issue that has not been resolved.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And I would really like to learn more about that issue, and I certainly appreciate those who spoke in public comment about it. The bill from my office was transmitted to Councilmember Herbold, who is the chair of the Public Safety Committee.'",

Why would we do a resolution? Let's do an ordinance. And I just don't I fail to see what the plausible reasons are for councilmembers who claim to support this issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You led an ordinance which takes concrete action, sit in the cities, computers on interviews, and instead push a resolution which only has the power to make a request. And as I said, I be voting yes on this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm really grateful to all the activists are really urge you all to keep mobilizing and organizing for this. But please understand that we will need an ordinance to be passed by this Council for for real action, to be taken for actual changes to be seen in the city of Seattle on the issue of psychedelics and decriminalizing'",

So I appreciate the councilmember silent has introduced or I don't actually think it's been referred to my committee, and I think we held it and did not refer it yet. So I don't think it's true that it's been languishing on my desk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But nevertheless, after some discussion about whether or not the bill should be referred to my committee, we agreed as a council that we were going to hold taking any action until we received recommendations from the Overdose Emergency Innovative Recovery Task Force.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Partially, this is because we're aware that there are going to be efforts in the wake of the decision and in the wake of legislation that was passed last session to respond to the Blake decision, there's going to be, I think, a really robust discussion at the state level about enforcement of not just Athena Jones, but enforcement around'",
        "'speaker_0': 'possession of of other drugs that are that are possessed for for personal use. So I think we're trying to be really sensitive to those discussions that are about to occur on a statewide level. And that's why we asked the task force to give us recommendations, because, again, this task force is not going to be just working on'",

They're going to be working on this broader issue of of enforcement of drug laws that are that are impacting communities with disparate impacts across across the spectrum of drug law enforcement and have, you know, for for decades, for generations.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'When I reached out to the police department to make a determination of whether or not we needed to communicate this lowest law enforcement priority to the police department. Based on my understanding of the police department's communication due out, the department is not only is it not the lowest law enforcement policy, but that officers have been instructed to'",

Now we know that policy might change. This is the existing policy of the Seattle Police Department.'",

I just wanted to clarify, just for the record, I'm I'm just quite surprised by kind of the more horrible response on the question of the process or the ordinance from my office.

        "'speaker_2': 'be introduced, though none of those calls were returned and all of this discussion happened in public. But it seems from what Councilmember Horrible said at the beginning of our honor just now, it was implied that there was somehow an agreement among the council that the bill should not be introduced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's not true. There was no vote. I have not certainly not agreed. I want the bill to be introduced, debated, discussed and voted on as soon as possible. I'm not complaining about all of this in in in any at any great length, because I was hoping that council would bring an ordinance if they because, you know'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I've seen this many times when my office brings an ordinance and the Democrats will bring their own ordinance, fine. You know, for us, the issue is more important, not whose name is in the city's registration legislation management software.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But but it is a tangible failure at this point to bring forward an ordinance regardless of whose name is on it. And that is why we need to raise this issue, because that that is not how it happened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What happened was that we, my staff and I followed up assiduously wanting the ordinance to move forward. But, you know, it's often these kinds of sort of bureaucratic channels are used to block it. And that's why that's that's your that's your decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But let's be open about it. Thank you. And I hope that there is an ordinance moving forward. And I again, I restate my invitation to council members to add their name to the ordinance. And let's discuss whatever remaining outstanding issues that are and let's pass the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Customer Support. Your objection is noted. For the record, I would like for us to refocus our comments and debate on the resolution that is before us, as opposed to a ordinance that is not before us at the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we could recommit to just focusing our comments in on the amended resolution that is before us, I appreciate it. Again, I appreciate that Councilmember Salant has expressed concerns about about a resolution passed over an ordinance. It is noted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's let's go ahead and and finish up our our debate on the resolution. I am going to give Councilmember Lewis the last word before he has the last word. I see that Councilmember Mosquito has your hand raised. So I would like to close out debate after Councilman Mosquito's remarks.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President colleagues, just to respond to some of the things that have been said on the record just a moment ago. Understanding the impact fees have been previously docketed and have been docketed for a number of years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Being docketed is a request to have the executive and executive departments study the issue at hand. And not only that, but counsel put forward the resources. And when I say study, that means to have CPA conducted on the policy proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Furthermore, the City Council has put forward the resources to have impact fees studied. So there is no we have made the request of the executive to have acted. We have put forward the resources needed to do so. At this time, we are waiting for CPA to be concluded and before we can amend the comprehensive plan to move'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It also places certain restrictions on the higher size limit, including that the site must be 500 feet from shorelines close to neighborhood, commercial or mixed use, mixed zones and not within a mile of another such facility. Indoor sports and recreation uses are defined in the code as including things like practice facilities, but not including spectator venues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That could drive large increases in traffic and visitation. In total, this legislation could allow for the development of such a facility on one of about 45 different parcels throughout District six and District seven, mostly in Inner Bay and in Ballard as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There have been some speculation in the press that this proposal constitutes a spot rezone. After consulting with the city attorney's office of PCB, the mayor's office and my colleagues, I'm confident that this does not meet those criteria. This legislation does not rezone any land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It does not allow, and it does not allow new uses. So, again, does not rezone land. It does not allow new uses in that zoning. It simply adjusts the maximum size of a use that is already allowed in this zone and applies that change to many properties across the area.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'for so long. As Sue Bird shared at public comment in committee. Teams can lose their star players when they don't have the infrastructure to support their players. For instance, practice facilities. If teams do not have a good place to practice and hone their skills off of the competition court, they may lose those star players.'",

        "'speaker_0': '. Several votes of the councilor began as related to proposed changes from industrial zone for the slot in the comprehensive plan. And when I learned that the legislation does not change the underlying zoning and maintains the current industrial zone, my concerns were addressed and I just wanted to kind of get that on the record.'",
