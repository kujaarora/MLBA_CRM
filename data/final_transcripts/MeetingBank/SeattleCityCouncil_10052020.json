        "'speaker_0': 'to be able to participate in an in-person room. This is a smart thing for us to do. It is sound public health policy that we are following and it allows for our city to continue to govern in a thoughtful way that is cognizant of the public health advice in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do take issue with any sort of accusation that this is being done for any other policy rationale other than trying to protect the public's health and make sure that the city government core functions can continue. This is why Seattle is leading the nation in strong public health policies and helping to slow the spread of transmission'",

And that's what this policy does. Again, it's a small procedural change to make sure that we can continue to move forward.'",

And you know, I just want to take a moment to thank Councilmember Strauss for navigating an issue that's been very difficult and that none of us anticipated was going to come up in 2020 in really changing the paradigm of how we do this essential process of community involvement and that there can be continuity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'with the assistance of technology to make it happen and that we can stand up on a system like this. And I appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with Councilmember Strauss on a couple of changes that Councilmember Strauss made in his introductory remarks on the bill regarding the timeline post-COVID that I know are important to a lot of constituents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in District seven and appreciate that that was I incorporated in committee. I know that there's been a lot of concern in the community on both sides with this legislation since the spring as an opportunity to sort of litigate the merits of design review and try to fight that battle in the context of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Basically, emergency legislation certainly was in the spring. Now is is more of a normal ordinance but still reflecting an emergency situation. And I would just say that, you know, I'm sure that's a conversation and a discussion that will come in its time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, we need to just make sure that the essential functions of government can continue in times of crisis. And. That may be adapted to reflect the public health situation. And as councilmember skater said, make sure that we are giving everyone the space to participate in these processes in a safe way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I do just want to say, you know, it really is due to the nature of the emergency. I don't think anyone on this council is thrilled that a lot of the work in the city has to be done remotely right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to to protect those that we love and those who are vulnerable in the community, this is really an essential thing to do. And I also want to thank Stsci for for being able to stand up a pretty impressive system to be able to do this.'",

The the ADR Administrative Design Review for for market rate projects is only going to affect 15 projects that have essentially already vested that right in the summer, in late spring, and that will expire at the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So going into 2021, we should be on a on an all virtual footing for these projects except for those projects that otherwise have exemption. So look forward to voting for this legislation today. No one is excited that a lot of these processes that typically involve in-person outreach have to be put on a virtual footing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it really is in the best interest of best practices and public health. And to do it this way and I and again, just appreciate Stsci and Councilmember Strauss's leadership in navigating a very complicated situation and doing it doing it quite well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, are there any additional comments on the bill? Councilmember Peterson, then Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You Council president. And thanks to I want to kudos to Chair Strauss for also navigating this and the amendment to shorten the time frame on this. The legislation seems to do a couple of different things. I definitely appreciate the rationale for continuing to exempt certain affordable housing projects from both design review and administrative design review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most affordable housing projects receive city money and are required to do a separate community engagement process anyway. So for me, it's really just about if we can maximize public input, community engagement, I'm in favor of that and I'm glad that CCI has stood up the virtual design review process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My my concern is this bill. Would those 15 projects would get to keep the administrative design review benefit for themselves. They're all for profit market rate projects. And I just think that they should have to go back to the regular design reviews since they can do it virtually safely online and provide additional input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So consistent with my committee vote, I'll be voting no on this legislation. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Input. And given that I voted against this legislation back in, I believe it was April, I want to just clarify for the record that the reason I did so in April was because we had a we were operating under.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A different set of rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And of course, there were there was different.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Interpretations of those rules under.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The types of legislation that we were permitted to be acting on. It seems like ancient history now, but we weren't. We were limited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To taking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Action on emergency legislation under the governor and the the AG. And I felt at the time that a portion of this ordinance did not fit into that rubric. That is not the case any longer. And so for that reason, I feel comfortable voting in support of this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Verbal. Thanks for reminding us of that legislative history. It was only in April, but you're right, it does feel like it was about a million years ago already. And that's an excellent point, that the proclamation that limits or provides exemptions related to the Open Public Meetings Act is been pretty drastically modified to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'allow us to consider things that are not just strictly related to COVID anymore. So I appreciate the reminder around that particular perspective. Any other comments on the bill? Members trust. You have the last word as it appears that no one else is interested in making any comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please take us home on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Council President and colleagues, just to also echo the words of Council Member Herbold and Mosqueda regarding this is not a way to use the Cogat emergency to make permanent changes to legislation. There have been a number of aspects of this legislation that have been received very well in community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Virtual Design Review is one of them, and one of the things that I wanted to begin looking at is if we could make a combination of in-person and virtual design review because of requirements that in-person design review meetings occur in a new community and near the projects that they are reviewing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does make it difficult to cohabitate virtual and in-person design review meetings because a lot of the rooms that in-person design review meetings are held in are not a set up for the technology that we need to use for virtual design review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, again, separating permanent changes from this temporary from this extension of emergency and temporary changes demonstrates that we are not slipping anything through or using this emergency as a cover. Rather, we are making important process changes that protect public health and continue the direction that we are heading with the number of COVID cases that we have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in our community. So I look forward to reviewing this, the positives and the drawbacks that this emergency in this legislation has created in our community and making further changes to our design review process in the future. Thank you, colleagues.'",
