        "'speaker_9': 'I also want to thank socialist, alternative and socialist students for being here, and I particularly want to thank the fantastic organizers from the Washington Community Action Network and the Seattle Education Association, and particularly Sochi. Michael, which for showing such incredible leadership.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If we if we succeed in passing this today, it will be because of your our activism. And if we are delayed today, it will be because the senior council members who say that they are on the side of the tenants are actually on the side of the landlord lobby.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we will continue to fight until this council bill becomes law. I also particularly want to thank all the property owners and property managers who came to speak today in favor of moving fees. They are testament to the fact that there are landlords who are doing the right thing and that this law will not impact them negatively'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at all. This law, like every other tenants rights bill, is to make sure that renters do not have to depend on joining the landlord lottery in order to have fair renting conditions. We want all renters to be protected by the city law, and that is why the good property owners are also here speaking in favor of it'",
        "'speaker_9': '. I also want to thank council members Herbold O'Brien, Suarez Gonzalez and Johnson for engaging with this bill thoroughly in committee. And I look forward to my colleagues support for this tenant rights bill. I would also urge Council members to remember that the burden of activism falls on ordinary working people, and the more we delay it, the more'",
        "'speaker_9': 'they will have to take time off work in order to fight for their basic rights. So I urge voting on this and passing this on a full council today. As I said before, the Energy and Environment Committee unanimously recommends five votes to nothing that the full council pass this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And lastly, I will say this council has just voted unanimously to support Initiative 75 against Citizens United, which means that the Council has taken a formal position that corporations should not be treated as people and that elected officials have to represent people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's vote yes on this bill to show that we truly stand with ordinary working people, not with corporate interests.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So once we have an open discussion on the bill on the floor and I know I am also aware there are some potential amendments as well. Councilmember Worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. First of all, I want to thank all of you that are here today that provided public comment about this very important piece of legislation. I also want to thank my chair of my committee or her committee councilors who want in Herbert for all their work, as well as Ali from central staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Before I go any further, I just want make one comment that discussing a potential bill is different than passing a law and then changing your mind a year later. So let me start with the facts and where we're at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On a personal note, I know what it's like not to be popular being a caseworker at the Saladin Center. To being a public defender. Legal services. To being a judge. And to representing tribes in underrepresented communities. But let me just say this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe in this proposed legislation. I believe in its intent. Its goals is protection of renters, particularly low income renters, and today's housing crisis and rising rents. My sole purpose in requesting that this very important piece of legislation be referred back to committee now allows.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Back to Council member Sawant, in which I am also the vice chair, is to answer some very critical questions that I believe need to be addressed. What I want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is I'm going to ask people refrain. I know it's tempting to just shout, but please let her speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I want this legislation to be able to withstand any legal challenges or concerns from the people it will affect. I want it to be able to be able to withstand any type of scrutiny and to ensure it is implemented, executed and applied with rigorous enforcement and cooperation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want the transparency and public comment necessary to address outstanding issues from the public and those that provide housing, including the education, a real education piece. I'm committed to working with all stakeholders and as the Vice Chair of this particular committee, I look forward to working with council members who want Gonzalez, Herbold and Johnson to make sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we do this right. I also want to see the Department of Construction and Inspection Inspection to work with our committee to make this legislation a model and a successful law. Hopefully, we can build a strong foundation and we can build upon this proposed law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As some people stated today, this law doesn't go far enough. And I agree. Furthermore, I want to incentivize landlords to lower moving costs. I don't want the unintended consequences of landlords raising rents. And also, more importantly, I would like this legislation after more consideration, to become the law of the city and applied with all deliberate speed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I don't want I don't want this to make this a us versus them issue. I don't want to kill this bill. I don't want it to divide us as a city where it's clear we all want the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We want to make it easier for renters to move in. We want to remove barriers, and we want to allow installment payments for moving fees. I don't want to see or create loopholes. I don't want this to become a wedge issue where we get bogged down in unrealistic objectives and expectations or have it stalled because some stakeholders'",
        "'speaker_4': 'believe they were not part of the process. I don't want this proposed legislation to pass and then sit on a shelf somewhere because like a lot of laws that I've seen since I've gotten this job, we did not do our due diligence.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We weren't pragmatic on how we actually implement and enforce the law. As it stands, the proposed legislation would go into effect January 2017. That is true on September 27th. There are many issues we looked at and that was 20 days ago and now we're in the middle of a budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So why my position is this and have some more to add. The benefits of referring this legislation back to committee far outweigh the burden of fixing things way after the fact, as I have witnessed in my short time here on city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to see us set up for failure, but success. During this morning's hearing, you heard comment from all of us about how we felt about what we wanted to do with this legislation. This morning, I received a statement from CCI.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They expressed support for having this legislation get more committee time. Stsci has been charged with implementing several new landlord tenant laws, including the Rental Registration Inspection Ordinance Real and the new source of income discrimination law. Given these changes, Stsci would like more time with with council members to ensure there's a coordinated effort for implementation and enforcement of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all landlord tenant laws. I would like this work to be done at this table, not staff to staff. Again, I'm very supportive of the intent of this bill, and I believe I helped draft it. I met with many people from Kan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My staff and I looked at other states, the other 49 states to see what kind of legislation was out there and in fact, gave them ideas about how they could make this this piece of legislation stronger. The need for better access to housing continues to be a struggle in our current housing market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also recognize that landlords have to take up the responsibility for providing housing to people. And just like we expect every other business to follow certain rules to ensure health, safety and access, we are asking this sector to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want it done right. I voted this bill out of committee and when I did, I asked for more time for council members to deal with some outstanding issues and concerns from the last meeting from September 27th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like I said, that was 20 days ago. During that meeting, council members had limited time to address seven new concerns with the language of the bill, its potential effectiveness, its ability to hold all parties accountable. One of those seven issues regarding enforcement had ample discussion, but it came to no resolution at that time, and the other six'",
        "'speaker_4': 'issues got very little time for discussion. In the interim, the enforcement issue was resolved at a staff level staff, not council members. This legislation has only had only two meetings in committee. The CCI inspection. The department tasked with enforcing and monitoring this legislation never got a seat at the table to discuss the bill.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Implementation, enforcement and costs since September 27th me here. There have been several meetings with staff and council members all behind closed doors without the input of the public attempting to clarify the outstanding issues. I'm not suggesting anything nefarious was going on, but my concern was that these additional issues were not is resolved and done transparently at that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'table, not appear. Is the city going to require that tenants have a lawyer before changing the terms of their own lease with their landlord? What is the effect of holding fees that are typically collected the time of application before a lease agreement is written?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a way to use this legislation to incentivize lower moving costs? We haven't had a chance to share with the public what enforcement mechanism or outreach mechanisms have been put in place. Should we take the time to do that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also have landlords in the city with experience doing payment plans with their tenants, specifically nonprofit housing providers and landlords that participate in the multi-family tax exemption programs. We should have them at the table and talk to them about their experiences or successes and learn from them how we're going to set up our law for success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And yes, I could do all of this in my office behind closed doors, but in my but it's my job to make sure legislation holds up to public scrutiny in the public interest. That's my job. Not to be popular, not to be right, but to do it right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I we I believe we need transparency and that work should happen at the committee table. Given the potentially significant changes happening today and the questions still left to discuss, I motion that Council Bill 118817 be referred back to the energy environment committee for additional committee work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So why are you serious?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This was not an easy decision. Excuse me, sir. If I can continue. This was not an easy decision for me. I have to admit, I have tremendous respect for my colleagues and the dedicated staff working on this very important issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not important for me to be right. It's not important for me to be popular. I just want to get this done right. And I want this law to withstand and hold up time. And I want to make sure that Seattle remains a progressive city and working with our landlords and our renters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what's on the table is a motion to refer back to the committee for the Bill Back to Customers Wants Committee. That discussion will take precedence over the amendment, so we have to hold off on the amendments to resolve this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want to remind both the audience, all my colleagues, that the bill in front of us is not effective until January one, 2017, even if passed. So if the work is done, it could still be done before the effective date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But right now we have a motion to refer back to the same Energy and Environment Committee. We can have more discussion, but before we do that, I'll ask if there's a second that's been moved in second. And so it's been moved to second to refer back to the committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I remind again my colleagues before the effective date, we would like more discussion from any of my colleagues and at the end of discussion we will have a vote since has been moved in a second councilmember back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Shall I just thank you. I just want to assure all my colleagues that I support this bill. I would vote for it today and I will vote for it if there are amendments. I just want to make sure that those who have asked for more time get the respect of having more time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very good. Any further comments from any of my colleagues, Councilmember O'Brien and Councilmember Sharma.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will I will not be voting for the motion to refer. I support the bill. I understand the questions and concerns. But I having been through the committee meeting and had a chance to review this, I believe the legislation is sound legislation as it is today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that if there are things that continue to come up between now and January 1st or even in the future that we feel like we need to address, there's always the opportunity to do that as we are in the middle of our budget session.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know that there's a lot of opportunity for a while to get back into it, and my strong preference is to move forward today on this legislation, the sound piece of legislation that I think could have an immediate impact or a January one impact on a lot of folks that are struggling today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Because it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cancer. I'm going back for the hearings, Councilmember Herbold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. My preference is as well to vote on it today. Last week on on Friday, I was asked whether or not I would actually support referring this bill back to my own committee, my own civil rights committee after the completion of the budget process at the end of November.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I said at that time I wouldn't. I was asked to support re referring the bill to Councilmember Johnson's Planning and Land Use Committee again after the completion of the budget process at the end of November. Again, I said I couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As has been said, the drafting for this bill began in February this year. It was sent to the Council President's office on July 13th, and this council voted to refer it to the Energy and Environment Committee on August 1st.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On September 13th, the bill was discussed in committee. Several amendments were made. On September 27th, the bill was again discussed in committee with more amendments being made and the committee voting 5 to 0 in favor of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two council members at that time requested additional time before a full council vote. That time was granted and the commitment fulfilled. I do believe there's a great deal of urgency around this issue. Upfront housing costs are a major barrier to accessing housing, making more and more people unsheltered.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Seattleites, including homeowners who have major concerns regarding our homelessness crisis, expect us to take concrete legislative steps now to get people into housing. Building more housing and shelters takes time, but reducing barriers to housing is something that we can do now and will work in the long term.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For this reason, I told Councilmember so on last Friday that the only way I would support a re referral of this bill is on two conditions. One that it be referred to Councilmember Sawant's committee, not some other committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And two, if the Arts Council Budget Chair, Councilmember Burgess, agreed to allowing Council members to want to schedule a committee meeting during our budget process, waiting until after the completion of the budget process would mean the very earliest the committee could meet would be on December 13th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I could not and cannot support that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So all eyes are on me at this point. That's all customers want.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Appreciate the comments by councilmembers O'Brien and Herbold. For those of the members of the public who might be tempted to buy into this argument that has been made by some council members that there was an adequate discussion. I would urge you all to watch the Seattle Channel recording of this morning's briefing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, the council meets for a briefing at that table every Monday morning. And at that meeting, I thought Councilmember Horrible laid out a very good summary of how much detail had been discussed at the committee meetings. So there's not been any shortage of discussion on the details of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think if you watch that video, you will know that every single aspect that that has come up was discussed thoroughly. Councilmember Juarez, who is a member of the energy committee, missed the first meeting when we discussed this on nine September 13.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Now, sometimes council members have to miss meetings. I have that same experience, and that's fair enough. But if as an elected official, you miss a meeting, you cannot tell struggling renters that they have to wait for their rights to be upheld because you need more meetings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But more importantly, more importantly, there have been two and a half weeks between the committee vote and today. I have not seen Councilmember Juarez do anything with that time. It's not like she approached me for discussions about this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not like she has brought up new amendments. So I'm not clear at all that if I am to take this request for more time at face value, then what exactly is going to be accomplished by this further delay?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's not clear to me at all. As far as the claims that this needs to be legally sound. I want members of the public to know the city's law department and the city. Seattle Department, Department of Construction and inspections have thoroughly vetted this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at this point, all the departments that are relevant for this legislation have given us the go ahead. So there is no honesty in this claim that we haven't included the departments. As Councilmember Herbold said, we we've discussed this for months, and the first people we interacted with my office interacted with was the department because we wanted'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to make sure that this law was legally sound and all of that has been addressed. I also want to make it clear that when councilmembers say that they want transparency, the public please know that this process of moving this motion to delay was so transparent that I was not approached at any point about this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I knew about these plans to delay it and any attempt to send it to another committee, only because Councilmember Herbold share that with me, as she mentioned. So that's the transparency that they are talking about. And as far as their transparency that we have engaged in, we have brought these discussions out into the open.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For months we have been discussing this out into the open for months. Landlords have been able to weigh on this. As I said before, they've spent 18 to over $18,000 in the last three months, which is more than the average Social Security recipient makes in a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they've had ample opportunity. And yet this bill passed out of Committee five to nothing. And I'm not sure that the council members who already voted yes on it, I'm not sure why they are now voting to delay it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you're voted yes on committee, that vote has to count for something. So I'm I'm still unclear. I would prefer it if council members came out in the open and said they've had phone calls from landlords and they're trying to delay it at their behest.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the last point I'll make is this my sisters and brothers, this is what the corporate politicians mean when they talk about the Seattle process. It means, Jane, make up as much as possible, manage the rights of ordinary working people.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when it's for the police department that is cited by the Department of Justice and for corporations, then ram the process through to make it happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we will keep fighting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We will keep fighting to make sure not only this law is passed, but also that every tenant's right is upheld. And I will I will request all my colleagues who are going to vote yes on this motion to actually speak openly about why you're doing so and not just vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see a few folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Few hands up, but I missed the order, so. Councilmember Herbold, did you want to clarify something after you saw your hand go up right after you spoke?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I didn't need to clarify anything, but I was signaling for one of my two conditions potentially to be responsibly spoken.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in that condition, being the meeting in after budget or before budget or during budget?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'During budget?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'During the budget. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Burgess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Along with someone else in. Q after Councilmember Burgess. Okay, everyone. Okay. You get you'll get what you want. Everyone. Everyone. Put some skin in the game. Remember, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Responding to Councilmember Herbold request. And so I have checked with council's central staff, which more than maybe any of us up here controls the schedule for the budget. And yes, we can accommodate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An additional meeting of council members who wants committee in November.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that clarifies that matter and consumer concerns. Did you want to respond back? Councilmember Herbold, so sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm making faces here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Like I do. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. So I am very aware that this bill doesn't actually go into effect until January 1st of 2017. And I guess from my perspective, there are there are three things that would be nice to see added into the bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if we had an opportunity to have another hearing in November in councilmembers, the wants committee, which I sit on, I, I think it would be helpful. The three things that I'd like to see substantively changed is I'd like to see an anti retaliation provision added to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like to make sure that there is a reconciliation between this proposed ordinance and the city's just cause ordinance, which prevents tenants from being unjustly evicted from their homes when they're on a month to month tenant agreement. And the last thing that I had brought up in the committee hearing, I think in early September or maybe late'",
        "'speaker_7': 'August, was related to what to do about landlords obligations to put money into an escrow account, that that would be an interest bearing account where that interest would go back to to tenants at the time that the tenancy relationship ends.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so if there is an opportunity to to go back to committee and develop those three things, which I don't think are loopholes, I think those are actually pro tenants and would be helpful to two tenants in this endeavor to make sure that we are shifting power from the landlord over to the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would really appreciate the opportunity to be able to develop those three additional policy proposals as part of this bill. The other thing that I would mention that, you know, one of the amendments that I had made early on is reflected in Section 12 of the existing bill, which creates an explicit requirement by the Seattle Department of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Construction and Inspection to engage in community outreach and education that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for communities. And it instructs the department to work both with the Office for Civil Rights and with the Office of Immigrant Refugee Affairs to make sure that we are setting up the appropriate language access provisions that are going to be necessary to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'educate, particularly tenants who may not speak English or understand the system that we have here in terms of how the landlord tenancy relationship exists. And during this budget process, I am seeking an additional $50,000 of funding to support that particular out outreach work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I am committed to this this policy. If there's an opportunity to continue to work on it, I would I would support that to the extent that I'm allowed to propose these three additional policies as part of this of this council bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so long as it goes back to the Energy and Environment Committee, so that councilmember can continue to lead on this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I concur with what I've heard from several of my colleagues related to not wanting to change at all the effective date of this legislation. I think the fact that we've got January 1st effective date doesn't preclude us from spending a little more time to make sure that we do get the legislation right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'From my perspective, as the person who as committee oversees the Seattle Department of Construction and inspections, I've had a chance to talk with them a little bit about just sort of the implementation of this as it relates to other critical pieces of legislation that we've adopted this year and that I've been supportive of, including the first in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'time legislation as well as several of the other prohibitions on rent increases when unions don't make basic standards, basic maintenance standards provisions. I think that there's also a direct correlation here between the work that we're doing and the budget process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I believe that there's a strong responsibility for me as the person who oversees the Department of Construction inspections to make sure that they've got adequate resources to do outreach to tenants and landlords, to make sure that everybody does understand the effectiveness of this law and its implementation.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, again, I concur with colleagues who have said that January 1st is still my intention. My intention isn't to delay this process in any way, shape or form. The fact that we have a little more time to bring this back to Councilmember Science Committee is something that I support without delaying the actual implementation, but making sure that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we've got the. Funding in the Department of Construction inspections to really do the work. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May I?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. COUNCILMEMBER Worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to address it. Something that. It's kind of the elephant in the room. I don't believe any of us here who want to work on this bill want to kill it. I don't. I don't want to create a landlord loophole.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not. I don't know where this landlord conspiracy and we're against tenants and renters come from that certainly it. It certainly doesn't come from. So when we talk about things, I think it's important for people to know that when I do hear from the CDC, who will be in charge is us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they are telling me, telling us, told me today that they would like more time on this in light of what Councilmember Johnson just shared. And I want to add that I did speak to Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Herbert told me, and I concurred, and I could have done the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And she said, Well, I'm going to let Councilmember Silent know what's going on. And I said, okay, great. I didn't think it was a big secret. I wasn't trying to hide anything. I think that when people make this personal, I think people need to know in this room that I actually work really well with council members who'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want. I consider her a friend and I actually enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Work my whole life.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I hope so much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was will find it. Well, my wife kicked me out now. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, my hope is that we can create this and make it a incredible law that we can be proud of, that we can implement, that doesn't sit on the shelf somewhere, and that a year from now we're not fighting about definitions, enforcement, education, how do we implement it and who does it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This isn't about not passing this law. It's just asking for the right and some more time for it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so I'm going to call for the question and I'm going to ask people vote by show of hands. And before I do that, I want to make a few statements. There's been a few very negative, I think perhaps allegations or accusations that were made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I first heard as an example about a motion for a delay this afternoon. And when I first heard it, I grabbed my colleagues and said, How do you want to handle this? I pointed out quickly that the effective date is January, because if it did get referred, we all wanted to go back to Customer Response Committee'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in July. We had to make a decision as a council as to what committee this would even go to, because one could argue it was a housing issue, one could argue was a planning land use issue. But we know Councilmember Want is probably been the strongest advocate for tenants and a leader in that regard, probably nationally known'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for that. So very appropriate for her to shepherd this through. When this does pass, this is going to be a glorious day. It's going to be nine in and. Oh, and whether it passes today or not to me is, I think, gives some closure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't think we're going to open up in the middle of a budget. We're right in the middle of the budget. So I want it to be a glorious day to speak volumes to this country about what we're trying to do for renters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just don't like, quite frankly, the personal attacks, because I assume everyone up here are trying to trying to good do good by the city. So having said that, this motion is on the table to refer Council Bill 118817 back to the Energy and Environment Committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was some discussion, by the way, about there could be a meeting during November. So all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Can ask for a clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You mean do we need to include in the motion that it will be during the budget process that we will have a special meeting?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't. I'll put it this way. I don't think it has been a motion, but I'm just stating on the record that everyone here has full intentions to have a meeting for you to have a meeting during the budget so it won't be a substantive part.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You see this heads nodding with the TV going that that means, yes, we're going to have a meeting in November. And so we'd be castigated if we didn't. So not part of the motion, but part of the understanding on the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So what was that date in November you back to. Know how did you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'By December 13th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By December 13th. Okay. So what we're going to do comes from Swan is I'll make it in the motion that will have a report back date by your committee on December 13th, said on Monday I hope that Sunday what I know can we we by December 12th so I'll start over and said cleaner but Councilmember Gonzales yeah'",
        "'speaker_7': '. My preference would be if there's no objection by councilmembers the want is that the motion be couched in a way where it would be by December 13th. So it's the latest, but it could come back sooner if if it's ready.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would prefer that, actually. And also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just I'll say on this for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just to remind the council, several councilmembers have already taken official leave for for many of the weeks in December, starting late November. So it's better we do it before late November, actually, because we want the council to be present.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the report back will be on or before December. We said 712 or 1312. Okay. So. So we'll schedule the meeting when we get a good turnout. So let me clean my motion up a little bit or clean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember This motion up. Council Member No, I'm not, sir. Not in Seattle. Councilmember Suarez's motion is to refer the Council Bill 118817 to the Energy Environment Committee and a report and with the understanding that there'll be a report on or before December 12th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the motion. Is there a second? All those of favor? Vote I in. Raise your hands by all the polls. Vote no and raise your hands. No, sir. The vote, the motion refer pass 72 and we will move to the next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll move to the next agenda item.'"

        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Council President Accountable. 118683. Update Seattle 2035 which is our comprehensive plan. We update the plan every year, but this year as part of a major update and has been in the works for probably about five years now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As I mentioned this morning, we've been discussing this bill for about six months now through no less than ten committee meetings, as well as eight meetings of other committees and two public hearings. We've heard a lot of testimony and received a lot of comments, and the committee made significant changes to the plan with over 180 amendments.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'As we all know, Seattle is growing and changing rapidly, and we're lucky to be experiencing such continued prosperity. But the city changes to this plan are needed to help us respond to and guide this growth so that our city can continue to be an equitable city, to address climate change impacts and to ensure that we have homes'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that are affordable to all of our residents. I know that there are a couple of amendments that we'll be discussing, so maybe I'll save my overarching comments till after we've had a chance to discuss those amendments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, Councilman Johnson. Should we take the House mayoral? Should I go first? Would you like to go first?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe Amendment One is the community involvement element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, you go first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. So Amendment One to Council Bill 11 8683 is to clarify sections of the new community involvement element without changing the effect of 11 8683. It adds a number of definitions defines the term community plan is a plan that also specifically addresses neighborhood or geographic based planning as a plan developed in collaboration with the community around'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a shared vision that includes a specific set of strategies to meet the community and city goals. It also amends the discussion under inclusive and equitable community involvement. On page one and attachment three as as follows. So that it reads Equity is essential to any community involvement process to improve relationships and outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city is committed to conducting inclusive and equitable community involvement that effectively reaches a broad range of community members, particularly those affected by communities decisions. There are a number of other amendments specifically relating to considering specific areas with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Specific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Characteristics when making a decision about allocating city resources for community planning and including neighborhood planning, and those specific areas being areas designated as urban centers or villages in the comprehensive plan. Areas with high risk of displacement. Areas with low access to opportunity in distressed communities.'",

And I really appreciate Councilmember Johnson allowing for additional time to do the required legal noticing around this this new element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Herbold. We'll vote on the amendments separately. So, so, so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we did have testimony. We we didn't have enough time, but we had we had for 40 minutes. I'll tell you what. I'll let me finish the amendments first and I'll address the public comment issue after. So Councilmember Herbold has made amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll describe that as amendment number one to council bill 118683.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor of Amendment one, say I. I opposed the idea that as First Amendment, I have a Second Amendment I like to describe and it's clarifying the meaning of environmental justice and C 12.3 and clarifying what I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think what the public believes is the public health and the safety concerns that a community may experience. You may have and of course, this is the section where it talks about what characteristics should be considered when allocating city resources for community planning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I thought that that was a an appropriate clarification. So I'll describe my amendment as amendment number two and I will move that would be adopted. Second case has been moved in. Second, to adopt amendment number two, any questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor say I. I oppose. The ayes have it. And before I hear Council Member Johnson or Councilmember O'Brien or others speak on the count plan, there's been at least some friendly outburst that there's a need for a public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fairness to those individuals, we had many folks sign up on the rental legislation and we only had an I didn't even get through. Maybe they're still 30 or 40% of the folks that I didn't get to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so they might have been at the bottom of list, which sometimes happened. So if one would like to move to vote on extending public comment on the comp plan, I would entertain that motion. If not, I will proceed without that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So moved and seconded. So it's been moved on. Second, and to extend public comment for the comp plan. All those in favor say I, I opposed the ayes have it. So why don't we give Kris and others a public comment sheet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what I'm going to try to multitask, I shall lay one out there on the comp plan. We're all saying, oh, well, okay, now I got to sort of go through six sheets, though, so I'll find it. And while I do that, Councilmember Johnson, why don't the council members have some dialog and we will have public comment'",
        "'speaker_0': 'before we vote. Okay. So did anyone else want to speak? Because I'm going to need a minute to go through this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Maybe I'll just sing a few bars about the thank you's before I speak to the underlying bill. So there's a lot of folks who put a lot of time and energy into this, not only this year, but over several years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I just want to lift up those folks who have spent a lot of time and energy with me on the comprehensive plan while you sort through all those sheets to try to identify which folks are going to come forward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I want to say thanks to Tom Hauger and Patrice Carroll, who are here in the audience from the Office of Planning and Community Development, and their bosses who now I'm going to start referring to as Sam and Diane, which I think is kind of a funny little alliteration that I didn't put together until today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But Sam, myself and Diane Narasaki, who I think have done a really great job of championing this through the last several years. Susie Levi from Councilmember O'Brien's office and Andrea Kranz from Councilmember Herbold office have spent countless hours working with us on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Eric McConaghy and Liz Whitson, who are unsung members of our council center staff, have helped shepherd us through several of these, and their supervisor, Carol Freeman, has been intimately involved in many discussions as well. And I'd be remiss if I didn't especially thank Amy Gore from my office, who has really been a rock on this topic, helped'",
        "'speaker_10': 'us not only get through, as I'll reiterate the ten discussions that we had on this topic in our committee, the eight discussions that we had on this topic and other committees, the two public hearings that we had on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that was just this year alone in the council process, let alone all the other public processes that we've had on this topic over the last four years. So I think we've spent a lot of time on the comp plan this year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the great thing about the comprehensive plan is that if you didn't get what you wanted this year, there's always next year because we take the comprehensive plan up every single year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Johnson. I'm going to do a little pivot strategy on the sign up sheet. It's just going to be hard for me to do that. So I'm just going to ask that you identify yourself and I will allow you 2 minutes in any order because I think we just have a handful of people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So because I can't go through all the sheets and there are more people that are not here than are here.'",
        "'speaker_5': '40 And I think most of us are like right after that. So look through 40 or 50.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well, let's just try it my way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I get 2 minutes. I'll do it in one. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to do it. Okay, that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good. Yeah. So on the comp plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your name.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please? Cindy Barker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cindy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At the plus meetings, I talked last time as I voted out about getting the comp plans, sausage making. Right. Well, I still think it's not quite right. It's pretty chunky at the moment. At the close meeting, there was literally pages and dozens of changes that were passed in in sweep.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They were not discussed in detail. And I understand that there was a need to focus on policy, but a lot of stuff got put in. So there was a lot of little discussion and the timing was very bad for the public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was a lot of input prior, but the amendments have been very confusing and our ability to give good comments when we have 1 minutes is very hard and we're not seeing our letters acknowledged, so we're not even sure if you're reading it and absorbing it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you should not pass this today. Those pledged changes need to be given a little more review, especially ones around concurrency in the form change and how how that concurrency is handled. Amendment One does show you what can be done with a little more time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Gaps were filled and community engagement made stronger, and I strongly support Lisa's improvement. But on your respective committees, you have to live with these results. You have to make the policy based on the comp plan. And I don't think you're seeing all the connections.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For example, if you allow housing on city open space, do you have to deduct that from the available land open space? That is in the complaint goals there. Just you don't have a coherent plan. We want a coherent, comprehensive plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Cindy. You're done. Correct. Yes, I done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm doing okay. That's right. And and I'm here to ask you today not to vote for the 2035 comprehensive plan. And I've got the materials, if you would care to review them in a huge hurry, illustrating the details of what's wrong with this thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's, I think, a severe lack of informed public consent that Sandy referred to. People like people like her know what's in it. But I think their input has been pervasively, thoroughly ignored. And the people who attend public hearings and stuff like that, they get a superficial presentation that avoids controversial elements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this very hearing canceled but then brought back when people are already on their way to work, kind of exemplifies that. They have to say this legislation is being advanced by the council faction, whose appreciation of Seattle public sentiment last week was cast into some question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it doesn't have to be signed up today. Thank you, Mr. Kaye. Chris?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chris Lehman. Go ahead. I see Chris Lieberman's name in here and I see. Colleen's name. Colleen is actually Colleen McAleer. Yes. I see you're way up there in 38. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for hearing our comments and thanks for allowing the extra time. Colleen McClure with Aloha Community Club. And we've been at this as long as you guys have been at this, as far as putting comments in to make it a really good plan to us, Seattle's growing and we're totally in favor of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The process, despite the fact that it seems to be going for two years, seems still a little bit rushed. Folks who are working during the days don't always have the opportunity to get in and comment at this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of amendments. A really good.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One that had or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Two that came out today were for those. The Flume process also needs to be retained because little up zones, the code, the way it's written says small things can get up soon for our neighborhood. We've lost a lot of affordable housing around Children's Hospital, which is used for families, students and lower income folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the burden is upon them and the flume process really does vet that. And so we are really anxious to retain that process. Any time you're changing affordable residential units of any type, we also are looking for more of the preservation of the urban tree canopy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Today we just signed on to the Urban Bird Treaty for the migrating birds. They live in trees and if we have legislation that's totally infilling backyards. Etc. Those happen to be gone for critters and disturbs the environment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Barking needs to be better balanced. Small businesses. People are running from door to door with house cleaning services, tradesmen. Those are the folks that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just need to present. That is an opportunity for them to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks for coming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Around for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Chris Lehman coming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Council president correctly stated that this meeting was canceled. Under state law, you cannot act on this comp plan ordinance. Use this opportunity to improve it as urged by the previous speakers and the public. And and most of you probably can't know that from what the mayor and the chair's propaganda say.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this repeals almost all of the comp plan. It even dropped the word sustainable from the title symbolically restored by your committee. But unfortunately, without putting back the repealed provisions that protect sustainability and livability, the once balanced urban village strategy becomes growth at any cost.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Repealed are policies against demolition and displacement, barriers to spot rezoning policies for real yards and large trees, and valuing parking as well as for mobility, safety and vitality. To say the least, this draft is not ready. It is unbalanced and and a new it is a new comp plan without the analysis, transparency and outreach associated with the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'associated with the original passage in 1994 for real outreach and needed improvements. Send it back. Do not act on it today. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Ward, according to bites at the apple, by the way, but as you point out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other one is a separate list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good. And a separate thing. So it's actually not. I think this would be a very sad day in Seattle if we passed the 2035 comprehensive plan to vastly change from the current plan, which was actually fairly changed from the previous plan, which gave a lot more benefits to to residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this will be a tremendous boon to developers. It'll make housing completely unaffordable, even for the first month's rent. Addressing the previous issue from earlier. It'll be completely unaffordable for most renters and increase homelessness substantially. So that's going to impact that issue as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for most homeowners, it will greatly increase taxes, which will increase gentrification in the South End as well. There are so many changes in the comp plan, hundreds and hundreds of pages many times that this woman spoke earlier about you couldn't understand it if you don't speak English.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But even for those of us who keep track of this was hundreds and hundreds of pages. We cannot keep track of that. So I suggest that you delay this just like you were delaying. Just please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sir.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Richard Ellis, and I'm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A homeowner in the Wedgewood community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Rob Johnson, for representing me. I'm here to talk about trees because the current comprehensive plan amendments basically try to neuter a lot of tree protection for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One councilmember, Mike O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is nothing in this at all in the when you talk about climate and climate change, it doesn't talk doesn't mention the word trees at all. If you look under climate, what we're going to do, you like my hat?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what we're trying to do. It says don't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do the track.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was just making sure I knew with the gist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of mention of trees in regards to carbon storage, urban island heat effects were stormwater runoff. Where's the beef when it comes to climate change? I mean, trees, urban forest are a big part of this and there's not even a mention in the comprehensive plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Other things. The language has changed. If you look in the language talks, instead of saying protect anymore, it says promote doesn't say protect trees. It says now promote trees. This is a neutering. The your own urban forestry commission has made a lot of recommendations hardly any have been installed in this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You have. Using golfers. Challenging things like acknowledged the need to balance industrial uses with environmental areas. The dormant greenbelt environmental justice issues related to the nearby residential areas which often have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, sir. Household can wrap up, please. Can you wrap up, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The point is, you're not even following your own Urban Forestry Commission that has been giving you recommendations. Have you read the recommendation? Why are they known as a very corporate?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you wrap up, please? Thank you very much, sir. I don't think I don't see any more public comment for the plan. Do any of my colleagues wish to discuss the matter any more? I'm don't saying I see two hands up as see consumer herbal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I just wanted to speak to the fact that Council Member Johnson's approach to deliberations around the comp plan and having each of the committees schedule time to discuss areas related to the comp plan that are relevant to our committee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Work gave me an opportunity to propose and successfully pass amendments that relate to work I'm responsible for. As I understand a public utilities work related to economic development, work related to arts, culture, music. So that was, I think, very, very a useful exercise to get greater engagement from from council members on the comp plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, guys. Herbal. Katherine Johnson, do you have any closing remarks? I think you said them, but if you'd like to, I'll give you one more opportunity here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just a few. That'd be great. Thank you. Council President. You know, one of the things that I think is critically different about the comprehensive plan after we spent a lot of time working on it in committee, is the community involvement element, which the original proposal Sundown did not have.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we spent a lot of time in committee talking about that community involvement element. And I appreciate the amendment that you brought forward today, Councilmember Herbold, because I do believe community involvement is going to be critical for us as we move forward and and really becoming the city that I know we want to become, the element that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we worked on stresses, outreach and engagement to a broader group of folks to ensure that we're hearing from in responding to historically underrepresented communities, which is critical. It's a creation of a totally new chapter, which I also think was critical and ensures that that chapter focuses on a coordinated, strategic approach, not just for all decision making in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the city, not just for land use and transportation and parks and open space, but everything that we think will determine and impact people's lives. It's got some really important changes to help us to continue to address climate change, including a goal of increasing our trees canopy, which was not included in any of our previous comprehensive plans and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'many policies, updating our approach to transportation to help keep people and goods moving safely and reduce our reliance on single occupancy vehicles. It includes goals and policies to implement many of the hollow recommendations around addressing for our affordable housing crisis, including policies to help us track and mitigate displacement, allowing for more flexibility in urban villages and basing'",
        "'speaker_10': 'growth estimates on transit access and displacement, which we can use to mitigate negative growth impacts in areas that risk displacement. It does not include the boundary changes that were proposed and are still being discussed by the Harlow focus groups, as well as the neighborhood boundary workshops that many of my colleagues are aware of.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It also does not include the implementation of proposed zoning changes to increase heights in urban villages. Both of those changes are going to be coming as part of next year's process. We've got a full nine months to a year to continue to work on those boundary changes and zoning changes within urban villages.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The last thing that I would say is I'm really proud as a fifth generation Seattle, out of the work that Councilmember Herbold and I did to help protect the assets that make Seattle really unique, the strategies for increasing open space and parks in innovative ways and work to preserve and inventory cultural and historic assets, I think are'",
        "'speaker_10': 'going to be really critical as we continue to see a growth and an influx of folks in this city. As a fifth generation Seattle, I'm really proud of the work that we're doing to really respond to the pressures of growth in a way that is inclusive but also recognizes our city's history.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that this council process promise, though not perfect, according to many members of the public, I think has been a great step forward. So I encourage my colleagues to vote yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. If there are no further comments, please call the role on the passage of the Bill O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi Swan. I beg pardon. Burgess Gonzalez I hi Juarez I Herbold I President Harrell. I am favored on a post.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bill passed in the chair was sign it we've gone through. Margin items. Is there any further business to come for the council? I'm seeing that. So for that, we stand adjourned. Thank you. Have a great day.'"
