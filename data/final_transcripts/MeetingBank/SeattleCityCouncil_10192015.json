    "A RESOLUTION opposing Washington Initiative Measure 1366 and urging Seattle voters to vote no on Initiative 1366 on the November 3, 2015 general election ballot.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'Agenda item one, resolution 31623. Opposing Washington initiative measure 1366 and urging Seattle voters to vote no on Initiative 1366 on the November 3rd, 2015 General Election Ballot Introduced October 12th, 2015.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I move to adopt resolution 31623. It's moved in second. And if the resolution be adopted, we will now hear comments from council members in support of this resolution. Are there any comments? This resolution is on the November 3rd general election ballot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is somewhat complicated, but it is a resolution that would mandate that the state legislature take action on tax matters or impose a two thirds majority vote requirement. This, if adopted, this initiative could cost the taxpayers of Washington State up to $8 billion over the next six years, primarily for funding of education and other essential services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would block reform of our tax system, which is one of the most regressive in the United States. The initiative is opposed by both Democrats and Republicans in the state of Washington. And by adopting this resolution, we urge the voters of Seattle to oppose Initiative 1366.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any other comments from council members? Council members who want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Brian Burgess. Just to make it clear, a vote of yes on this resolution is would be advocating for no on the statewide initiative. I strongly support this resolution. The initiative would set unnecessary restrictions on new taxes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These restrictions are particularly problematic because of the existing tax structure in the state, which is the most progressive in the nation, and particularly the fact that the sales tax, which is at the moment the backbone of tax revenues in the state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Taxes, poor and working class people far more than rich people and corporations. In this initiative, there are even exemptions to the sales tax specially built in for corporations. For example, there is an exemption for chemical fertilizer and an exemption for jet fuel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, what regular person is buying massive amounts of jet fuel? Boeing buys jet fuel. I doubt if any of us has ever bought jet fuel. I mean, if you own an aircraft, maybe you do. So this initiative is really designed to stop us from beginning to shift the tax burden off the backs of regular people and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'onto the super rich and big business. And I fully support a council resolution objecting to that and urging voters to reject the initiative. It also should be added, though, that our state legislature, regardless of which major political party establishment has been in control of it, has totally failed to pass progressive taxation measures even without this outrageous restriction'",
        "'speaker_5': 'going forward. So we should oppose this restriction because we should oppose further hurdles being put in the way of taxing the wealthy. But we should not let current lawmakers off the hook for their failure to act so far.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the best way to do it is to hold city officials accountable so that we can push for every possible progressive revenue option at the city level to push on the state. And let's all oppose this Dim Omen initiative.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We'll now hear comments from council members in opposition to the resolution. Are there any comments? We will take comments from the public. Now I wish to speak in opposition or support of the resolution. How much time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll take comments for 6 minutes. Speakers will alternate between opponents and proponents of the resolution until the 6 minutes have expired. We'll begin with someone in favor of the resolution. Paula Revere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Thanks again for a chance to speak. These initiatives are look like random moneymaking schemes. They really aren't. This is a way of really strangling the legislature. And we've already been strangled with that income tax, which I could show someone listen long enough that the people in the state of Washington want an income tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are certain millionaires that don't. And there are other states that support that same nonsense. So we have to live on very little money in this state, and it's constantly being squeezed every legislative session. And now we'll be losing our schools eventually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you look at Chicago and Detroit and have charter schools and basically it's it's a way of starving the life out of representative government. Which takes us back to the Treaty of Verona, November 22nd, 1822. They celebrated on the day that President Kennedy was killed because he fought the most representative government when he impeached the Federal Reserve'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and issued silver certificates and silver dollars. So Tim, I'm in is definitely an enemy in that respect. The problem is that people don't get the whole story and they may vote for it just because it doesn't look like a big deal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's a shame. With my 37 seconds left, I wanted to share with you that the person that runs the TPP, Mr. from is the same person who started the Democratic Leadership Council out of Arkansas and brought in Mr. Clinton, who was not a Democrat and brought him into running for election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And he's the one that signed Douma and he's also the one that did the Crime Act, and he's also the one that killed the Commerce Protection Act, and he's also the one that killed the Steagall Act. So keep your eyes open and don't let your memory forget what's really been happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. In order to get more speakers and we're going to shift to one minute of comment in opposition to the resolution. Paul W lock.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Paul W Lock. We should do anything we can to restrict giving you more money to spend. Absolutely. We're not getting anything of value. Creating a bureaucracy. That's nothing yourself. Fancy salaries, staffs, you name it. It could go through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could be a two thirds vote. To raise taxes. We can't afford it. But the majority of the population in this city living off the rest of us. It just running out of people to pay the bills. In California, the richest man moved to Australia.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Help them. Billions of dollars in income came into them. People want money. There's been things that make things better. You're still applying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. In favor of the resolution. Good space guy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good dog ish, I say. Good space guy. And this initiative from Tim Iman. Tim Iman is one of good space guys heroes. So I have a lot of role models. Tim Iman is one of them. Third State Initiative Measure 1366 has the potential of lowering the sales tax from six and a half percent to five and a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'half percent. This would be very good if you support the exchange economy, the capitalistic, free market exchange economy that makes the customer the king. So when you tax something, you decrease it. So by having a high sales tax, we decrease the exchange economy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People decide, well, I am not going to be involved in exchange economy. I'm going to do things myself or I'm going to abstain. But if we put low taxes on the exchange economy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'New York Times. You actually signed up on the wrong sheet. So is there anyone who wants to speak in favor of the council's resolution? Yes. Are you Sarah? Great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sheet as well. Good afternoon, council members. Thank you for your resolution. Encouraging a no on initiative 1366. My name is Sarah Kessler with Fuze, Washington, representing the broad bipartisan Coalition of Leaders Opposing Initiative. 1366. 1366 is the latest attempt by Tim Simon and his corporate backers to force state lawmakers into passing a constitutional amendment that would lock'",
        "'speaker_2': 'into place a two thirds majority to raise revenue or close unnecessary tax loopholes. If both the Washington State House and Senate do not comply with Iman's demanded constitutional amendment 1366 could cut about $8 billion from our state's education, emergency services, parks and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That makes our state a great place to live. This proposal is a lose lose for Washington. Either we cut billions of dollars from education or we permanently lock into place our state's upside down, regressive tax system. And closing our state's constitution is not a toy to play with.'",
        "'speaker_2': '1366 is so flawed it will likely be found unconstitutional.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Our last speaker will be lacrosse. A green.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm glad I didn't prepare a two minute speech, but I don't have anyone either. I come here to ask your consideration. I don't appreciate somebody telling me how to vote. And when you gang up as a bloc and wanting us to vote one way or the other, you are saying that you have better judgment than the rest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of us. You don't tell a grown adult what to do. You may ask are you may suggest. But you can't tell them what to do. I don't appreciate you doing this. And also, I don't appreciate you coming up here and saying at Black Lives Matters when you're here supporting killing unborn children.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's something wrong here. And I would appreciate you considering that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We'll now vote on resolution 31623, which opposes state initiative 1366. Those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I. Those opposed vote no. The resolution is unanimously adopted in the chair will sign it. The report of the Transportation Committee.'",

The committee recommends a divided report with a recommendation to that the bill pass, as amended by councilmembers Rasmussen, Burgess, Gordon Okamoto and a recommendation to not pass by council members O'Brien and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'so on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. The majority opinion goes first with divided reports. So, Councilmember Rasmussen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. This bill establishes the heavy haul network in the SODO area. The network will be a series of 26 streets that freight will use to haul sealed containers from ships at the port to nearby shipping facilities in the Sodo and West Thomas area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, our streets have an 80,000 weight limit. Trucking companies, shippers or independent drivers wishing to transport containers over that 80,000 weight limit either have to carry the containers on trucks that are outfitted with special expensive chassis designed to distribute the weight over the additional axles or break the law and exceed the weight limit with using standard chassis'",
        "'speaker_4': '. As we've already heard from one of the drivers about the the high costs of any fine that may be related if you're caught breaking the law and the load limit. With this legislation and the agreement that's attached to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Trucks with permits will be able to carry freight weighing up to 98,000 on standard houses on roads that are part of the network. The drivers will pay a $200 annual permit that allows them to move heavy hauls within the network permit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Revenues will help pay for an additional commercial vehicle enforcement officer to ensure the proper use of the corridor. Drivers will be required to undergo twice annual commercial vehicle safety inspections, and as I said earlier, only sealed oceangoing containers will be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'General traffic will be allowed still on those roads. In the heavy haul network, the Department of Transportation and Port Engineers estimate that the heavy haul roads would deteriorate faster by 10% faster than if they were carrying weight within the 80,000 limit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The exact level that would be required for a contribution from the port to the city to help pay for these additional costs will depend upon future studies to determine the impact of the heavy hauls. But it's anticipated that the costs for additional maintenance will be between ten and $20 million over the next 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of this is provided for in the Council Bill itself and the memorandum of understanding that is attached to the Council Bill. So overall, with the memorandum of agreement and the legislation, the result is that it eliminates truck driver citations from our state patrol and increases vehicle safety by requiring twice yearly vehicle inspections.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It adds a new commercial vehicle enforcement officer to enhance safety compliance. The Port of Seattle and our maritime industry, which are major employers in the region and an important part of our economy, will remain competitive. As you know, the port is in a fiercely competitive market for cargo.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we don't allow the heavier loads on these streets, they'll go to other ports, including nearby Tacoma, Los Angeles and Long Beach, which already have heavy haul corridors. There was some concern. And we do know that there is a divided report on this about issues relating to the port.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the ones that came up. Was the issue of providing adequate bathrooms for the drivers at the port 18 terminals, port 18 terminals. This issue has been an ongoing dispute some time between the drivers and the port.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm happy to announce that the city, the port and representatives of the drivers have worked out an agreement with regard to the condition of the bathrooms, in the bathrooms that will be provided. And that in agreement includes the commitment by the port to refurbish two existing restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The port will have the three new portable restrooms for drivers and also additional parking stalls so that the drivers can access other restrooms safely. So overall, with the agreement between the port and the drivers, as well as this legislation and the memorandum of agreement, we have a win win for the port, for US competitiveness and the many'",
        "'speaker_4': 'jobs that depend upon the port for Seattle, which depends in part upon the port success for the survival of our economy, and also the drivers who we've heard from at times over the course of the development of this legislation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would like to thank the port for their partnership and for their understanding and working on the issue related to the restrooms and also with regard to our need for better maintenance of our streets and to members of staff, including Brian Seward of the Office of Economic Development and Rockey of the Office of Economic Development.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I am the author of The Minority Report. And I'm in the in your position of having getting to say that the work that's been done in the last few weeks has allowed me to feel much more comfortable with this legislation and so I'll be supporting it at the committee raised a lot of it raised a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'lot of concerns about a number of issues, specifically around low wage workers and drivers and talked a lot about wanting to see a commitment to making sure that the bathroom facilities at terminal 18 we're going to be acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to thank Councilmember Rasmussen and Council President Burgess for holding this legislation for a couple of weeks to allow for some really good work to have happen. I want to thank the Port of Seattle and folks from the executive side and Office Economic Development for working very hard in the last couple of weeks to reach an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'agreement on how we can move forward on providing those bathrooms at Terminal 18. The commitment is what I've been hearing from the truck drivers that they want to see, and I'm really thrilled that we're at a place where we are today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, it's a commitment. The bathrooms aren't in place. But I've heard from port commissioners Albo and Gregoire today that they take this commitment seriously and we're going to work in a timely, expedited fashion to make sure that the work follows through so the drivers will actually have the facilities they've been hoping for for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, I want to I want to thank the port especially for the specifics on this. And I look forward to opportunities to continue to work together as a region to make sure we have a robust economy and to make sure, especially those lowest wage workers are being treated fairly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think what was demonstrated in the last couple of weeks was a real a real commitment towards that values. And I really appreciate that. So I will be voting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes on this. Thank you. Councilmember So on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. President Burgess. I concur with the points Councilmember Brian made, except just one correction. The Minority Report was coauthored by on Tim O'Brien and me. And when this special permit for a heavy haul network came up for a vote in committee, we voted no because the Teamsters Union that has been organizing and fighting alongside the port'",
        "'speaker_5': 'truckers pointed out that there were significant and there are still significant worker rights issues that need to be addressed. The lack of access to bathrooms is one of them and a really urgent one. I want everybody in the public to know that do know how impactful taking your vote seriously.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Elected officials taking their vote seriously can be because after this Minority Report was issued, there was some movement from the port commissioners who wanted this memorandum memorandum of understanding and began to show willingness for the first time, in my experience, to do something about the long needed bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's an example of how, contrary to what the corporate media says, you know, when you vote no, you're grandstanding. In reality, if elected officials take their yes or no vote on these issues seriously, then rather than rubber stamping the status quo, they can actually get some movement on these issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. This change will also now vote yes on the contract. Although the caution is the bathrooms have been promised, they haven't been delivered yet and we will need to remain vigilant that they follow through on that and also follow through on other remaining worker rights issues.'",
