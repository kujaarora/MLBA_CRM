        "'speaker_3': 'It means that we will be funding a public safety coordinator, and it also means that we will be funding public safety surveys that are culturally and linguistically competent for the residents and workers in that particular neighborhood.

        "'speaker_3': 'investing $400,000 over the next two years in improvements to that green space in the Chinatown International District around housing. I'm really proud that this budget reflects a $100,000 investment to fund an affordable housing needs assessment analysis for LGBTQ seniors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it also allocates resources for development of a homeless youth housing project to ensure some of our most vulnerable neighbors have access to stable housing and the services they need.

And just want to highlight a couple of things that I think were some central points for me through this budget process. I come into this with a background in urban planning and policy, and I really was looking at this in sort of four main ways.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The first of which is how do we foster community through our budgeting process? And there are a lot of different ways that we did that. But I want to call out a couple of things that I think are really critically important to fostering community funding for additional lights for our parks and recreation departments to light athletic fields'",

        "'speaker_7': 'our city and continue to make us economically competitive, I think is going to be really great, as well as a really wonderful small project around activation of King Street, which I think is going to be a really wonderful addition to our community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That element of fostering community, I think is critical. We also, I think, put a strong emphasis on making the city more affordable. We did that in a couple of different ways. I know my colleague, Councilmember Herbold, is going to talk about the bonding capacity for more affordable housing, which I think is important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also put some money into relocation assistance for folks in a soon to closed trailer park in the university. It's called the University Trailer Park. It's just off of Lake City in Councilmember Suarez's district. I think that's going to be really important, as well as putting money into the creation of affordable housing on city owned land or'",
        "'speaker_7': 'publicly owned land. We've got some money in the budget for really advancing feasibility work for those projects, as well as funding specifically for Northgate, which I know Councilmember Wahls will talk about as well. Transportation choices, an expansion of the public safety.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And our public right away is critical to me. And many of my colleagues put projects in the budget to advance public safety on roadways in their districts, and there are so many that it's too many to call out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I'm really grateful for the backing that many of my colleagues put towards making our roadways safer for everybody, especially Councilmember O'Brien for the work on advancing funding for the bike master plan projects. I think that that's going to be really critical as we continue to try to make our our streets safer for everybody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Councilmember Burgess, really the call out for my old mentor, Don Shoup, and the work they've done on parking benefit districts. I'm really grateful to you for continuing to keep that project alive. Finally supporting kids and families. Councilmember Burgess, you did a good job of outlining many of the programs, and I know you'll talk Council President Harrell'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about the 13th year program, but a couple of small things that I think are really important for us. We put some money into that child care mitigation fund, which we've talked about a lot this morning. And I also want to say a big thank you to my colleagues for their investment in the backpack programs for kids, which'",
        "'speaker_7': 'over the next couple of years will ensure that every kid who needs it goes home over the weekends with a backpack full of food so they can come back on Monday ready to learn. Many of those kids don't have access to food over the weekends, not only just for them, but for their siblings and other family members'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And that's a critical investment in human services that I think will really bear good dividends for us in the long run. Finally, I just want to say thank you to many of my colleagues who during this budget process, worked so hard to invest and of course, that are values that reflect a commitment to equity and access.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Support for infrastructure for our growing community kept a vigilant focus on the creation of affordable housing, who improved pedestrian and bike safety on public rights of way and so meaningfully invested in our next generation.

        "'speaker_3': 'As it relates specifically to items in that fall, under my committee bailiwick, we funded hearing loops for the Boards and commissions room to ensure accessibility for those with hearing disabilities.

        "'speaker_3': '. I think the there are there are many different options that we can pursue. And I look forward to working both with the Office of Housing, the mayor's office, the the city budget office, as well as council members on identifying how we want to roll this out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whether or not we want to look at a single project or or many projects, I think some of the things that we've talked about in budget can range from the funding for the Hopes and Homes Project, specifically identifying ways of funding the development of new housing on publicly owned land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But whatever we choose, I hope we choose something that is both cost effective and an expedient. The need is is great. And my my hope is that we don't just simply look at funding the sort of bricks and mortar type of new development proposals that this this particular proposal has been compared to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's really that's really it. The the my closing bit is to thank the folks in my office who have toiled on these budget ads.

        "'speaker_6': 'While I cannot support the budget as a whole, I do want to acknowledge the progress that the people's budget movement and the Coalition to build 1000 homes have made. Over the last month we restored the funding to the lead program, which is an alternative to incarcerating people that the mayor cut from his budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want more funding for programs serving survivors of domestic violence. Funding for food for kids and increased shelter. Hours for homeless people.

        "'speaker_6': 'the police bunker in the north. While 29 million is only 18% of 160 million. And we should ask the question, why did the council not have the political will to fund the whole project? It would be a mistake to underestimate how important this victory is.'",
        "'speaker_6': '$29 million is a lot of money, and it is going to support the most burning need we have in Seattle to date. It will mean about at least more 200 more affordable units. That means if you look at it from human terms, almost 200 families with a home and it will be all the difference to them.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'my view, is completely unnecessary. Ah, the note that we have to make for our movement is that the outcomes in politics depend on the balance of power between our movement and the level of opposition from the establishment. So a sober reflection is that a stronger movement could have forced more council members into prioritizing housing over the bunker'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But we should also also note our victory that the movement was strong enough to force the establishment to do something they had swore to never do, which is use bonds for housing. And this is not a small thing.'",

We should take heart from victories such as these. When we build a mass and united movement, we can win things that seemed unimaginable a couple of months ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is how we won $15 an hour, and that is how we won these $29 million. That is how we can defeat Wall Street interest and also Trump's agenda. So once again, thank you to all the dedicated activists in the people's budget movement and the Thousand Homes Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have demonstrated how movements can win victories. I raised this because as I vote no on the budget as a whole, it is very important we lose we not lose sight of what we have won through our movement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will vote no on the budget by voting no on this item and the next agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Swatch. Councilmember O'Brien.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Colleagues, you've all said a lot of great things and I agree with a lot of it and I am ready to vote yes, man.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, leadership these days, the brevity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, if I see a speech, I would like to just say a few words, but I won't be nearly as brief as is. Councilmember O'Brien. One thing about a budget process, any budget process is it largely also tells you what you can't afford.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's a bad part about a budget. But it also doesn't prevent you from trying to do the best you could. And I hope that this council years from now will not be judged by the mistakes you've made or what you didn't see, but really by what you tried to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I have to tell you, this is far from business as usual. There are unprecedented and uninvestigated areas that this particular budget aggressively tries to invest in. And I want to say to the advocates for the community centers as an example, this is not the end of anything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have supplemental budgets. We have legislation from the council. We have our superintendent of parks here watching us deliberate in this particular budget. As an example, we are investing $1.5 million in the 13th year Promise Scholarship program, which means kids with GPAs at a25 to 6 to 7 GPA, which we know are falling through the cracks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're not getting in the greatest schools because for whatever reason, they don't have a38 GPA. We are investing in that demographic and saying there's hope and we're trying to get you on a better path. We're investing $6.5 million in an equitable development implementation plan that goes to the Rainier Beach Innovation District, a multicultural community center, a Southeast'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Economic Opportunity Center, the William Groves Center for Culture. Innovation, Little Saigon Landmark Project. These are real investments in communities that have largely been overlooked by the powers that be. We are investing $1,000,000 in unprecedented educational opportunities, a high school innovation pilot program, a summer learning expansion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Realizing these kids drop off, sometimes it right after high school and during the summer or during high school, during the summer experienced a summer melt program. And a summer melt is not a it's not a cheese sandwich or anything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The summer melt program recognizes that a lot of kids actually get accepted to schools and then they fail to show up. They fail to show up because they get intimidated. They have other problems. And the drop off, particularly on underrepresented groups, is very, very significant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're investing $100,000 to identifying these kids and finding out why they are dropping off. We have $200,000 in to 2017 and $1.8 million in 2018 for a community service officer. CSO Program. You may recall why CSOs, the ERA, the very bloody civil rights era that the CSOs were invented, we recognize, is that in public safety we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have to have people coming from the communities that they serve. We have to there's no excuse for it not to be. And so in addition to looking and reevaluating how we recruit police officers and firefighters, we are creating or recreating this community service position, which is, again, intended to be a liaison, if you will, people from the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community helping us better serve the community. This pre filing diversion efforts that we're doing, 407,000 in 2017 and over 660,000, 2018. What what that's about is when a kid, like many of the kids that I grew up with, become knuckleheads.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they do something stupid. They have an arrest record on their on their record or they are prosecuted with idiotic crimes. They are around the wrong people at the wrong time. And we're recognizing that through our judges, through our prosecutors, through our law department, through things we have control over there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can help change lives and rebuild many of these youth. The $29 million for long term city bonds that many of us, I think, were rightfully critical in terms of this being unprecedented. However, we stepped up and said, you know, and I said, sometimes when there's a crisis, you may do things perhaps that are traditionally unwise or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'imprudent, but often the right thing to do. So I think this is an outstanding budget. And I want to thank Councilmember Burgess for and Kirsten, I don't know if it came from from Kirsten Aristotle or Councilmember Burgess. I don't really care.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The work was outstanding. And I want to thank you both because it was a transparent process. You worked incredibly hard and I won't do what Councilmember Burgess did was go through all the names of central staff, but I will recognize Jennifer Samuels visiting Jeremy Rock and Chase Monroe from my staff because they worked feverishly as well, trying'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to make sure that we got some things that we felt pretty passionate about. I also want to thank the mayor, the mayor and his department heads, because quite candidly, they put forth some investments in this budget that really gave us, I think, a good template to work from, not to in a sense, in a preposition, but that's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly what they did. And I think that they worked again collaboratively prior to the budget process, talking to many of my colleagues, figuring out figuring this out before it had gotten to us and Ben Nobles and others, I want to thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm not going to recognize many department heads, but I want to tell you, Dwayne Chappelle in our Education Department, I think is a is a superstar. And again, working with this educational summit, looking at our deficiencies and coming up with new ideas on how to address the the disparity in education, I think was phenomenal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm excited about this budget. I think we did the hard work in the in the easy work, as you're saying, is deficient. The hard work is finding out how we could think better to serve people better. And this is not the end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the beginning of implementation. And we're going to have many opportunities next year to improve on these investments. So I can't thank my colleagues enough. And I think I, I said all the comments that I want to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think we are ready to vote. So it's been introduced. It's been described. I will make sure I don't see any hands fly up. And having said that, please call the role on Council Bill 118849.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Herbold Hi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Johnson Suarez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'O'Brien Hi.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And this is a time where we clap among ourselves. Good work, colleagues. Thank you very much. We shall have a little business to do. Let's see. We don't have any other resolutions to adopt at. But, uh, Chair Burgess, I think you have a matter on other business you may want to address.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I'd like to. I move to rescind my absence on December 16.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been moved in segment that council member Burgess's absence from December 16 be rescinded. All those in favor say I. I oppose. The ayes have it. Any further business come before the council?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Herbold? Yes. I'm asking to be excused from the November 28th full council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What date was that again? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'November 28, November 20th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got it. And it's been to those in favor of excuse, Councilmember Herbold, for November 28th. Say, I, I opposed. The ayes have it. She is excused for 1128. Any other council member. So what?'",

Any other business? Okay, with that, we will just let you know we going to move into the Parks District, so we're going to keep the cameras rolling.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm going to adjourn this meeting and we're just going to not get up. We're going to proceed with our Parks District proceeding so the full council stands adjourned and we are going to now convene as a parks.'"
