        "'speaker_2': 'And that will allow the council to to really keep an eye on on how overtime is is is being deployed in an effort to do necessary course correction in future deployment of overtime. Secondly, the Council has requested that CPD provide monthly fiscal reporting beginning in January 2021.'",

Beyond beyond this action here today to consider what specifics we might we might need to really focus on in these in these monthly reports, whether or not that's total spending to date by budget control level.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So how will volunteer organizers be made aware of their responsibilities? How should volunteers track donations thrown in the buckets of protest, which is a common strategy for grassroots fundraising? There are no answers to any of these questions yet, and I understand the concept for these rules is more around corporate advertising campaigns, like when the soda industry runs'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ads against a sweetened beverage tax. But the sad reality is that it will have it will create a chilling effect on community organizing by burying them in red tape. And the disclosure will be easy for those for the corporations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They already have accountants and batteries of attorneys to make it trivial for them to complete the paperwork, and it will be the volunteer organizers that will be penalized. Finally, I also understand that this language has been taken word for word, almost word for word from the state laws regulating grassroots campaign targeting the state government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, the state regulations are the last place I would look for advice on how to create a welcoming environment for grassroots organizing. Olympia is notoriously inaccessible to ordinary people, not necessarily because of this rule particularly, but I think the disregard this law will have for grassroots organizing is emblematic of that problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The amendment. My office is prepared and I thank central staff. Send for getting it ready rapidly. What got from the billion dollar sexual and grassroots campaigns and would leave the other two issues taken up by the bill unchanged.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If this amendment fails, I will be voting no on the bill as a whole, not because I object to those other two issues, but because, on balance, without this amendment, the bill would be an attack on grassroots organizing and would not, on balance, benefit ordinary people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we need to be clear. Mass movements have been the source of every progressive change in the history of this country, including the recent developments like the $15 minimum wage and the Amazon tax. I'm not surprised that the political establishment is so eager to gather the information of grassroots organizers because movement building succeeds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also reject the false dichotomy that has been presented that when governments are going to prison. Gonzalez spoke to this in the briefing this morning. She said that this does not affect people who call in or emailed the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It only affects organizers. Well, because our movements are only successful when we get organized. It's as simple as that. So essentially, the council is saying that you're fine if you call or email as individuals, which often has zero impact on political outcomes unless you're a CEO or a wealthy person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you succeed in getting organized enough among yourselves to be effective as ordinary people, then the political establishment wants to know who you are and what you are doing. I think we need to understand that that's what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Finally, socialists and rank and file labor should remember the McCarthy era, the Red Scare, the blacklist, the political establishment demanding the information of genuine grassroots organizing has throughout history been used again and again to attack the mass movements of regular people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if the council approves this law, it will be just another step towards, you know, really creating hindrances to grassroots organizing during critical movements in future struggles. I urge council members to support this amendment. And as I said, if it fails, I will be voting no on the bill as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Colleagues. Any additional comments on Amendment one?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would just say really quickly that I do oppose Amendment One. And I think that it's unfortunate that there's been such a mischaracterization of what the indirect lobbying portion of the underlying bill actually does. There is nothing in the council bill that is before the city council that that would in any way, shape or form lead a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'reasonable person to conclude that folks who engage in protest movement, organizing protest movements or organizing work would suddenly become lobbyists. Under this particular legislation, I think the bill is pretty clear in defining who a lobbyist is. It talks about how a lobbying entity is a law firm, consulting firm, public relations firm, or other similar organization that engages'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in lobbying through its employees or agents. It defines a lobbyist as an any individual who lobbies for compensation except individuals who might be reimbursed for minor incidental personal expenses related to that lobbying. It defines a lobbyist employer as any person who employs or compensates a lobbyist or a lobbying entity for lobbying to promote the person's interests.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, this particular legislation is specifically targeted towards those individuals who are professional lobbyists. There's nothing in this bill that targets organizers as we know them to be. In fact, this simply says that if if, if, if there is a lobbyist who is compensated for the lobbying activity and those lobbyists are sponsoring public campaigns to influence legislation'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at city council or at the city as a whole, whether through direct communication to council members, in direct communication to council members or the mayor's office or their directors, department directors or those deputy directors, then they are simply required to disclose that activity and their expenditures related to those activities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, we are taking a careful approach here through and through Amendment two, which we'll discuss if this amendment fails. If this amendment passes, the amendment to will not be on the table because amendment to would amend the indirect lobbying portion of the Council bill as passed out of committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But amendment to makes very clear that this does not cover any communications from organizations to their members. And that was an important that's an important amendment to respond to concerns from nonprofit organizations and other small organizations who don't want to be put in a position and shouldn't be put in a position to have to communicate, to have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to disclose every time they send out an email blast, for example, to their member list around a particular around a particular issue. So so I will go ahead and link up. Okay. Sorry. Go ahead. Councilman ROSQUETA, please. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam President. I did abstain on this vote in committee. And I think that the concerns that I had are addressed by the amendment that your office is bringing forward to address the underlying concern about engagement with various members and making sure that grassroots, grassroots lobbying and those organizations that provide that vital service can clearly see that that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is not only prohibited, permitted activities, but encouraged as we want, as we seek to get information directly from individuals affected by policy decisions. So thank you, Madam President, for bringing forward your amendment, because that is being brought forward today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am not going to be supporting this amendment that we're currently discussing, but we'll be supporting your amendment to your bill. And that addresses my concerns that I think you can sometimes get. And I appreciate the the back and forth we had in committee that was about about that particular issue and was happy that we were able'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to work with some organizing folks and organizations and community to make sure that we could bring forward that membership exemption, which does exist in state law, but unfortunately haven't made it into the base city bill. So I think this is an improvement on the original bill as it was introduced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So okay, right now we are considering Amendment One, which is the amendment as a sponsored and for. Hosted by council member the wants hearing no additional comments on Amendment one. We're going to go ahead and ask the clerk to please call the role on the adoption of Amendment one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So aren't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Strauss. No problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas now you talk at. Lewis. Oh. Morales. Well. No. ROSQUETA. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'PETERSON No. Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'President Gonzalez no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One in favor. Eight opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion fails. The amendment is not adopted and the bill is before the Council. I will now move to amend Council Bill 119968 as presented on Amendment two, which was recently distributed. Is there a second? Second. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment two as sponsor of this amendment. I'll go ahead and just recap really quickly, because I know we've been discussing it what it does. So Amendment two again would make council Bill 119968 more consistent with the state's law on lobbying activities by exempting internal membership communications'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And again, this amendment would, with this amendment, the sale efforts and Elections Commission will be tasked with a public process in defining membership. This can look like a number of things like dues paying, being a voting member, electing leadership, and by not being prescriptive in the legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this moment, we will allow CSC some flexibility in how they define this in their rulemaking process with the benefit of having public input. So again, colleagues, I think that this amendment, too, does address some of the concerns that we heard through additional engagement and conversation in committee around how excuse me, how organizations who have memberships are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'going to be able to continue to communicate with those members without without being subjected to cumbersome disclosure requirements in the new lobbying regulations. I do believe that this amendment does address those concerns with the understanding that there will be a period of six months in 2021 where the Senate Ethics and Elections Commission is going to engage in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'public education and additional community public input processes. And then they Director Burnet, indicated to us in committee that they are looking at taking a compliance first approach here. So they're not looking to have this be a gotcha kind of piece of legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They want they want to encourage compliance and they want to educate folks in in how to comply. And that's that's the approach they're going to take as they go through initially implementing this particular component of the bill. So with that being said, I would strongly encourage folks to support Amendment two as an improvement to the bill as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'introduced and discussed in committee. Are there any additional comments on Amendment two? Councilmember Morales, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. I do have several questions. I'm going to try to lump them together and see if we can do this quickly. Mm hmm. So I have a question about, you know, we've been working lately, especially with a lot of coalitions and that are it's kind of a mix of organizations that are mostly volunteer based and some organizations'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that do have staff that have a paid staff to help with some of their work. And so I'm wondering what this means for coalitions. And I think this is related, but also trying to understand if there is a distinction between how nonprofit organizations would be impacted by this and for profit organizations that might be coming to council'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with things that they're trying to do. Mm hmm. That'll be a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. On the one on the last point around for profit and nonprofit, the lobbying regulations as a whole don't distinguish between whether you're a for profit or a nonprofit. It's about the status of the person who is doing the the lobbying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So there's there are several triggers. If you look at the at the underlying bill that really sort of walk through what what the first threshold is, are you a lobbyist? If you're not a lobbyist, meaning that you're not paid to engage in lobbying behavior, then it that nothing else matters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a it's nothing is going to change for you. But if you meet the definition of lobbying and then and then and being a lobbyist, then you have to register as such. And if you engage in sponsoring campaigns for $750 a month or $1,500 over a period of three months, then that means that you would have to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'disclose your lobbying activity along with your expenditures related to whatever. Public campaign you launched to influence legislation. So. So there isn't a distinction in terms of if you're for profit, it's not about the issue or the content of your speech.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's about it's about whether or not you meet the definitional criteria of lobbyists and the expenditure requirement necessary to to to rise to the to to the next level. There is we did specifically because we were concerned about how coalitions work together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's part of the reason why we reached out to to Julia from this get all human services coalition to to ask her specifically if she had any concerns around the the indirect lobbying portions of this bill. Understanding that that she has a very large coalition of organizations who come together to to request particular outcomes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so so we did receive some responses from the Ethics and Elections Commission that were related to how do we how do we address some of those particular concerns? And I'm pulling it up now in just a minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So some of the primary concerns really related to how they use their mailing list, which was a primary form of how coalitions engage with each other and how they activate people who are part of those mailing lists and so on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with the exemption, with communications with members, which is this amendment, then people who have the capacity to, for example, vote for an organization's director or who pay dues, etc., would not be subjected to the indirect lobbying requirement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So without this amendment, it would trigger disclosure requirements for for even coalition organizations. So I'm happy to share this email with you. After the fact, there's a there are probably about a dozen questions that were posed by Julia that we had Wayne answered that we then shared the answers with Julia about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but I think it also it also is important for us to remember that when we're talking about presenting a program, according to Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission, really traditionally what that means is using things like paid social media, paid billboards or other means of paid communication to encourage people to contact their elected officials and urge them'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to either support or oppose a piece of legislation. So, again, if a coalition is is is meeting the expenditure requirements, is communicating outside of their membership list and is and meets the definition of lobbyists, then they would they would be required to to file a disclosure that would include expenditure disclosures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So that probably answers my next question, which is that we do hear often from, you know, some of our most marginalized communities, you know, formerly incarcerated sex workers, folks who are undocumented. And so in order to make sure that they are protected.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, that was my concern. But it sounds like if they're not registered as a lobbyist or wouldn't fall under that definition, then that that's sort of a moot point anyway, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Yeah. The first threshold is, are you a lobbyist engaging in compensated lobbying work? And then are you expanding the required minimal amounts in order to trigger the disclosure? So even lobbyists who spend less than 750 a month or less than 1515 hundred dollars in a three month period, wouldn't be required to to do disclosures.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, again, I think I think this is a new framework. It will be a new environment of disclosure, similar to the laws that we passed for the Clean Campaigns Act in early January of 2020. And SDC is committed to making sure that they engage in, in, in public education and in rulemaking to make sure that they'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are not that they are not creating a chilling effect for organizing work, that this is really about about who's paying for or public influence campaigns that that are at sort of a higher payment payment level. So this this legislation is not intended to, nor does it, I believe, prohibit ongoing efforts of people to continue to organize within'",
        "'speaker_0': 'community, to to do outreach, to either support or oppose legislation that the city council is considering.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Colleagues, any other comments or questions on Amendment two? Hearing no additional comments on Amendment two. Will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of amendment to Grant?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Strauss. Yes. Herbal. Yes. Whereas. Hi, Louis. Yes. For hours, guests must go to. Yes. Yes. Council President Gonzalez?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm in favor and unopposed.'",

My understanding is that they are going to go through a pretty robust community engagement process. I think you mentioned that council president, we discussed it on Wednesday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to reiterate, you know, for ongoing concerns that individuals may have or organizations may have, there's going to be a six month process to fully have conversations with community. I started my line of questioning when the draft bill came over to ask, you know, how how has this been received by various stakeholders and community organizations, our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'grassroots partners? And I look forward to hearing more about how the upcoming, upcoming six months goes. And I know that folks are not shy about continuing to let us know how legislation that we've passed is being implemented and if there are unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that we have shown time and time again a willingness to continue to make improvements. And and I'm really optimistic with the amended language that has been included today that some of those initial concerns that we heard have been addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, President, and your office, for the work that you did with immigrant rights groups, low wage worker organizations, environmental groups. I know you've reached out to a handful of folks, human service provider organizations, to make sure that you are getting some feedback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that work. And it makes me optimistic about this six month conversation to come. And I'm looking forward to report back. Likewise. Kaspersky Lab. Thank you so much for those remarks. Councilmember Salant And then if anyone else wants to speak now and then comes the first one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. As I stated during the amendments, this bill, including the rest of this bill, with the restriction on quote, grassroots lobbying and quote, is not something I can support. I am disappointed that Council President Gonzalez continues to falsely claim that only paid lobbyists are affected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is not true. The definition of quote unquote, grassroots lobbying states quote Any person who has made expenditures not otherwise reported by a registered lobbyist, unquote, and goes on. So it's not not not what the president is saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also want to point out that the council heard from grassroots campaigners in public comment stating that it will have a chilling effect on grassroots organizing. Why would council members pass a law and claim that it will not affect will not show grassroots organizers right after hearing from grassroots organizers that it will have a chilling effect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will be voting no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was memorable. Please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just want to speak to my my belief in my hope. And as Councilman Ross mentioned, we can revisit this issue. But I really believe that the reporting requirements to register are not onerous and they should not result in the kinds of outcomes to true grassroots lobbying that some people might have some concerns about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that the concerns are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Far, far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Outweighed by the harm that this bill seems to seeks to address. And from my perspective, that harm is the allowance of dark money to be used without any disclosure. Many of you remember that last year there was a paid lobbying campaign against the payroll tax legislation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It turns out that the Chamber had noted that they had funded it, but they were not required to disclose this. This, I think, is much more. This lack of disclosure is much more corrosive to our democratic values and our institutions than the burden that this disclosure requirement will place on sort of what we traditionally think of as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'grassroots lobbying. The term grassroots is used in Washington state law, and I don't think it's the clearest term for describing this activity for public understanding. But in practice, it has the same effect of disclosure requirements in in cities like Los Angeles, where they do they define lobbying activities to include seeking to influence the position of a third'",
        "'speaker_2': 'party on municipal legislation or an issue related to municipal legislation by any means, including but not limited to engaging in community, public or press relations activities. I think it's very important that our our regulations be contra content neutral.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But in in being contract content neutral, I don't think the outcome is going to be a neutral outcome. I think the outcome is going to be a much more robust disclosure of of those in positions of power with access to great amounts of resources to our democratic decision making.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's really why I appreciate the proposal of the the Ethics and Elections Commission bringing this forward and the work of Council President Gonzalez in bringing this forward. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those comments. Really, really appreciate that additional texture. Thanks a lot. Colleagues, any other comments on the bill as amended? Okay. Well, colleagues, I'm going to go ahead and close out debate. I want to thank you all for the consideration of this particular bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel really strongly, as indicated by Councilmember Herbold, that the the the benefits of having this kind of lobbying regulation within the city of Seattle far outweighs the burden and the potential hardship of disclosure and and do trust that Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission will work very hard and diligently to make sure that folks understand what the'",

I also don't want to lose over lose sight of the fact that this bill does have two other really important components to it, besides the the grass roots lobbying or indirect lobbying, I think is a much more appropriate term, which is which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is additional disclosure for lobbyists who work on political campaigns, for elected officials or ballot measures, and requiring those disclosures to happen. In addition to that, and making sure that we are including disclosure requirements for lobbying that occurs directly to department directors or their deputy directors or their direct reports.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know that a lot of policy is driven at the department level, at the city of Seattle, and I think that's an important transparency requirement as well.

        "'speaker_0': 'And again, I want to thank Councilmember Stewart as a co-sponsor of this and also for your earlier actions this well this year, starting in February, to bring attention to this issue. And as folks have said, this is the latest iteration of attacks from that government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we all stand in solidarity and want to make sure folks here in our community, especially South Asian community in Seattle and Sikh community, Punjabi community, know that we see, hear and support the protests of farmworkers in India.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. And thanks again for your co-sponsorship. Thank you, Councilmember Muscadet, because we're excellent. I know you have an amendment that you'd like to put before the city council, but before you do that, I wanted to offer you an opportunity to make general comments, if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a co-sponsor of the resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I would like to thank you so much, President Gonzalez. Good afternoon to everybody who is watching this. Members of the public. Our community members. And almost a century ago. Greetings and solidarity to the hundreds of South Asian community members who have been in touch with my office over the last week and whom I've spoken to personally'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the last weeks with a burning sense of urgency to fight the injustice being faced by the farmers and workers in India. Thank you, Councilmember Mosquito, for bringing this forward. I'm honored to co-sponsor this resolution on behalf of my sisters and brothers and siblings in India.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'India's government, headed by Prime Minister Narendra modi and his reactionary Hindu fundamentalist. Part of the agenda, the party or the BJP, have introduced three new laws in September that will dismantle the bare minimum protections or regulations relied on by millions of small farmers for survival.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the new laws, for example, would repeal the minimum support price, which is a publicly mandated price floor, a minimum price at which the government promises to buy produce from small farmers as a measure of basic economic protection for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also agree with Reynoso Cohn, who said during public comment that the ration card system allows the multitude of poor people and working people to access grain, cooking oil and other basic food needs at affordable prices. I personally have childhood memories of getting rice at the local ration shop in Mumbai.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dismantling the Russian system would be a ticket to mass starvation and increased malnutrition. Yesterday morning, my staff and I joined hundreds of sick students and other young people at a protest action near the Space Needle in solidarity with the farmers in India.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As an elected representative of Seattle's working people and as someone who grew up in India and was politicized and radicalized by the understanding of how global capitalism and imperialism have led to continued impoverishment of the Indian masses and the masses in the neocolonial world as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was proud to join the protest rally yesterday as myself and other speakers at the rally said the new laws are going to directly further enrich the already obscenely wealthy billionaires like Mukesh Ambani, who is India's richest man and is like the Jeff Bezos of India and Gautam Adani, both of whom are among the 40 richest people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the world. Farmers and agricultural workers make up 60% of the country's population. A 2018 study found that more than half of the farmers in India were in debt, and this was before the current pandemic and deep capitalist crisis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'More than 20,000 farmers in the country have died by suicide from just from 2018 to 2019. And as the resolution says, over 360,000 since 1995, farmer indebtedness has been a major factor in these suicides. The protests have made world headlines and have led to solidarity actions by South Asian immigrant communities in an especially by the Sikh community'",
        "'speaker_3': 'globally, including right here in the Seattle region as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia. These solidarity protests have even forced establishment politicians to speak publicly in support of the farmers protest, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and a member of the Australian Parliament.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really agree with the community members who testified in public comment today who said that the overwhelming majority are facing a race to the bottom globally and unless we fight back, we are at a loss. I agree with those who said in public comment that they fought with us for the $15 minimum wage and we have direct'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stake in the farmers in India winning their demands. The Indian government has inflicted brutal repression against the farmers and the protesters, with police using batons, water cannons and gas. But as the farmers have said, the police are using tear gas against us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we were already crying at this point. The protests have sustained for nearly three weeks. This is a remarkable. The protest actions of selected multiple transportation and commuting chokepoints with hundreds of thousands of protesters blocking roads and squatting on railway tracks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The farmer protests are also noteworthy in the level of preparation they carried out before launching the actions. For instance, farmers interviewed at the Delhi action say they are prepared enough to be able to sustain the action for months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The protests also have an impressive degree of coordination between the actions in metros such as Delhi and Mumbai and the actions in rural areas in the individual states. They have organized shifts with some attending the protest actions and others tending the land.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Women's committees have helped with providing food or, as are Sikh community members, justified longer every day for the thousands of activists. The protests have not been short of food even for a day. This level of organization and confidence is one of the reasons why the farmers are not intimidated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Despite the brutal tear gas and water cannons used against them by the police, of course, such organizing is not the result of some clever top down management based on ideas of business unionism. Such a level of preparation can only be achieved by first building the political conviction, solidarity and cohesion among hundreds of thousands of oppressed people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The rank and file farmers strengthening the clarity that we have to fight together against the ruling class. That it will be a long and hard fight and will involve significant sacrifice, but that it is worth doing precisely because that is the only way we can successfully push back against the gross injustices faced by the overwhelming majority under'",

It is this type of solidarity that is enabling the protesters to spend night after night in the cold winter in northern India on the back of trucks and tractors. This is the kind of organizing needed for any serious strike action by the labor movement anywhere, because big corporations and the capitalist state have'",

Nearly 350 people have now signed the petition just since last night, and as a number of the speakers in public testimony said, my office alongside the South Asian community organizations, the Sikh students organizations and labor unions'",
        "'speaker_3': ', is organizing a car caravan rally on January eight in solidarity with the general strike in India, which is going to be extremely important because it is this kind of solidarity among workers and farmers that can really put the Modi Modi regime on the defensive, on the back foot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we need escalating tactics like this in order to ensure that we don't get complacent and that we win our victories. I'm also proud of the track record of my Socialist Council office in helping to build international working class solidarity, which is crucial for the global fight back against capitalism.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As was mentioned before, just in January and February this year. I know it feels like an age ago. I also kept thinking it was last year, but it just this year my office brought forward the resolution against Modi's anti-Muslim and for citizenship laws, which South Asian activists and socialists fought for together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we saw the Modi pro Modi supporters, the Bucks, the the Sun guys who came here and spoke in such divisive, deeply rightwing language. Last year, we brought forward a proclamation condemning the repression by the Modi regime in Kashmir in August 2014.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My office sent a public letter in solidarity with the oppressed people of Palestine, calling on Obama, then President Obama and the members of both Houses of Congress to condemn the bombardment and violence by the Israeli regime in Gaza.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When the City Council passed a resolution from my office in February opposing Modi and the BJP's citizenship laws, we made Seattle the first city to take a position. Since then, five additional cities have done the same, with San Francisco being the sixth city to pass a resolution in July.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And my general comments by echoing the slogan and adding another slogan of the movement. The movement has settled on 8000, which means farmers stay united or long live farmer unity. I think as we head into the January 8th action, which is absolutely crucial for hundreds of millions of workers who will be on strike alongside the farmers, along'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with the student movement, we have to also raise the slogan Kissan Mazdoor Zindabad, which is Long live the unity between farmers and workers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Salant Okay. We're going to go ahead and consider Amendment one now that we've heard general comments. So before we open it up for any additional comments on the underlying resolution, there is an amendment that was circulated previously today consistent with council rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to go ahead and recognize council members want for that motion of Amendment One.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I move Amendment one inserting the following sentences. Section three The Seattle City Council stand in solidarity with the farmers organizations, trade union federations and student unions in India. Organizing for a General Strike on January eight, 2021 to unite the movement of oppressed peoples, demanding the restoration of protections for small farmers, increasing the minimum wage, ending'",
        "'speaker_3': 'privatizations, and defending the rights of religious and ethnic minorities. We heard from a number of ordinary people today in public comments, specifically from the Sikh community and also the broader Asian community. And every single person of those spoke in favor of this amendment was the proposed amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The protest movement has already shown enormous strength, as I mentioned before, having lasted nearly three weeks with an impressive degree of organization and political strength. However, it would be fatal if we got complacent. The movement has to escalate in order to force the Modi regime to concede to the movement's demands.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Modi regime will keep trying various divide and conquer tricks to try and break the back of the movement, for example, labeling Sikh farmers as terrorists. They will keep trying these tactics if they don't succeed in their in that horrendous effort.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then the regime, the super wealthy and big business will simply try and wait out the movement, wait for protesters to get exhausted and demoralized. As members of the labor movement like myself know, we we have seen this happen and we know that when we are fighting the bosses, we need to have tactics that will escalate the struggle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and put increased pressure on the bosses to force them to concede to workers and unions demands. So it is absolutely crucial that the trade union movement in India has announced the general strike for January eight. The call for the general strike, as I said, is being supported by 100 farmer organizations, ten trade union confederations that represent hundreds'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of millions of workers, union members and student organizations. The unions are demanding the restoration of protections for small farmers, increasing the minimum wage, establishing pensions and Social Security for workers, ending privatizations and defending the rights of religious and ethnic minority.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To understand the potential impact of such an action and why, I am urging Council members to support this amendment. We should know that the Indian trade movement has carried out three general strike actions recently one in January 2019, one in January of this year, and a third one just weeks ago in late November.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Each of those general strikes has been the single largest general strike in global labor history. The one in 2019 was the largest in global labor history, and the one in January this year was the largest. And then now the one that happened in November was the largest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The last two general strikes, including the one in November, brought 250 million work union members out, not 250,000 people. And so these are these are absolutely massive. These are earth shattering actions. And I think this is exactly the kind of earth shattering action that we need in order to be able to combat the hundreds of billions and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'indeed trillions of dollars that are facing the poor farmers and workers at the hands of the billionaire class. I really urge council members to support this amendment. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council member Solent Councilor Silent has made a motion to put Amendment One before us. Is there a second debate? Okay. It's been moved and seconded to amend the resolution as presented on Amendment one. Council members want you when you have already made comments about Amendment One.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to go ahead and open it up to the floor to see if there are any additional comments on Amendment one. And as usually is, the case councilors want, you will.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Final.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Word.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On Amendment One. But for now, we're going to go ahead and open up for any additional comments on amendment. Councilmember Strauss, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President. Thank you. Councilmembers and the state in support for bringing this resolution forward. I will be supporting the base resolution since public comment. Councilmember stop underscore from Kent who brought this resolution to our city council for consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Called me to ask what other public commenters were speaking about when discussing Section three, as she had not previously been aware of Section three. She from my communications and my phone call with her just in the last number of hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is her preference to retain the focus of this resolution on sections one and two. And for those reasons, I will not be voting for this amendment, although I support this resolution and everything that is brought forward. Thank you, Councilmembers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Strauss. Any additional comments on Amendment one? Hey, hearing no additional comments on Amendment one? Councilmember Swann. Any closing remarks that you'd like to make before we take up the vote on this amendment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I appreciate Councilmember Strauss. I don't I completely disagree with Councilmember Strauss for not supporting this amendment and also the reasons he stated. I think they're quite stunning. But I do appreciate that Councilmember Strauss was open about why he was going to vote no on the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's a rare instance of where it is. It can become clear to members of the public why certain things are happening in the halls of government. But unfortunately, nobody else has spoken to, which I'm not sure what to make of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do appreciate councilmember horrible seconding of my amendment so that we can at least have a discussion. But I think that it is extremely important to recognize that regardless of what ethnicity elected officials may have at the end of the day, that the test that we have, we as an ordinary people have to put them to is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are they standing with the ordinary people of whatever issue is at hand or are they standing with the establishment? And I think it's very telling that, at least according to what Councilman Bustos has said, and I'm and I'm, you know, assuming that other council members or whoever other council members share that position, I would say that it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is deeply unfortunate because it is not a question of one elected official, even if they may be from a certain community. Dozens of people from the same ethnic community testified in public comment, saying that they wanted you to support that action and they had their own version.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Describe why they think it's important, because they understand that this action is has the potential to greatly escalate the struggle which the farmers and the workers understand the need to do. They understand that they need to build unity, which is why there was a general strike in November by the workers in solidarity with the farmers, because they'",
        "'speaker_3': 'understand that actually they not only strengthen the farmers movement, they strengthen their own movement, and that the struggles of oppressed peoples are interlinked. And so I just want all the ordinary people, community members sake and social South Asian community members to understand what is going on here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the end of the day, we have to observe if politicians are doing the bidding of other establishment politicians or are they actually listening to community members who one after one after one came and said that they want the city council to support this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will, of course, be voting yes on this amendment, and I still urge council members to vote yes on it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to close out debate on this particular amendment. So let's go ahead and have the clerk call the roll on the adoption of Amendment One. One.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Strauss. Oh. Book?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whereas now. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Yes. Rosetta.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Peterson. It's just nice to see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Peterson had to leave.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Unfortunately for Council President Gonzalez, no votes were in favor and four opposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The the motion fails for a lack of majority one way or the other. So the amendment is not adopted. We're not going to move to consideration of the resolution, and I think we've had a lot of debate on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were there any additional comments on the resolution as proposed? Which data, please? Thank you very much, Madam President. So I want to be really clear as well that the folks that I'm hearing from, including members not only that have been elected, but members who are working directly with the Punjabi community and the community at large who've been'",
        "'speaker_0': 'asking for this. I think that folks want to send a clear message about what is currently happening in India. A message to the congressional delegation. And for me personally, that does not mean not wanting to support a general strike.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that there is going to be another meeting and more opportunities for us to continue to show solidarity with the general strike. But I want to make sure that I'm following the lead of the Punjabi community who's been reaching out and asking for the specific language in the resolution today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will be making sure that we're pushing out information about the general strike. I know that folks don't come to a strike easily. This is often the last line that gets brought. Sorry, the last line of effort to try to make sure that messages are being heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know time and time again that these farmers have tried. They have tried to negotiate. They have protested. They have put their lives in harm's way, both because of COVID and because of the ongoing repressive attacks from the police and the governments being exposed to very cold temperatures and water cannons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their life is on the line. And so we know that they have done everything they can. Personally, I support the general strike. I'll be putting out messages from our office in support to make sure that folks know how to participate in the caravan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Council member silent. But in following what what the Punjabi community has asked for today, which is a very clear resolution specific to a international I'm sorry, a national message across the globe. I am very excited about this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's an unfortunate sort of conversation about who we're following, but I don't think that those two things have to stand in isolation. We can send forward this clear resolution today and also stand in support of the upcoming general strike, which I plan to do, and I plan to send out messages from our office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure folks here directly that this is absolutely something that I am interested in doing in support of those who have reached out initially. Very happy to have this resolution passed today. And that says and that said, I'm also going to be supporting the call for the general strike.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that that is not a decision people come to lightly, often the last line of defense when thinking about the strategies in front of us. And it takes a huge act of courage to do so. So personally, I want to focus now where we were at, but wanted to stand in solidarity and follow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The lead of the Punjabi community has been reaching out to our office and more information forthcoming obviously on that first week of action in January. I think it comes from a mosquito. It was more silent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I don't agree as a member of the labor movement myself that it's not easy for workers to go on strike. It is a very difficult decision because it requires a tremendous amount of sacrifice. There's a lot of uncertainty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are lots of twists and turns because bosses or in this case, the more the regime and the billionaire class were not given easily, in fact, they will, in fact, try to wait out the movement as much as they can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so during the strike action is requires a lot of resilience, a lot of strategic and tactical political clarity for the workers and continued solidarity for them to not be able to vote for the strike, to not be broken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm not sure what is being achieved by this council not supporting this by not supporting the amendment for the strike action, because they have already declared the strike action. So when we agree that it's not easy for them to do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that means that it has been it has been an extremely hard and long and hard road for them. So they have already declared the strike action. I'm not sure how it helps to fight for the general strike by sending a message of, well, this is not what the Punjabi community wants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also don't agree, unfortunately, with the idea that that not having the clause for the the general strike support is somehow following the lead of the Punjabi community. It's not some homogeneous community. We heard from dozens of Punjabi and Sikh working people today and dozens more and hundreds more have, you know, have spoken in different ways, not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just today, that they are supporting this strike action that they wanted the city council to also supported. Absolutely agree that we all should be supporting the January 8th Act. And I appreciate you expressing support for the action that we are organizing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I wanted to call on everybody, all the ordinary people, members of the public who are watching this. Let's make sure we organize a massive, massive, historic January 8th, 2021, car caravan rally in Seattle at 3 p.m.. I'm not saying the location yet because we are going to decide the location and let everybody know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my point is that it is a let's make it a massive and successful action and let's stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the masses in India who are struggling for a better world. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But that we're going to go ahead and close out debate here since the sponsors have spoken last on this particular resolution. So will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the resolution?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stress? Yes. Verbal? Yes. Whereas. Yes. RUIZ Yes. Morales Yes.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Council President Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The resolution is adopted and the chair will sign it. Will the police effects my signature to the legislation on my behalf? Other business? Is there any other business to come before the council? Council Member Mosquito. Thank you very much, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to thank all of you as well. Council Member House President means that. Thanks to everyone this morning to you for stewarding us through a really tough and challenging 2020. And I appreciate the stewardship that you provided.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also want to thank my office and Aretha, who has been working on this resolution that just passed today and her presence at the rally at the Seattle center as well yesterday. And all of the work that our team has been doing between Aretha Friday and a lawyer interim, we got some 20,000 emails just specific to the budget'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the last few weeks. And really they're going to continue to come from her office as we endeavor to get responses back out to everybody and look forward to working with all of you on various issues coming up in 2021.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to say thanks for all of your hard work this year on the budget. I know that we took a lot of your time and your family's time and your community time to work with the community, with our budget process here and and through the committee deliberations that were very lengthy at times.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much. Thanks to Essential Staff, our entire team and I look forward to working on more with Andrew on housing coming up and seasonal workers rights and what do you think on health issues and on everything related to community safety?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Lori, who's just been tremendous in our office on how we're responding to constituent inquiries, I just want to say thanks as per usual councilmember, whereas I couldn't get away with not doing it. Madam President, I'd like to also request to be excused on January one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There we go. There's the city council business. All right. There's been a motion for members data to be excused on January 4th. Is there any objection to that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I object. This better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not cause I don't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have a lot of paper before I object.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to take that objection in in the ingest and assume that there is no actual objection number. Ms.. Gay that will be excused for January 4th, 2020. Is there any other business to come before the Council?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Colleagues, this does conclude the items of business on today's agenda. This is our last regularly scheduled Marathon City Council meeting for the year of 2020. Our next regularly scheduled City Council Council meeting is on Monday, January 4th, 2021 at 2:00 PM.'",
