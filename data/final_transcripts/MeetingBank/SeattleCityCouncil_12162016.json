        "'speaker_9': 'And so so I'm fine with holding it. I'm just I'm just not optimistic that holding it will yield a different answer in terms of whether or not the property will actually be suitable for affordable housing if that evaluation continues to be done under the same analytical, analytical framework that exists right now.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think I would support moving this, holding this till we're about to go into recess for a couple of weeks, as I think a lot of folks around here, we could do January 9th or the well, I think the third we won't have we wouldn't have a lot of time to do anything between.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be sure to describe what our options are before we make a formal motion. We can refer we can hold it for a date certain, of course, and pick that date and agree on that. Or we can simply refer back to the committee, at which point the committee could figure out the timeline, which I think would be a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'recommended preferred action in this situation. That may give Councilmember Gonzales some opportunity to talk about the more global issue on how we dispose of property without having to change that a few times. Katherine Burgess does want to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question for Councilmember O'Brien, and I don't know if you know the answer, but it's my understanding that the executive represented to us that this these two parcels were were timely in front of us to be disposed of and had budget implications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you know about that or. And I'm sorry, I just haven't. Yeah, no, that's fair. In the background, we did ask the question, there was a strong sense of urgency we received on moving this forward, but I did not hear a specific I believe the funding that would generate from this is intended to go towards paying back'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a loan. I don't know if it's an interphone loan or other type of loan on work in South Lake Union. I believe on Mercer my sense was, but I can't speak specifically was that without this there are other mechanisms, it's just kind of a hassle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I think I think if I may.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also believe if I'm not wrong, Councilmember Brown, that both of these were purchased using gas tax funds. And therefore, it's a requirement that the money go back into a road usage expenditure that we can't use these resources for things like homelessness or affordable housing or other issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've got to put it back into the roadway account.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that is accurate. I mean, no insight about the revenue side of this, but it is it is heavily restricted to what's the 19th Amendment to the Constitution in 1818. Thank you, Councilmember. So if it's not, if, if we don't know of a specific time sensitive reason that we have to act today, then I would favor sending'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it back to committee, which then gives the committee flexibility as to when to bring it forward or how to address these other issues yet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And again, you know, I think I acknowledge the 18th Amendment issues. We may end up with the same answer I am flagging, not necessarily a policy question specific to these exact pieces of property in these parcels. I am flagging a broader policy question and I know that the mayor has already announced an intent to look at.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And our policies around how we surplus property based on the city's value and priority of affordable housing. I just I'm a little nervous that we're advancing this these this this question today without giving ourselves the opportunity, without giving the executive the opportunity to really take a look at what those changes should be and how those changes could'",
        "'speaker_9': 'impact either these parcels or much more importantly, future parcels down down the road. And and because I don't I didn't see a sense of urgency around acting now. I would I would strongly favor holding these and giving ourselves the time and the executive the time that they need in order to be able to take a take a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'harder look at those policies in and equip us with the ability to make more strategic decisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I can just quickly follow up, you said to hold them. My recommendation is to refer it back to committee so we can spend some time there. Are you okay with that? I'm sorry to refer to refer back to the committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm fine with the referral.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's a closed debate. I will move to refer. I'll take them separately. 32 and 33. I'll move to refer agenda item number 32 Council Constable 118790. Back to the Sustainability and Transportation Committee. All those in favor of that motion say I, I, those opposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, no, the ayes have it. I'll also make a motion to refer agenda item number 33. Constable 118791 back to the Transportation and Sustainability and Transportation Committee. Any comments? All those in favor of the motion. Vote I, I oppose vote no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so we'll send those back to committee and we'll also do some work around Councilmember Gonzalez's larger issue. And thank you for flagging that and bringing that up, Councilmember Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to thank the bank councilmember, Brian, for being receptive to to to my concerns. I really I really do appreciate your willingness to work through it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And if I could just say a couple more things. I know I'm the one standing between us and recess at the moment here, but the I believe there there was some urgency for it, but I don't think it was like this has to absolutely happen today.'"

And so we're going to operate on the assumption that it's not ultimately critical. And so I think this is fine, but we can send the signal that in the future, if these are really timely, please be explicit on that'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So we know the issues, the broad issue around housing, too. I in the interim, I would hope that Councilman Gonzalez, you and I can connect with the Office of Housing to talk about that, because if, in fact, the framework for looking at affordable housing needs to adjust a bit, then I think we'd want to consider putting these'",
