        "'speaker_0': 'Well, okay, any other questions? So what we'll try to do? Well, I'm going to suggest a motion to reconsider by the end of the meeting. If we are not finished and I'll look at what our options are, whether we'll consider it another day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know if it's so time sensitive. We can't do it in January. I just don't know. And the acceptance of months, perhaps it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just say that the Budget Office has suggested that we need this money to spend before the end of the year from grants. And I would recommend that we move forward. And to the extent that we can just withdraw that $90,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Grant, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wasn't suggesting we don't do that. I would just suggesting that if we don't have it finished by the end of this agenda, we just can't sit here and look at each other for 20 minutes. And so I was going to say, let's revisit it then.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'attached to the Council bill, which again, I don't oppose those other grant acceptances. I just have issue with this one.'",

And so today, I think the question is not necessarily so much of the amount of time that is available to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city, to the council to approve the acceptance of the grants eventually. But the appropriations that are in the fourth quarter supplemental that are backed by those grants are contingent upon the acceptance of the grants. And so what would be the issue potentially is not having those appropriations for the 2018 budget in 2018.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the other items.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't understand what you just said.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Actually, I do. And so if I can try this one more time that we have a supplemental budget and the reason why Councilmember Suarez and again, thank you Councilmember Juarez for voting with us on that was that we had to be able to pass that out today to be able to make payments before the end of 2018'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And the grants will assist us in making those payments, some as general fund and some where we're backed by these grants. So if we can today take out exclude 1.37, which is the reimbursement for the police department and be able to remove that and then vote for all of the other grants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That would be much appreciated by our CBO and the mayor's office in particular, who have signed these bills.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well-spoken.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, at the risk of. The the night. How much money is that?'",
        "'speaker_4': '$99,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. The exact amounts of the $90,000. It may very well not be approved by our action today. Are we keeping alive the possibility to still get it through our actions if we reconsider it? Because while I respect Council Member Gonzalez's principal position on this, I may not share it if it's reimbursement for moneys that we of work'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we've already done. So I want to make sure that at least we could preserve I could preserve my argument to get that reimbursement, because that 9000 is going to have to come from somewhere. And I may just cut in some other central services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the the appropriations the grant backed appropriations in the supplemental are contingent upon the acceptance of the grants. And so so that's the first issue. But the approval of removing some of the grants and being silent on another grant would not, in and of itself constitute a rejection of that one grant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I don't know enough about the background of the particular $90,000 grant to know what time by when it must be its acceptance must be approved. There may be more time to accept that. But what? But the approving the receipt of the other grant moneys would not affect that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me just just one minute. The there was one suggestion that got lost in the shuffle about ad and councilmember war on here. And I'm just going to see from a practical standpoint whether she's still following the information or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember words, are you still on the line? She is not. So I think I lost that possibility as well. Okay. Just wanted someone to make that suggestion. So. So. Okay, so let's do this. Um, I'm going to make a motion that we reconsider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Bill 119425 as amended, reconsidered at the end of today's agenda during the adoption of other legislation section second. Okay. Any discussion on that? All those in favor say I. I opposed. The ayes have it. So we will reconsider the end of today's agenda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'President Herrell Yes, we are reconsidering it at the end of today's agenda for the purposes of amending it or proposing an amendment to remove the 95,000 or having a vote with an additional council member on the existing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good question. Both. That's why I stated what I was going to do during the other members was also see whether council member, whereas could be available and also see whether we can just take that out. Because what if they come back and say you just can't take it out?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know. So I made it vague to reconsider, to pursue all options. We're just reconsidering it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've got something here. What do you got?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let's. Can we just go two years worth of action here. So let's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go. The president. Yes. I appreciate that clarity, and I appreciate the question. Sorry. So the grant acceptance ordinance does not require a supermajority, unlike the supplemental. That was all I want to point out. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it requires a majority. And she would have been very shy. So I didn't suggest we need we had 42 so it'd be five two if she'd voted in favor. It could be for three for all I know.'",
