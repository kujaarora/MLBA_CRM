So we're back before you this evening for approval of that agreement, which involves Catullus has an obligation to build a service road that would connect from phase three of their project, which is north of Mitchell Avenue to the parking lot at Estuary Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, that obligation to build that service road is not triggered until they have actually constructed the residential project and the city staff thought it might be a good idea to accelerate that construction project. And because we were reimbursed last year for some expenses that could tell us, oh, the city for some cost involved, that the demolition of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the hospital building and the construction of a star while the funds were available to accelerate the project. That's why the council appropriated the funds in the midyear. And now what we're asking for is approval of the contract such that we can have Catullus construct the road, the city will front the funds, and then when Catullus reimbursed, builds'",

Earlier today, in approving this record, also approving a roadway design for what is ostensibly being called a temporary roadway, but is likely a roadway that will be connecting'",
        "'speaker_5': 'one of our new and very important parks for 5 to 10 years at a minimum, and that the way that the market's going could be even longer. I was surprised to see in the packet that the connections to this park for biking and walking were actually below our standard recommendations for how we do that and that we're'",

It's not expected to be really high volume and I would really appreciate support for a motion that would approve the agreement, but also give direction that perhaps we make sure that our priority mode standards be met as we're designing this street that will be connecting many of our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'new residents to this park, as well as kids who are going to practices and games.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Miss Potter, from a staff perspective, do you have any thing that we should take into consideration?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would like to defer to Scott Wickstrom, the city engineer who worked with us to develop the cross section. That is an exhibit to the reimbursement agreement. And Scott is here this evening, and he is prepared to talk about why this is the cross-section that staff is recommending.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please, Mr. Ricks, please. Address this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. My name is Collection. I'm the city engineer. It's a question that Vice Mayor Knox White posed a couple of days ago about how the street section came to be and what are some of the rationale for it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's the first thing to start out with this. This is a driveway or a temporary access road to the backside of Astoria Park in their future, expanded parking lot. One thing to keep in mind when you start thinking about driveways as driveways, you typically think of as a relatively short distance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This driveway is over 800 feet long. It's longer than three city blocks. It is effectively a road. I mean, there's no other way to look at it that it's really a roadway connection from the individual to the parking lot for Estuary Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we start looking at roads and looking at typical roadway design, the first thing to start looking at is what is the typical curb to curb with? And I know there's a lot of talk and discussion in the masterplan about narrower lane ways to reduce speeds to kind of keep the speeds at a 25 mile an'",
        "'speaker_3': 'hour limit. But the one that considerations that always comes in from an engineering perspective is what is a lane with by definition as it comes to a legal definition that is defendable in case something should ever happen. And we we as the city, would find ourselves in court.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if it does have some guidelines in terms of curb and gutters are not included in the lane list, nor are. And you also do apply for some shy distance away from vertical curves. So the goal was to keep basically to ten foot lanes and allow enough room for the curb and gutter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So effectively you have a a 22 foot face curve to face curve. And unfortunately, I think at the exhibit in the packet shows 23 foot. That is incorrect. It's actually a 22 foot base of curve when it comes to the pathway and the rationale for the pathway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was again, the general plan talks about guidance and stuff like that, but I was looking for actual hard value numbers that came across our city of Alameda, pedestrian design guidelines that date back to 2011. They do specifically talk about multi-use path trails and their adjacency to roadways and recommend, at a minimum, Caltrans standards of a ten'",
        "'speaker_3': 'foot wide road. And that was the basis for the design that was provided. Again, this is a temporary road. One does can see that it by its length. It is more than just a typical driveway. And should the roadway ever connect all the way to Main Street, which is envisioned in the general plan, there would certainly be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'an opportunity to look at the enhancing the pedestrian and bicycle connections at that time to something more suitable for a long term pathway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to ask you, Mr. Wikstrm, what's what's your timeframe on moving forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Catalysis prepared to move forward shortly after this authorization?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if the decision were put off for a couple of weeks, would there be any detriment to this agreement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not significant. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to. I defer to my colleague, the vice mayor. Do you. Do you have a, um. A motion, a modified motion you're prepared to make?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, the motion I would make is that we we approve the agreement, so it doesn't need to come back, but give but but ask that a design that provides that preferred 12 foot mixed use pathway and to ten foot or a 20 foot fire code rated for a driveway or any street be met there is the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and that the cost should be enough that the cost differential should, if anything, be positive for the city. It should become less expensive because a lot of these pathways are built at a much cheaper level and that if for some reason it is found that that can't be built, that they can bring back, that they can bring'",
        "'speaker_5': 'back that issue on consent, we can approve it. So I mean, this is from my standpoint, this is a this is a driveway. It doesn't need to be built, is why it is the Golden Gate Bridge. It's something we want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People driving low in nine foot lanes are perfectly acceptable. So it may be that FHA has guidelines, but now it also has guidelines for these types of streets. Caltrans says perfectly acceptable for us to follow narrow and for a driveway to a park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we should be really putting our money where our mouth is and building the streets that give us the access to parks that we we want, which is on using active transportation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll just note for the record that I feel somewhat at a disadvantage because I have not seen the diagram, that it's not an attachment to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's it's a page seven and eight of the attachment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They just have. Haven't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are they?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So could this interim city attorney chime in here? Is it? Are we providing sufficient direction to city staff? Is there a way to do this with some clarity so we all get what we're looking for?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I think the motion that Vice Mayor Knox White has made will improve the reimbursement agreement and give direction to staff in terms of what he would like the. The project in question to look like. And if there's council support for that, I think that's ample to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the part of the motion was that it could not be built that way to bring back that aspect for the Council to consider further.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The interim city manager wanted to comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the the road with there it looks like it well it calls at 23 but you say it's 22, correct. And would it be used as a fire lane? It fire access road would need to be 22 feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, a fire access road is is by code is 20 feet. It comes down to the definition of what a what a lane is relative to the vertical curve. So there's a little bit of nuance and a lot of it comes down to what would happen should should an accident occur and should the city be held liable'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And then that's when things start looking at, you know, when at what point, what our actual lane was, what are the defined definitions of it? It gets to be subtlety. It's a nuance and it gets to be at some point, it's a legal issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anything we do in a public ride away has to be based on some recognizable, undefined standard Pashto. FHB way NAC do is a guidance, but it's not the same as FHB Wiranto. So the recommendation for the 2020 flight was not looking at this as a driveway per se because it is 800 and 880 feet long looking at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it really is it as a functioning roadway? It's more than three city blocks long that it's it's a bit of a misnomer to refer to it as a driveway. Granted, the the amount of vehicles on it are going to be relatively not to tremendously high use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But however, just the pure length of it take to consider a driveway is a bit of a bit of a misnomer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So further clarification. Clarification question, how would the city council know what a modified design, if any, that is, is is achieved?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I may suggest it's probably best if maybe perhaps Vice Mayor Knox White and I meet separately off line and discuss this through, and then we could come back again in a couple of weeks and content with hopefully something that is agreeable to both parties and to the council as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I mean, this is a decision for for the whole council to be made aware of, although. Okay. Any any other thoughts from my colleagues here, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. So help me through the chair. So the drawing here on page eight shows ten foot of pedestrian bike path and then 23 foot of roadway. I mean, what's the proposed? What do we want them to come back with?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it's asking the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so what I would propose to Mr. Wikstrm is comment that the number is actually 22. So the idea would be to reduce that to 20 feet to ten foot lanes or to nine foot lanes and a one foot gutter, both of which would be defensible and a 12 foot multi-use path.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which would then meet our preferred standards for multi-use paths.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So then my question would be to our city attorney. I mean, this is an attachment to the contract, right? So we'd have to make sure. They went we went back to and they agreed to it. And we didn't give notice to the public that we were doing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know this. So I'm a little sure. Just want to make sure we don't run afoul of any Sunshine Ordinance things and that we're, you know, we're not. I'm perfectly supportive of the change, by the way, but I just want to make sure we do it the right way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's another party to the contract, obviously.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It it certainly seems to me that the the exhibit, which is part of the agreement that was that's been available to the public, indicated a certain design, a certain with the modification being suggested here does not seem much different than what is proposed here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, it's a three foot difference in round numbers. So I think it is within the ambit of what has been described in the agenda report as well as in the agenda title. So I think if the council took action tonight, that was certainly to be appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the council has some concerns about having the more a a revised design as part of the reimbursement agreement that the city engineer and and the vice mayor can discuss and see if there might be some some redesign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can certainly bring back the reimbursement agreement in two weeks or a month and have it considered. I don't think there's a time a time crunch here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I appreciate that, Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think at least what I would appreciate is if there is some sort of alternative plan that could be put forward that we as a council get to weigh in on what we're actually approving and that it gets agenda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it sounds like there isn't a rush to get this approved tonight. I my preference would be in an abundance of caution and transparency. Wait here. This.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So what I would propose, if everyone is agreeable to this is actually just what our city engineer proposed. Could you and the vice mayor arrange to meet offline? This is a former planning board president and go over, you know, have a chance to sit down face to face and with drawings in front of you and and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'then bring this back to us when you're ready as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I would probably guess I'd probably be a month. Considering the turnaround timeframes on counterpart, so they would likely be back in a month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That sounds fine. Do we need a comment, please? Council member Desai.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I just want to say that we have our engineer here giving us some insights, recommendations on professional expertize when it comes to building a temporary road that's almost 800 feet. So this is, for all intents and purposes, a road.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think what caught my attention was his reference to safety and how that relates to legal issues. For me, that was a it's an important point because, you know, at a at a park like estuary park where activity will occur, there is a possibility of people getting injured.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for example, from myself during the Alameda City tournament, I experienced incredibly grave cramps such that we actually called the the fire department. And I was transported by the ambulance to Kaiser. And to me, I believe a fire ambulance back into I think on a close to the where I was laying on the ground prone because of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'incredible cramps. So I think this is not an issue that that we should take lightly the safety related issues and how we could, you know, how we would serve our residents in the event of of some emergency. And also the related legal questions at this point, I'm satisfied, frankly, with the with the recommendation from our staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll leave it at that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. I'll make a motion to continue. This item to, I guess, the first meeting in February.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I was actually asking procedurally, is that the best way to do that? Okay. Okay. So we have, uh, I might leave. It's your motion, but you might want to leave the date open. I'm happy to just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Continue this and whatever date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Soon as possible that it can become a back end with. With the understanding that you will meet with the city engineer. Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I make a suggestion that you also add to it to incorporate the comments. From the dais. Thank you. I'll second that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all the comments, including all of our colleagues. All right. Okay. So we have a motion in a second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I make one comment or comment after it's done? I just wanted to. I have actually met with Mr. Wickstrom. I appreciate his diligence and care and know that you know that to Tony's there. Council member disagrees comments very does take safety and whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I also know that he understands very much that there are lots of ways to look at safety and design and whatever else. I just want to thank you for this. I'm sorry that we didn't have a time with my travel schedule to connect on this before the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the future, I will try to avoid that. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm sure on behalf of the council, I just want to thank all three of our speakers for the work that your your agencies and groups do. Thank you very much. Okay. So any council discussion or do we have a motion?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I ask a quick question before.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, Vice Mayor And that's wait.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm not sure who this question is for. I will preface it by saying I found trying to figure out what the exact need statement was a little. It might have been that I was jetlagged and a little addled, but a little difficult to find.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I wanted to suggest that when we actually approve it, that we we pull out the need statement. But the staff report mentions and one of the speakers mentioned that food security was a key item. And yet in the actual need statement, food security is not mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I wanted to see if that was intentional or if it was an unintentional unintentionally just not mentioned explicitly. The fact that it's in the staff report made me think that maybe it just wasn't written into the made statement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Too to be a staff member. You will to address that question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for your comments. We will make a more concerted effort next year to specifically identify the needs and more clearly. And regarding your question regarding food security. I think that was unintentional. I know it does cross the groups.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Few food security affects all of the populations that are described in the Schwab newsletter. But I think it would be helpful to explicitly state that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I know that we've been a long time provider of CBT, CB DB G grants to the food bank, and I would just want to make sure that when we send a needs statement out that they are aware that they can apply again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they were our highest scoring nonprofit last year, so we would want them to look like we are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unfortunately, we have a lot of great applicants. My other quick question, I guess this is just a question for consideration for my my council colleagues. We have the council last year funded tenant legal services and tenant legal services are also specifically called out on the CDBG needs assessment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I wonder if we wanted to perhaps talk about that. There are some other. Now either, you know, whether we want also to be funding additional tenant legal services here or if we want to look at other. But with as anything, whether we should remove that, clarify what we mean so that we're not actually having two pots'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of money funding two different legal services efforts. So I don't I don't have a specific recommended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Point of I think we've probably exhausted our need for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Under the CDBG program, the only tenant legal services we fund are through the senior legal services. So those services are strictly for the seniors. And that was a service that that was a service that senior legal services recently expanded to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When they the first year they were funded, they did not provide legal services for housing related issues. And they because the need is so great and we hadn't yet the Council hadn't yet done its legal services funding contract that just went in place in November.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They expanded and it's a conversation that we can have as part of the NOVA process to see if there if there's a need or a specific kind of niche for seniors that we would want to continue to have them provide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or they could go back to the kind of legal services they've been providing, which tend to be about benefits and other kinds of services for for seniors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think just where we're at in terms of the cycle of funding, I would hate to see that change be something that we're discussing now. I do think that with the new legal services contract that we have and through the city, I think it'll be interesting to see what happens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As somebody who used to work in legal services, I found that a lot of times when clients come to you, they come to you with a number of different issues specific to certain groups, whether it's youth or seniors in particular.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Typically, when they come, they come with a number of different issues. And so those specialized legal services really are helpful. And while we might have a vendor that does overall tenant protections, that might not be something we wouldn't want to necessarily have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The senior then transferred to another attorney, start a case file all over again, kind of relive whatever trauma they've been through yet again. So I, I hear the comment about, you know, is there is there a possibility of maybe consolidating these two things?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'd be interested to see just how many of our seniors are using the legal services specific to seniors, what they're using it for, and then make a decision later on about if we want to open it up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then relative to the need statement, the need statement is, is from the way we talk about the need statement from the president of the Social Services Human Relations Board. That's exhibit one. So we would be just amending that to include the food services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question regarding the the legal services for seniors. What is the venue of that if a senior wants to seek legal services? Mr. ASHBROOK, Perhaps you can if.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to have someone here who's the expert on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just I want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Something, and if you could, I just speaking to the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first off, I just want to say I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there are other legal service agencies being funded through this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe legal assistance for seniors is the only agency that is providing legal assistance specifically for the needs of seniors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'From what I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Know, I'm the development director, so I'm raising funds for the organization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But from what I know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They started developing this program, obviously, for the benefit of the seniors to prevent evictions. Now, if landlord assistance or landlord representation is also needed, then we are designing those services to also address that as well. So it could be that the legal representation to protect the senior could be legal, represent representation on behalf of the landlord or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the tenant. But we're not doing two separate. It's one legal housing program that can address the needs of both the tenant or the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so that's one issue. But you also talked earlier about seniors might contact you about health benefits, about elder abuse, financial issues. And my question is simply location. Where does a senior go to avail themselves of your services?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Mastic Senior Center. We have attorneys that hold regular hours there on a regular basis. And we also run a health insurance counseling and advocacy program where we do Medicare counseling also. So in addition to Mastic Senior Center, we also do those out of our office on at three, three, three, Helgenberger.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you. That's very helpful. When you sit down, that was that was helpful. One of the concerns that I have expressed to staff and we're going to continue to look at this is the and we do have a contract for legal services through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Since they are allowed in but it's in Oakland in the Fruitvale District. And so it means that our tenants need to get themselves over to Fruitvale. So I think especially for seniors who may be limited in their their mobility, I think it's great to know that your services are provided at Mastic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I almost forgot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also provide them in the home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe we we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go out and do home visits and take care of any need in the home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Yes. Councilmember Garza, did you have a question for Mr. Ashbrook?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, I just want to comment comically. I do. As a council member, I do think it's imperative that we as a city have a special set aside with regard to tenant protections for our elderly, largely because when it comes to the elderly, how they respond to crises is very different from the working age population, for example.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oftentimes, they can't fall back on a job to deal with issues. Sometimes they're also frail. So I think it is imperative that that we acknowledge that that unique situation that elderly residents face. To be sure, many residents are potentially vulnerable when it comes to housing issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in unique ways, the elderly are especially vulnerable. So for that reason, I think it is important to have a set aside with regard to them via the CDBG program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brody, did you have a comment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I'll be quick. Just echo a lot of what my colleagues just said. I mean, we're just adapting the needs statement today so we're not deciding any funding or making any direction on funding. So I'm comfortable with the needs statement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And these are the problems that are the most pressing in our community. And, you know, we never seem to have enough for that release. But I just wanted to just point out, you know, the second priority there. The first one is affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the second one is is preventing homelessness and other housing crisis is increasing housing opportunities for homeless and extremely low income households, deliver support services to promote stability and independence and measure these successes. So we should keep those in mind as we make other decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I would just like to echo all my colleagues, really, and to say that it is overwhelming every year to know that the need is so great and yet our resources are finite. But I do sincerely appreciate the work of all the agencies and committees and staff who go into helping bring to our attention the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'most pressing need so we can triage these items, if you will. And I congratulate you for that. And if we do, we have any further comments. And if we don't, I'm going to ask for that. We approve this Housing and Community Development Needs statement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. With the amendments. As noted, that motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, who's. Who's moving?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, I'll make the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, who's second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure, I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. We have a motion in a second. All in favor. I. All right. Motion passes unanimously. Thank you, everyone. All right. Moving on to item six C.'",

By amending the general plan designation from office to open space and by amending the zoning ordinance from administrative professional district to open space district and consider the following options.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'days later, which is why we're here tonight. The report is attached as Exhibit one and city staff and the consultant are available to any answer any questions about the impacts report. But basically to lay out what is before council, you have two options tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can call an election or you can adopt the ordinance. If you elect to place the measure on the ballot, you have two more choices. You can either go at the next general municipal election in November 2020, or you can call in a special election.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That special election has to be called within 88 to 103 days, and the election date that we would be able to use would be Tuesday, April 9th. And. There is a new provision in the law that allows the proponents to withdraw the petition up to 88 days before calling it before the election takes place.'",

The next things you need to consider in proceeding with calling an election would be to look at the ballot question, which is limited to 75 words, and decide any'",
        "'speaker_4': 'interest in authorizing or authoring an argument for the November election. You can postpone that until a later date. If you're proceeding with April, you would need to make that decision tonight. In addition to this item, there are two more items six D and six E on the agenda that are related.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Staff has prepared six D as a supplement to the initiative to require a funding mechanism, and then six E is a competing measure to allow the voters to uphold the council rezoning the property recently. And then if the competing measure and this measure were both placed on the ballot and both passed, the higher the one that receives'",

All three of the ordinances are the resolutions allow a mechanism that if proponents do reach that agreement and do withdraw, the these resolutions would be null and void and wouldn't go forward'",
        "'speaker_4': 'on an election. So that's the basics. And I can answer any questions and also staff and consulting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So, counsel, do we have any clarifying questions of the city clerk, Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who drafted the ballot question? The legal staff and staff worked together. We worked collectively, a group of us then and reviewed different options. And does council have an ability do we would we have to approve the ballot question tonight as drafted?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, especially if you're going on the if you selected the April election date, you would definitely have to approve that exact wording tonight in it. Like for the previous rent initiative that was on the last ballot, the council approved the wording but then changed, kind of looked at it and brought it back at a later date to'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Any further questions, Vice Mayor? Not quite. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Interim City Attorney. The council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Council has the authority to revise the ballot question. This keep in mind that it can't be more than 75 words. And the ballot question needs to be as neutral as possible. Could not be argumentative or. Or obviously not misleading, but it's intended to be informative and neutral and kept within 75.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A question for the city attorney. Is that and does that comport with what the city clerk just told us, that if we're going for an April election date, we don't have the ability to do that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. You have the ability, whether you go in April or November, to try to revise the ballot question. It's simply regardless if you're going in April and you're going to change, it just needs to keep within 75 words and be neutral.'",

When you make the decision, if you make whenever you make the decision to put it on in April, you made it tonight or you made it at a subsequent meeting.

        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Right. Okay. I think the vice mayor had his hand up. Did you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So I wanted to clarify that question. So tonight is the last regular meeting where we can approve this, but we have until Friday and 5 p.m. to actually put this on the ballot and approve the final 75 words or less language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct? Correct. If we want it to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Friday of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Next week, yes. January, January 11th at.'",
        "'speaker_0': '5 p.m., as I recall. Okay. All right. Anything else?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Can can the 580,000. I was a little confused by some of the language in. And I can ask the question, are we talking about just 60 or 60? And here at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's stay on the first one, if we could, just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of the language and I will apologize. I can't remember which one talked about polls being open. And my understanding was that they were looking at an all mail ballot. So can we talk about whether or not this will be an all mail ballot or whether it will be a full on polls across the city?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there are certain election code requirements in order to meet the all mail ballot, and this election did not meet those. So therefore, there will be polls open on Election Day. It will be a map to your polling place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, of course, people who are absentee will still mail in their ballots and have all of that same ability. But it's not going to be an all mail ballot.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'No, it did not meet the requirements and legal staff determined that it could not be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No matter what the timing. Okay, great. And then I have one last question for the legal staff. Yeah, I think one of the. No. I'm going to call it compelling. Not that compelling arguments for this initiative is that somehow the voters voted on W to make this land open space and that all this initiative is doing is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'following in his footsteps. But it's not clear to me that it was ever the entire parcel for this federal. Do we have any insights from our conversations with the space regional park or what or what not about what land they considered the park boundaries that the language of WW was very, very well, it was pretty clear it'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The intent was clear to both the Federal Government and the Park District before Measure WW was placed before the voters in oh eight.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'That would be Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mayor. The subdivision occurred roughly in May 2016. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe I received the quitclaim deed from the federal government.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I was I believe it has a date of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When you look at the assessor's data, you'll see that there's is a parcel number for one. There's an API number, parcel number for one parcel or all of of the seven acres. And that goes until 2015 dash 23,016.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that a question, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Have you have you seen how the APN numbers have changed from 2015 to 20 16 to 2016? Dash 2017 meaning that in 2015, 2016 it was one passel for the seven acres and then 2016, 2017 and that it was then split into two parcels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it looks like, judging by some of the data I've seen, it looks like it's May 2016 that. It's just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And often, if they depend on when a deed is recorded, the assessor's office doesn't necessarily make the change immediately. There's a time lag in there. So that may be the reason why. There is a slight discrepancy between when the quick claimed was recorded and when the assessor's parcel map was modified to show two different assessor's parcels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I appreciate that. Although we probably want to stay away from speculating on things that are not before us. Any further clarifying questions from the council before we go to public speakers? Yes. Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I think we had a discussion about Friday, Friday, January 11th. That's the 5 p.m. for the 75 words. And then if we chose to do a ballot argument, we'd have to do that by January 16.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I think. And then we'd have to decide and write that either here and now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give it to a committee. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Okay. So any further clarifying questions? We do have some public speakers. Okay. I'm going to call public speakers. We have to hear. We have six. We're good. You have 3 minutes each. And our first speaker is Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Spoiler alert. Next speaker is Angela Fawcett, the actress in the actor after that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. To be fair, Ashcraft, members of the city council. My name is Doug Biggs. I'm the executive director of Alameda Point Collaborative. A resident of Alameda, a neighbor of the project, and a frequent user of Crab Cove.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want the same safe community my neighbors want. And I also want a place where elderly and the medically fragile homeless can stay with dignity, get mental health services that improve their quality of life, and saves millions in health care costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'ABC lawfully and dutifully requested to receive surplus property on McKee Avenue for the purposes of creating a wellness and medical respite facility. When we were notified by the feds, we we reached out to and worked with the neighbors on this project, knowing the emotions of the topic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We hired a qualified facilitator to lead meetings with the Friends of Crab Cove to identify their concerns and develop operating principles to address those concerns. Thanks to their participation in that process, we've identified ways to improve traffic flow, ensure quality of operations, and identified ways to minimize loitering in the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that through cooperation and compromise, so much more will be accomplished than through conflict. Last week, ABC issued a letter to the community asking that the initiative sponsors withdraw the initiative as they are allowed to do so by law.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Already the letters gathered almost 500 signatures, and in fact, right now it's more than 500 signatures, including leaders from almost every faith based organization in Alameda. Emmanuel Lutheran Church. Trinity Lutheran Church. Christ Episcopal. Twin Towers. Methodist Grace Church.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Pastoral Center. Alameda All Face Coalition Bueno Vista United Methodist Church. The Islamic Center of Alameda and more. Over 70 neighbors of the project have signed the letter, as have representatives of environmental groups, neighboring schools and the many just social justice groups like Renewed Hope, Ark and Alameda Justice Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Rose Up to defeat Major Cave. While we are ready to run a campaign and confident of winning, we prefer to continue working with Friends of Crab Cove and others to create the best possible project we can. Homeless are literally dying on the front steps of the project site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a project that needs to happen and should happen. The Impact Report is very clear on the serious consequences of moving the initiative forward. And when all is said and done, the opponents still won't get their park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now is not the time for expensive conflict. It is time to look into our heart and into the eyes of those that need our help and work together to move the project forward. The city can help that tremendously by joining our facilitation process and ensuring that we will be held accountable for the agreements we make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that will give strength to the voice of those with concerns that need to be heard. At this time, all we're asking is to pause, withdraw the initiative and allow us to move forward with the project. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Angela Fossett.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. My name is Angela Foster and I represent forensic lab coats. Many have called us heartless, soulless and horrible people. This initiative started from a grassroots movement for justice. We were told we're doing a wellness center in Mackay and there's nothing you can do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a done deal. And the America I grew up. We have rights, a voice. Opportunities for input and to be hurt. In 2008, we were promised a measure to VW, an expansion of the park into Crab Cove Educational Services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And instead we're getting a parking lot and a maintenance yard. International parks may claim they don't want the property, but that is not what they sold to the voters of the city. Through their own words, campaigns and fliers to get Alamitos to support their efforts to give us more usable open space, park lands and educational opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we met with Marilyn to discuss options. Prior to today, we offered a conditional use permit in exchange for dropping the initiative. This initiative is the only voice that we have at this point, and no one seems to be listening to our concerns about Measure WW.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'This is and has always been about open space and park expansion. You can call the Wellness Center for Homeless, but it is still a high density residential medical development in an area and location that does not fit. Bottom line.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is on a single access road that cannot accommodate high traffic activities such as ambulances, fire departments, tenders, delivery trucks and staff coming and going. This has never been the use of this property and the need to shut it down was just a few people picking up the phone with no site visits, testing or studies and instead'",
        "'speaker_7': 'having some discussions going back in time as far as occupancy and declaring no negative impact. How can a 24/7 facility have no impact when the last ten years was barely seen a footprint at the federal? If this council moves forward with a special election at the taxpayers expense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is on you front of Crab Cove qualifying for 2020 election at a minimal impact and expense to our taxpayers. I implore you to adopt the resolution or add to the 2020 election. An initiative is not qualified and the election code to trigger special election for a reason.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you choose to spend up to 700,000 instead of 25 to do a special election, the City Council is liable for that expense. And taxpayers, not French or Kharkov. We do not want special election. I was also told in talks that you had planned on doing a walk and only ballot option and no absentee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to me that's discriminatory to those who would be want to be heard but unable to walk into the polls. But I understand from correspondence that you had said that that's not, in fact true. But this facility is being set up in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is not even being set up for to help the city of Alameda homeless first. They have to be qualified on a county regional level before grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that. Our next speaker is Dr. Cindy Acker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Congratulations. Mayor, vice mayor, all of city council. I am principal of a preschool through middle school in alameda and former president of one of California's preschool associations and former vice president of the National Childcare Association. I'm also a choir director, and I used to sing in a choir in San Francisco in a church whose greatest population was'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And that isn't easy. I know that when I was president of one of California's child care associations, one of the hardest things that I had to do was to educate my community, to face their fears, to work toward the greater good.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I guess what I'm asking is that the council does their work to educate the community and that the sponsors of the initiative also consider facing the fears and pulling the initiative and allowing the community to work together for the greater good of the community to remove the resolution in 60 and to help the community work'",
        "'speaker_8': 'together to care for the seniors, the homeless seniors in our community. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor. And council members like to keep this simple. We were all aware of the first portion being available in 2006. This is the McKay property in 2008 stated in Measure WW 2008. In black and white reference referencing the second portion of the property when it becomes available so the park boundary can be completed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Park boundary under the starbase. It's in the second portion of that seven parcel, which was clandestinely split without public notice in 2015 and recorded by the Alameda County Assessor on May 11, 2016. How many times do the people of Alameda have to vote on this?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In addition to the voter approve expansion 2008 in 2014, the city Alameda Attorney finding section two e states. The expansion of Crown Beach for open space use is the highest and best use of the surplus federal property at Crown Cove.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city and the council members were served with a writ to mandate to correct its previous illegal behavior in order to comply with the law. On December 18, 2018, shortly after, Mayor Ashcraft reached out to us to meet to the to meet, to discuss giving up our voice, to have the people vote for open space initiative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This was not an open meeting, but I felt being bullied in giving up our cause. As a lawyer, you are aware of the State Bar Code of ethics that we need to have our legal counsel present if a deal is being made.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We had no idea. Mayor Ashcraft made a point that the city will do everything in its power to support the private use of this public land and that we are going to lose. 100%, we're going to lose. And if we want to have a say that this will be the only opportunity for our voice to be heard'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So give up the initiative and we will listen to you. I'm sorry. This is not the Philippines. We don't we don't do backdoor deals. We cannot be bought. And we are standing up for the people that voted with Measure WW 2008 2014, a 2018 Open Space Initiative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We matter. Our voice matters even though we do not have deep pockets. I am so tired of people in power to change their own rules all of a sudden to serve outside money. So tired since the seventies. Adopted 2018 Open Space Initiative, just like you did with the first portion with Open Space Initiative in 2014 and have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'zero cost to us. Instead, you are driving up the cost of the special election to support private use instead of public. You said this land. We grew up a lot of families that grew up in the seventies. We ate our food.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We fished our food on Crab Cove. We were free to be to do anything. Our slip and slides with no no other things. We still have families that the fish out there for their food so they could afford the rents here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Eric Strimling.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening again. Yes, people do have freedom to speak. And when you speak, people are free to speak back. When you devote yourself to preventing homeless seniors from getting the convalescent care that they need, people are free to tell you what their opinion of that kind of behavior is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And not just people, but community groups, not just community groups. But churches can come and tell you that working against the interests of homeless seniors who need convalescent care is not a good thing. No society anywhere says that's a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The right thing to do is to withdraw this initiative. The right thing to do is to work for a legitimate open space. This is not open space. This is a space with nine buildings that are contaminated. This is a space that would cost the city many millions of dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You mean made into an open space? The alternative is do nothing. The standard NIMBY line, do nothing. Change nothing. Go nowhere. Not good enough for Al and me. That's not who we are. Certainly not who you are as a city council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know all of you. You are not a group of do nothing people. Let's move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr. Strimling, we have Elizabeth Middleburg, our next speaker. And our final speaker on this item, unless there's someone else who hasn't turned in a slip.'",

I am a chaplain and therapist at a retirement community in Oakland and a resident of Alameda. I was at Walgreens this morning at about 630 where the police just had arrived because there was a man sleeping in one of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'their bathrooms. And of course, that can't happen. But they pulled him out and it was an older gentleman and he shuffled out into 32 seven degrees sweater, probably not knowing where to go or what to do next. I think we can do better as a as a city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we don't need to have people out in the cold like that. I think it's an amazing project that is about to get started. I'm in full support of that. When I walked up to City Hall tonight, I saw the sign Happy Kwanzaa.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The theme for Kwanzaa actually this year is to have a commitment to an inclusive good, to have a commitment to make the good of all accessible to all people. And I fully support that. If we say happy Kwanzaa, let's let's get with the theme.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I know the people that were. They'd have the. Of whom we were requesting to pull the the ordinances I have left in the meantime, but I'm still in favor of moving forward with the project.'",

I did, in fact, sit down with the two proponents of the project, Angela Fawcett and Lisa Gambaro Morris on a Sunday almost'",
        "'speaker_0': 'two weeks ago. During the holidays, my children were both home from out of town and I would have liked to have spent time with them. But to me, nothing was more important than trying to make this project put it on the right track.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I spent almost 2 hours with the ladies, and I wasn't a legal negotiation, but I did indeed tell them that rather than engaging in a zero sum game where one side wins and the other side loses, that they had done a very credible job of advocating for the concerns of some of the neighbors and some'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the businesses in the area, and that I respected that. I also am very grateful to Debbie Potter, our economic development director, for engaging the services of a facilitator, a very capable facilitator who met at least a couple of times with the Friends of Camp Crab Cove and Mr. Bates and his some of his group to try'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to find that middle ground. And I work as an arbitrator for the Better Business Bureau. My mantra has always been, just keep talking as long as we can get both sides to sit down and talk. Maybe you don't agree, but hopefully you listen to each other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's all I can expect of anyone. I don't have that magic wand to make you. Do you know what I want? And I'm. And I'm open. And what I tried to say was that there is compromise. If we're asking something of the Friends of Crab Cove, we have to be willing to give up something in exchange'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And that was the suggestion that they could be a part of helping fashion something akin to a conditional use project. So I will step off my soapbox, but I needed to get that off my chest. And I will ask which council member would like to start for Councilmember Vela?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also that there was no Brown Act violation with you conversing with Council. I want to I would like to put that on the record that they.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, they insinuated that you had said something along the lines of the full weight of council behind it. And I just want to put it out on the record that, you know, I haven't talked to any other council members about this or about my opinions on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I certainly think that if there's some sort of. Feeling out there that the council's mind has been made up or that we've discussed that all of our discussions are being held publicly. That's why we're having this on an on a public agenda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I had a couple. I guess there were a couple of things that were raised that I do want to address. One is the the issues with Measure W, W Measure W W was put on by the East Bay Regional Parks District.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was not a city of Alameda measure. It was an East Bay Regional Parks District measure. They have their own separate board. They have their own. There's a Citizens Oversight Committee that oversees the expenditure of Measure WW funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If this is purely about Measure WW, there is a public board of elected officials that can be held accountable and should be held accountable. If if members of the public feel that way. They have public meetings. They also have liaison meetings with them right here in council chambers that are open to the public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so if there are issues that are related to measure. WW whether it's what you're getting out of measure. WW The parking lot and the use of the buildings or whether or not this land is within the definition of, you know, becoming available, I think that that's something that is debatable because first what happens is the federal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'government puts it up to see if it can be used for one of its priority uses then and only then if there's nobody that comes forward for those uses. One of those uses is actually the use that's being proposed by Alameda Point Collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if no one had come forward, then it would become go through a surplus process that would eventually make it open to the Park District. So I think whether or not this land is quote unquote, available for East Bay, regional parks is up for debate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I also think if our constituents are feeling like there's some sort of misuse of WW funds, that I certainly encourage them to work with and speak with the East Bay Regional Parks District Board and to come to the lease on meetings that we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's additional costs that aren't just related to a special election. Those costs, in my opinion, are the types of things that we also have to consider, because what we're being asked to do by this initiative is essentially have the city find a way to commit resources to take this parcel which comes at a cost itself, and then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to turn it in from one thing to another. And there's this notion out there that if any sort of property is not being used, that it's somehow open space. And it doesn't matter whether or not it's public land or private land or what type of public land.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we get these comments that come forward that say, well, it's it's it should be open space. It's just not being used. It can also be urban blight. And that's what this parcel has essentially become. So we just went over CDBG needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We talked about what those needs were. A lot of them had to do with seniors. And a lot of them had to do with housing security. And I would think that end of life care has got to be up there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, I think I would have liked to have seen us reach some sort of resolution and not have to put this on for an election. But at this time, I can't support adopting the ordinance, and I would like to pursue the second option of submitting the ordinance to voters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's a misnomer to say that it's on us to have this special election. I think we've tried to avoid it, avoid a special election, and that's why we tried to facilitate conversations. But those additional costs add up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as we saw with the Jean Sweeney open space, those costs have grown over time from what we initially thought. Things like construction costs increase. They haven't those costs haven't gone down. So I think that there is a worry, at least on my end, if we wait and we might save a little money putting it on that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'general election, what other costs are we accruing in that time? And when I look at the city budget and I think about our fiduciary obligations, I have to weigh that in making my decision of if there's other hidden costs that are going to outweigh the special election.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also think that this is something that we need to call the question on, because if we're not going to be able to do this project here again, what we just heard in the last agenda item was that these needs exist and that their top needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if it's not going to be possible or feasible here, we need to know and we need to plan. If the voters disagree with us, then essentially we need to find a way to get this project off the ground somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, again, construction costs add up and that's why I'm leaning towards supporting a special election and not a general one. And I do think that there's a financial and fiscal issue that benefit to having it early. But I would like to have an opportunity to weigh in on that ballot question, because I found it to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a little confusing and hard to follow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember de SA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, thank you very much. To me, the issue is straightforward, not simple, but as straightforward. Over 6000 residents took the time to sign an initiative which. Which means that they want to see this put to a vote. So I think it's incumbent on this city council to respect the wishes of the 6000 people who want to have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this voted. Now the question then is do we do it on a special election basis or do we do it in November of 2020? To me, again, it's straightforward. If it's going to be put to a vote. You know, at roughly 600,000, $630,000 for a special election, that is just far too costly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we're going to do it, then the most straightforward, reasonable thing is to simply put it on the November 2020 ballot. You know, this is not a simple issue. I mean, this is a very difficult issue involving the lives of of of people, not just Alameda INS, but people from from the region.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if we focus on the key things, the key things are people have gathered signatures to put this to a vote. So let's put it to a vote and let's have the residents vote. But in doing that, let's have it on the November 2020 election.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a lot of issues between now and November 2020 that we can vet. But one thing we know for sure is that if we do it in April of 2019, you know, we're going to be spending $630,000 or so that we the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just do not have for a special election. And I don't see a compelling case as to why it has to be done on a special election basis. I think the cases that and it appears to be that's something that the Friends of Krabbe cover asking for the November 2020 ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Who's next? Council member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I'll go next. And I'll just talk about the first two things. And if we decide if we do, an election will go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Into the decision tree here. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I won't use up all of my time. I was struck by the comment. I think it was, Elizabeth, that we can do better as a city. I think that really resonated with me. And I don't think we have a choice here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to do in favor I'm in favor of having the election and not adopt a resolution. But, you know, this is going to be bitter. I mean, we've seen it and on the blogs, we've seen in the newspapers, we've seen it here in chambers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, we don't really have a choice. And I hope it doesn't come down to the fact that we relitigate WW because my colleague, Customer Mirabella kind of walked through it. I mean, I can't put myself in the shoes of what East Bay Regional Parks did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we can't be, you know, held responsible for what ever they told us truth or untruth, you know, in order to get us to vote for that measure. I voted for that measure. I remember. But, you know, we only he can do what we can do to take care of the people that we can take care'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of. So. I read these earlier and I wanted to read them again because I think it's important that we we remember what we just passed as a priority. We passed this unanimously for our community needs, for our CDBG, which I think represent the values of our city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the second one there was homeless, preventing homeless and other housing crisis. Now, this this is a solution to help meet that goal. Increased housing opportunities for homeless and extremely low income households. This is an opportunity to meet that goal and most importantly, deliver supportive services to promote stability and independence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what this entire project is is devoted to doing, providing supportive services. You know, people aren't going to be doing some of the things that we we we've heard online. You know, some people are going to be transitioning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some people are actually going to go there today as as it is. So I hope that it doesn't devolve into pitting one side of the community against the other. But, you know, I'm afraid it's going to. But I do think it's something that we need to resolve sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do think it's important that we have clarity. I do think it's important that, you know, we have certainty. This is a project that will go forward. And if it goes forward, it will continue to. Raise money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They will continue to exert costs and they will continue to add value to that property. And again, Councilmember Vela talked about it. You know this. If this passes, it's a it's a taking. And then we have the city will be on the hook for the fair market value of of that property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's nothing we can do to stop the project from going forward. So if we can if we let this drag on to November of next year, then I think our liability is a lot more than, you know, 600,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought I had asked for that in the report and I really didn't see it in the report. But, you know, I think it could be in, you know, the tens of millions. So that's something I think we need to look at, look at, you know, instead of just looking at the small myopic view of how much'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is the special election going to cost, you know, what what liability are we exposing ourselves to if we do let this go to November? And, you know, Councilmember, I'm sorry, my fault Mayor Ashcroft talked about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Years ago that have a long habit. And as she talked about her experience as an attorney and my experience as attorney is, you know, you'd like to have all the time in the world. And maybe we think that, you know, 15 months, 18 months, 19 months is enough time to negotiate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But most of the big deals get done right before trial. So having a deadline, you know, having a deadline, you know, if there's a deal to be made, I hope that people keep talking and people can figure out a solution that we don't pit our communities against each other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, if that deadline is January 11th or whenever it is, I think it's important that we impose that deadline. And the last thing I want to say is. You know, reading the report, reading what East Bay Parks wants to do with it and doesn't want to do with it, reading the implications of of this passing'",
        "'speaker_3': '. This is going to be a homeless facility if we do nothing because it's going to stay there. It's going to become urban blight, and people are going to go in there and sleep just like they did at Alameda Point, that we going to spend millions of dollars to tear those buildings down so we can either do this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the right way or we can let nature take its course. And that's the wrong way. And I think, as Elizabeth said, we can do better as a city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you both. Very sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I may just interject. Moment. I don't want I don't want the council to concede at this point that if this passes, it's just automatic taking of the property in the next item before the council if this moves ahead to an election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the things that that initiative would do if the voters approve it, it would compel the city attorney's office to bring an action in court to determine whether or not there had been a taking and also if there were a taking, what the fair market value would be in order to establish the cost to the property'",
        "'speaker_2': 'owner. So while it may ultimately be that there is a taking and there will be a cost, which we don't know. I don't want to concede tonight that there is an automatic taking by reason. If this were to pass, that will be decided down the road.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Based on a number of different factors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that clarification. Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I ask one question? If we move forward to put this on an, let's say, on the special election tonight, can it still be withdrawn by the once we have voted to put it on? Can it be withdrawn by the by the proponents?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, the the petitioners have the right to withdraw it up to the deadline. So even if the council took action tonight, the the resolution itself provides that if the petitioners withdraw, then the item basically stops.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you. I'd like to thank my my fellow council members for their well-spoken comments on this. I agree with Councilmember Desai. This is straightforward. He and I clearly have a different definition of compelling. And we can talk about the $500,000 for putting this in April versus November.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But what we know is that if we do not move forward with this right now, the wellness center will lose tens of millions of dollars that it already has committed. And that is a compelling interest to me. As Councilmember already mentioned earlier, we just adopted not just things we need, but emergency things we need in our dire'",
        "'speaker_5': 'need of and don't have enough money for this meets that need. And I don't know how we don't move forward to find out whether or not we can meet that need or not as soon as possible. You know, we just ended a campaign.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I got to talk to a lot of people. It just reinforced to me how caring Alameda is for as a community. You know, we sometimes come at things from different places, but for the most part, our community wants to be there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Homelessness was a major issue that was discussed. What are we doing about it? And over and over again, I said, Well, we've got this wellness center. And people are trying to stop it. I do not believe for 2 seconds that this is about open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because it's not open space, it's commercial buildings. This is about stopping a wellness center that is more or less funded and is well needed and well document that need is well documented. For me, I am hopeful that in the next week the proponents of this initiative will see that it is a lost cause to win at the'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And at some point in time here very soon, I'd like to actually ask if my council members will agree. I think there are factual misstatements in the initiative that need to be challenged. This is not going to be an argument about whether or not the voters passed open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we should honor that because that's not what this argument is about. This argument is about whether or not we are the community that we say we are. Who cares about homelessness and addressing this and taking those taking care of those who need help and taking the burden, the hand that we have now.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We've done drafting before. She's really good. And and I and we've I've already tasked the vice mayor and council member to decide they're doing the deep dove into the city charter. So I don't want to pile too much on them.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Certainly. And also, if word get, I don't if there's some concern about also the ballot language with respect to the two other items. If the council's going to talk about those, that also might be inappropriate. If you're going to, you know, want to.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So do we need to do anything to formally establish that we do not want to adopt the ordinance, but we want to go forward to the voters?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's been expressed. I think that the main thing is to continue to add dates and time specific. So that's that's really where I would focus on is trying to figure out what date and time you want to continue it too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then, you know with the new revised ballot question coming that meeting to review.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I think. Bring us up to speed. Yes. The city attorney and I convinced and basically what we think we would recommend is that the council proceed with adopting the resolution, calling the election on April 9th with direction that the ballot question will be amended and return at a date specific.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we would suggest that date specific be next Thursday the 10th and any time after 531 time, the council designee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the reason that you would recommend that we adopt the resolution now is because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In in order to set the argument deadlines and you have to call the election now and then that way and we can proceed with, you know, getting out that notice and having those deadlines set and then getting the information to the registrar so they could compile it on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. How does that sound to everyone? Okay. So did someone want to make that motion or did you have one say to me?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, you can make a separate motion. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I could make that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please. Please do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Up to six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. 6 p.m. would be great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One clarifying question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so. This revised. 25 words. Will that be posted somewhere or there's some deadline on by when which we have to provide that to the public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the goal would try to try to get it done by Thursday, which today? Wednesday. What do you think? Monday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I think we could get it out at any point because technically you could edit that language at the meeting. Even as long as you have the final language adopted at the January 10th meeting, you'll be fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'QUESTION I'm wondering, though, from our Mr. Councilman Rhodes. QUESTION perhaps as a revised staff report would come out with that language so our colleagues can also see the proposed language ahead of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That and that can happen at any time. I could even put out I'll put out a continued agenda tomorrow. And then what we can do is just add that when you have the question formulated, we can add it as an attachment at that point in time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it'll be public at all at the same point whenever the subcommittee decides.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make sure we're properly noticing things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're continuing it and you well, you have the ability to edit the question on the spot even.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the goal is to have gotten there. I think the goal I think we are going to have it properly noticed. I think the goal is to just give everybody enough time to weigh in. They need to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I'm not sure about weighing in because we don't want to do serial meetings, but at least.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll be prepared to weigh in at the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, exactly. Exactly. Okay. So was that motion clear enough for you? Yes. Okay. So Councilmember Ody has moved to do we have a sec?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, exactly. So I ask the question now that we have a this motion. I think it would be fair to to because we've already had public comment on this item. If we were to write it right now, there would be no more public comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Typically, there would be no public comment on that Thursday as well. I think we should be. I just think it would be good to be clear about whether or not this we have public comment is now closed and we are now revising based on the public comment we heard tonight and and whatnot or whether we're planning on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'having it. Can you just if people are going to come on Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. When you continue an item, the public comment has already been closed and you're just continuing the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we can always reopen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You could decide to reopen it. But the typical way is to have the public comment closed in Metamora.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Councilmember Desai, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just going to quickly say that I will oppose this motion because I believe at $25,000, at a $25,000 cost for the November 2020 election, that decision is far superior than spending roughly $600,000 that city hall just simply doesn't have or an April special election.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The second reason is because. While Council members had indicated that that the project proponent is at risk of losing funds if an election was held in November 2020. During the course of his three minute presentation, the project proponent himself never explicitly said he is at risk of losing project funds if the election is held in November 2020'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So no case has actually been made that funds for the project from the sponsors are at at risk. No case has been made from the floor, so I believe that the better decision is to hold off until November 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I respect where all of you come from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Mr.. DE So I think the best decision would be if we could get the initiative pulled, but we'll play the hand we're dealt. Okay, so we have a motion. It's been amended slightly and seconded. Councilmember Villa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I did want to raise one point. You know, there are other funds at risk here. And while we aren't necessarily conceding a taking putting, if this were to be adopted, we have other parks that are in jeopardy. And one of the things that several of us, including myself, had asked for when we heard this at the prior'",
        "'speaker_4': 'meeting was where where would these funds for this new open space park come from? And essentially, would we have to go out and do a park bond? What would the cost of that be? We would you know, where does this prioritize different things?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would this put this ahead? My understanding is this would put this ahead of Jean Sweeney and Estuary Park, two parks that are going to be utilized and are supposed to be used by the entire city of Alameda Estuary park costs, you know, significantly less is already underway, is going to have a number of different uses throughout the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'city and with our partners. And I think that those are concerns that we had expressed at the at the previous meeting. So I get that six figures, any six figures is a large expenditure for the city, but it behooves us to ask where are these other funds coming from?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because if we don't have enough money to host to do a special election, we certainly don't have enough funds to pay for and reprioritize this park or proposed park over other parks that we have that are already under way, including Gene Sweeney and Estuary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I know that it's somewhat difficult to get those numbers together, and we would only have to go off of estimates. But we that was a large concern that was raised at the prior meeting, including by Council member Motor City.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And quick clarification. City Clerk The option to on this item also requires a request that the City Council decide interest in drafting ballot arguments and direct the city attorney to prepare the impartial analysis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So I was suggesting, if you want to make the motion separate about the directing direction on the ballot argument and the resolution contains like language directing the attorney to prepare the impression.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's fine. So then we've got our motion. It's been seconded. Any further discussion? All in favor. I opposed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One oppose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the measure passes 4 to 1. Thank you. Okay. And now we move on to item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to. I'd like to make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sorry. Yeah. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's there at the mayor's discretion to it to appoint a subcommittee of two members to write the ballot argument for submittal at our January 15th meeting. I say no. Our next.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Argument.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The argument against not due to the 16th letter. That's just agenda. Is it for the 15th?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's hear from the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So let's do it this Thursday, isn't it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, the packet for that goes out tomorrow. I guess if the argument could be completed by next Tuesday, it could be on a special agenda with the seven days of advance notice. It just becomes really difficult too for the timing for the argument authors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do. So I just wanna say I do feel uncomfortable putting that on a continued meeting when there has been nothing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I'm not arguing that. I'm just saying it's difficult to get it on the 15th, even. Is that what the point I was trying to make is?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, no. What I was meaning was we continue this item to the 10th. We have no public comment and we bring forth arguments. The argument for review at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me ask if the resolutions adopted tonight, when are the arguments for and against due?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'January 16th, Wednesday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if they're due then and if the council is going to consider if, for example, if a subcommittee were to write the arguments, but once all the council members or a majority of the council member wants to sign that argument against, for example, when we have to do it on the 15th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the council can just delegate the authority to those two people and make a decision about let them even decide who's going to sign or decide now that the four council members in support are going to sign it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they would have to sign it without being able to make edits. That's typically the way it's done. Most recently, we had a little extra time because we were consolidating and we could give more time. So we did get one on, but that was the first time we've ever done it that way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And typically it's just deferred to the subcommittee with letting them work it out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the problem otherwise is that. There really isn't adequate time to draft it and have it on the regular meeting for the 15th. We would have to have a special meeting on the 15th to consider a full council approving that ballot argument against right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the people would only have until next Tuesday to draft it, which.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Always throw my motion. I would be more than comfortable to just add my name actually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, depending on who you were about to suggest, I think this subcommittee I the subcommittee I propose, believes that we can have that language done by Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I did. I mean, I think, you know, I would be happy to put my name to something that I trust you to write something in on the 16th at my name to that without having an agenda. I don't know how Councilmember Odie feels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I'd like to read it before I sign it, but, I mean, I would trust the subcommittee. Yeah. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That solves the agenda problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we don't have to bring it back to the point. You write it and submit it and we can sign our names to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I if I could.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Out of deference to our colleagues who I think if I was in your shoes, I would certainly want to have an opportunity to read it prior to adding my name to it. I think that we can. I'd be willing to work on it to get it back to the city clerk on Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whatever works for you guys and we can just cross that bridge when we get to it on Tuesday. If you guys have it, we'll get it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll make it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Work. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if you formally want to move the subcommittee of the two members and. Yeah. And then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I withdrew my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion. Motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or if you're just comfortable with the direction, that's fine.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Adoption resolution submitting to the voters an ordinance entitled Mackay Avenue Open Space Fiscal Responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Measure at the special.'",

    "Resolution on McKay Avenue Open Space Measure and Arguments for Special Election.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'An American to ask whether or not we could combine this with 60. I think that the discussion will go back and forth between the two anyway, but facilitate a better conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City Attorney. Is that okay with you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Do you want to combine them? You can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So just for the public's no knowledge, we are. Do the rest of the rest of the council agree with that? It's fine. Okay. So just in case anybody who's out there wants to comment on either item.'",
        "'speaker_6': '60.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or 66 is submitting a resolution, the McKay Avenue Open Space Fiscal Responsibility Measure to the voters and six e is a resolution to submit an ordinance, a competing ordinance, if you will, entitled the Carrying Alameda Act that proposes that voters confirm what the city already did as far as approving this use at this location.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So anyone who wants to speak out on 60 or 60, please fill out a speaker slip.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Douglas. Okay. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Um, city. Do you want to just walk us through?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So, basically six d the fiscal responsibility measure is similar to what was done with the alameda beltline. And as the city attorney explained earlier, it compels the attorney to file that suit to make the determination about if it's taking and then figure out a way to pay for it prior to implementation of the initiative.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is supplemental to just try and find the funding stream that is going to be needed if taking the next one is the project that was approved by the Council on December 4th and the reasoning that went with that for the facility and it places that as a competing measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so similar to what happened in 2012 with the rent or 2014 with the rent ordinance that the renters had brought forward, the city put its own rent law that it had adopted to allow the voters to kind of choose between the two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it would be similar to that. And whichever of if both passed, whichever of the two receive the higher vote would go into effect. And I think basically you have the same choices here. You've got to look at the ballot question and then you've got to talk about authoring the argument.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any clarifying questions for our city? SO, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Actually, a question of the city clerk. So. This open space, fiscal responsibility, the six D item. I mean, can we just do that on our own if it passes? Or do we need voter approval to direct the city attorney as this describes?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, what would happen is if the voters approved this particular measure, then as part of that, then the the voters essentially would have said, city attorney, go file an action to find out whether or not there was a take in and what the value is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. But my question was, do do we need that voter approval in order to make that direction? I mean, hypothetically, if it passes, could this council give the same direction after the election is certified?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I mean, you could do that without having it. It's simply just I think the staff sense of it was that it sort of complemented what was being there in front of the voters. So they knew the voters would know that if they if they passed the other measure, there was a mechanism in place to determine what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the value or if the owner would have to be compensated. Without that, they might then they may have a different feeling about whether or not they should approve or not that measure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I mean, the other option is that that is fleshed out during the campaign and the ballot arguments and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think one thing that might be in your favor is just if you take this to the voters in you could say the voters approved this this funding requirement, a mechanism that might be stronger than just the council doing it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I think that was what was done with the ballot line in order to, you know, let the voters make the full disclosure. I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a good point, that courts if it were challenged in terms of this process, the court would presumably give a little greater weight to what the voters approved than what maybe a council had done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So Councilmember Vela so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just to be clear. And there were a couple couple questions that were were asked, but. What we would be authorized or what we would be putting forward is just that there be some sort of court action. Correct. The voters authorize a future election, essentially, that that we would be authorizing putting a ballot initiative forward potentially for funding'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Right. That's part of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where you would be you would be putting forth. If the voters were to approve this, then we would move ahead to approve the act.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Approve the previous agenda item that we just discussed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the voters say the voters approved that. Yes. And then they also approved this in conjunction with it. Then there would be a process to move ahead to find out if there was if there was a taking and if there was a taking the value.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also then there would be a a process that would have to be determined in terms of coming up with a funding source and how that would be. It would depend on if there was going to be a bond measure, then obviously that would take some council action to put that on the ballot, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My concern is we just heard about all the issues with WW and everything else that if what we're thinking about is potentially going the route of requiring some sort of bond measure to fund it, that we say the words bond measure, why would we not say that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why wouldn't we put that specifically in here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it wouldn't because you could fund it from a source other than bond measure. In other words, you could use general fund money or development impact fees or so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here's my concern with that. What we just heard was essentially that we, the voters voted on WW and we the voters thought that it was going to be spent on this and that. And I guess my I understand that it leaves it open, but I think rather than leaving it open, at least on my end, I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would I would. My question is why it is impossible impossible to be as clear as possible. So could we, for instance, just say that what would be required is going to court? Figure out if it's a taking and then going through this bond process, basically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could we narrow it so that it isn't coming from general funds or it isn't coming from other other sources?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that the the only source of funds would be through a bond measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could do that. The concern that I think that I would have is that if that bond measure wasn't passed and it would it would generally take a two thirds vote to do that, then that sort of leaves the funding up in the air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the question is, have you limited yourself too much in terms of where that funding source should come from? And would that would that make the complementary measure subject to an additional legal challenge? Because there wasn't. There was such just one source of funding at that funding was contingent on the voters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It becomes somewhat problematic in terms of knowing that there's going to be a funding source. If you leave yourself some flexibility and options. It's certainly going to the voters would probably be the preferred method. But there might be other options available too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know that you'd want to necessarily limit yourself by this measure to only one source of funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Asked The question that I would ask is if we were to approve this proposed ballot measure and limit the funding source only to a bond or whatever, and it didn't pass, would we be placing the city in legal jeopardy if we were faced with a taking or some other action?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I think that would that would be a concern is that you have now sort of put yourself into a box and then that box wasn't opened. Then what's going to happen next? You know, the property owners are going to say general funds have to be used instead of some other source.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that would be my concern of limiting yourself to one funding source in the measure. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. But this is just really related to possible compensation to the owner. It's not, you know. We wouldn't be forced to spend money to turn it into a park or maintain it or do whatever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. This is simply the to purchase the property. Assuming there was a taking the whole issue about the development of it in in some fashion is a whole separate issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further questions? We do have a couple of public speakers, Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. First off, thank you for combining the two items so that you don't have to hear from me twice more tonight. Appreciate that. And just a follow up to something Councilmember Desai said. I will not Catsimatidis I did not take me up on my offer to meet with him prior to this meeting so I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'could fill him in on the on the history of this project. Also, probably didn't take a look at the lease that was enclosed in the documentation with this, which very clearly lays out the penalties we have to pay if this project goes beyond two years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Delaying this is going to cost us. Very clearly it's going to cost us. With regard to the ballot measures, the additional ballot measures, I will say in our perception, I think 60 or the cost impact study is or cost protection initiative is flawed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you run the risk of if it doesn't pass, then and as you said, if it does pass, then that'll give more credence to going for a to a lawsuit. But if it doesn't pass, it's going to give less credence to a lawsuit and perhaps impact your ability to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Determined if there's a taking. I think it's confusing to voters. I mean, I think the difference between this and Jean Sweeney is Jean Sweeney. That was a grassroots effort that was highly popular. This is paid for signatures on an initiative that doesn't have the grassroots strength, doesn't have any of the environmental groups supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not something the community wants. So clearly, they're not going to vote for them to pay for it themselves. Also, in addition to this, I do think this is clearly this is not about parks. We all know that this is about homeless.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's time that this community make an affirmation in favor of serving the homeless. And that's why I support the Carrying Alameda Act as the companion ordinance in this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And our next speaker is Jeffrey RIDDIFORD.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Mayor, council people and everyone here I live on. My name is Geoffrey Bernard. I live on Central Avenue and I look right down Mackay Avenue. I have a Bay View somewhat. The concerns of the of the of the two people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In opposition to the. Seniors. Project. They seemed possible, but not probable. They talk about the the ambulance, you know, activity and and just total chaos is the impression that I got. What I understand about the project is that it is a it's a support based project to offer people who are on the edge of being possibly homeless'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So to help them stay housed financially. Financial help and mental help. Physical help and access to. Just resources that just keep people on track, so to speak, in life. I went to the Alameda Caring Act morgue recently and I pointed out one of the five resource reports that I think was from the government woman And then I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'looked at another one that was 99 pages. So I scrolled and scroll and scroll and came up with a floor plan. I mean, a plan of the of 3.65 acre lot. It showed that one of the major buildings right next to Neptune Gardens was going to be demolished and then built into some medical help facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the three of the buildings, which are just about the right size to subdivide into. Appropriate sized housing for older people and. And it just seems like a it seems like a no brainer. You've got a whole bunch of people out here that have a program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They've they've got a limited amount of commission. They've got funding. If people are willing to help and I think the island as a whole is willing to help the not in my backyard influence I find the most disappointing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because. You that that feeling. Shows that people don't care about other people. And if more people cared about other people, things would be a whole lot better. Thank you for my time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. So. I think it's worth having the discussion of not only what should be in a fiscal responsibility measure, but whether we do indeed want to put that on the ballot. Does anyone want to weigh in one way or the other?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Vela I have concerns about putting. I found the wording to be. Difficult to follow. I think as a concept, I think it's very nuanced and I have concerns about putting it on the ballot because I think it detracts from the larger question at hand, which is, you know, which is the question that we're going to be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'working on revising for the for the other measures. So I also think that since we do have the ability to give the direction to our legal counsel to to do just this. My question is, can we give that direction now?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like, could we could we say in the instance that that other measure passes and that way it's been notice to the public, we can refer to it in our ballot arguments, we can refer to it in campaign material, and we can say that that this is the process that will be followed based off of council ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I hesitate to add things to the ballot that we can do through an act of council direction. And I think that this is one of those times that I think the council can can make that informed decision and give that direction, and we can give that notice to voters in a timely fashion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Anyone want to weigh in on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I like that idea. I mean, I asked the question but didn't think about doing it like preemptively. So I'd be supportive of that. But I don't I don't really want to put this fiscal responsibility measure on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone else? Vice Mayor. Councilmember. They saw.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For me, I think I would lean on just not putting this on the ballot. And I guess I would like to hear a little bit more about what we gain by giving that direction tonight. I think it almost opens up the well, we can vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They'll figure it out in court later. Kind of argument. I would personally, if I had my druthers, I think I put the carrying Alameda act on there and I think it's I'm comfortable that our coverage, the conversation our community should have is do we want to take care of the people we say we want to take care'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of? Or do we want to pretend we're going to knock down 11 buildings and open space in a place in a functioning commercial, federal commercial area for for many, many years? I think in that I think that's the cleanest to use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember de sucks up really the most straightforward conversation we can have with the community. We can give that direction, but I'm open to it. I just don't quite understand why we would get what we gain by getting that giving that direction now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai, any thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Since I don't support a for a special election, I think it's for for me, the issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you're neutral on this or. Oh, well, I won't put words in your mouth. Okay. No. Okay. No. So I. You so I, you know, in thinking this over, I know it's. Well, we're we're doing a special election, so these would be all the measures there are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I still do think that giving voters three measures to consider could be complicated and could be confusing. And I do I'm very much supportive of the Kerry Alameda Act language. And I think to the vice mayor's point that we we do want to take it to the voters, to the community to say, you know, here's the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'problem we face. Do you want to help solve it or not? So, um, I would, I would be supportive of, of again, I thought Councilmember Vella made a very good point that, um, she's hesitant to go to the voters with an action that the council could approve or could, could give direction to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think in this case, less is more. And we can be simple and straightforward with the measures we do put on the ballot. But that's assuming that someone wants to make a motion not to go forward with the, uh, fiscal responsibility measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do have a question. I. Councilmember De Saag had said that since he's not supportive of the April special election. But I think whether or not the special election is in April or it's a question put in November, we still have to decide as a council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't think that I do think whether we take that vote tonight or at another time. I would like to hear from all my colleagues about their thoughts on potentially how we would go about funding this. So perhaps tonight isn't the night for that question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I would I would like to hear from everybody on that, because it's a concern that I have. Relative to the carrying Alameda language. I guess my question is, are aren't these questions that we could tie in to a valid argument specific to the first measure that that we voted to put on the April 9th, 2019 special'",
        "'speaker_4': 'election? And because I think they go hand in hand again, I worry about confusing voters. And are we. You know, we're asking them a negative and one and then a positive in the other. And I, I just worry about that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So to continue the discussion, my feeling about that is a good question. I think that it's important to let the voters know the action that the city council has already approved and and to spell it out. I think that having the two measures side by side gives a clearer choice that I think maybe not all voters get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all the way down to the ballot arguments as hard as we're going to work on it and going to be standing. But the but they will presumably read the measures before them. And I, I, I like the way that it was worded and spelled out because I thought the language told the story.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not to say that we can't, you know, do a little wordsmithing if we feel it's necessary. But I'm inclined to. Keep both on the ballot. That's my opinion. Those are your thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So all three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of the I, I did say earlier and that the fiscal responsibility measure, I think could add confusion. But I like the the the match, you know, the two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let me try. Emotions, if it gets anywhere. If it doesn't, we'll do something else. So I would vote to not a motion that we don't put the McKay Avenue open space fiscal responsibility measure on the ballot and that we instead direct the city attorney as the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As the wording of that proposed ballot initiative directs. So if it passes, then we would authorize the city attorney to do that same thing that the ballot initiative would. Okay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Are we? You can do something separate on the carry on. Me too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I didn't even speak on that one yet, so. Oh, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So. So we have a motion second.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll second it. But I do want to hear from the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As I understood the motion. The motion is not to put on the. You get what is called the other. The other, the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Resolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That the council would give direction or the council's direction would be as part of that motion that if the citizens initiative passes, then the city attorney's is to is to file the action in court. Within a six month period to determine whether or not there was a taking and to determine the value, etc., as the bee and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the other resolution would have provided. That's the gist of what the Council member already said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the reason I made that motion. Yes, correct. The reason I made that motion because I think it would give the writers of the ballot argument, you know, another possible angle to approach it with if they chose to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we don't really have done it because that's within our purview. So it didn't seem to me worth, you know, spending that time and possibly confusion, you know, for something that we have within our authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's what it's a again, I'm I'm unclear why we are what we think we're getting from this. I understand the were giving this direction but to me the the the the. Proposed ballot language was the the importance of the fiscal responsibility ballot language.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Was that it that the voters would say don't enacted until the money is found? Right. And so the direction was given in order to figure out how much money it was so that there would be. You know, is it a taking and how much is it going to cost us before that kicks in?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To me, giving this direction now just feels like we're giving direction for some work. But. I'm not quite sure what we're getting and why we're making it now rather than in four months. Five months, once we know the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The results of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So to respond to your question, also good question, by the way, people good discussions tonight. I, I don't think they're mutually exclusive propositions that we can give direction to the city attorney now and perhaps also fold in information about the costs, in argument, in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To the to the measure or, you know, somewhere in what we're still going to draft.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I am sure it's because I'm jetlagged. I'm not I just am not understanding maybe what is being proposed. It sounds like we're basically saying if this thing passes, the city attorney should then go to court and figure out how much it's going to cost us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And are we, you know, in our we liable in terms of taking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bill, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think my concern would just be it would be another item that we have to then agenda is have another set of discussions on post election, which I do think again one of the questions before voters that's going to be discussed is where is the money going to be coming from?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's the question that has come up more than once. And so, you know, I think it's prudent to say, look, we counsel. Would like to know one if this is taken. And two, you know. If it is a taking, what what are the costs going to be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then how are we going to go about funding those costs? I think it just outlines for the public what the process would be, which sounds like that would be the process that we would follow anyways. Passes, I guess my whole thing is why put off the inevitable when we look right now?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because it's already agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while I appreciate that something similar to what is proposed in item six D was done with the Jean Sweeney Open Space Park. I think there are also some distinguishing characteristics or not. They are not the same situations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I do believe we have emotion and. It's someone I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Suck. And I'm happy to hear more from the vice mayor about the concerns or perhaps the city attorney could weigh in about what we would potentially lose or gain from from giving that direction tonight. I just my concern is if we've already agenda is that why not give the direction it then gives that that power to you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to take that action otherwise have to agenda. In the event that that measure passes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is actually an interesting question. Has that question been agenda? What was agenda ized was should we ask the voters to give us and I'm not trying to be problematic often you said that I'm not sure that we did.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Agenda is giving me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Direction and so maybe some legal action. We can't vote on that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or maybe there's a special meeting on January ten.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I recall of the Jean Sweeney initiative was that Jean Sweeney, her great credit ad, obviously found that pass that large parcel and then went about the process of declaring it an open space area and out of an abundance of caution, what the city council had done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe this is what happened was the city council said that the Jean Sweeney initiative would not be enacted until and unless funding revenue sources were found. I believe that's that's how it went. So this whole discussion about taking or not then becomes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I would just add that that is one of the features that distinguishes this item from from Jeanne Sweeney. Unless.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unless the railroad wanted to make a ticking clock, but that wasn't what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was about doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, but they lost.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But they.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lost.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They lost, right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because because, you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Before they caught.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So but I do think that the the noticing issue is a valid one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's a valid point. I mean, I think I think one could reasonably argue that it's within the ambit of of the of the measure. And certainly the idea that the city attorney would be given direction to do something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you're right, there's a distinction between the voters doing it and the council doing it. And in light of the fact you're going to come back on the 10th anyway, why don't we just play it safe and just sort of add that as a separate agenda item?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You could take action tonight not to put the Fiscal Responsibility Act, if that's the council direction, but we will defer the issue about giving direction to the city attorney. And then the other measure passes and to the 10th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that way you have more time to think about whether the vice mayor's issues are should be followed or or not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'QUESTION Councilmember Thank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You, Madam Chair. I mean, I'm okay with that, but I'm still I mean, I don't see how we resolve the agenda using notice thing by just kicking it to the 11th or the 10th or whatever it is. Well, I think you were talking about adding a brand new agenda item to a continued meeting, which has already been'",
        "'speaker_3': 'noticed. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we'll, we'll, we'll put it on as a special, a special meeting item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the 15th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, on the 10th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, okay. All right. That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will just do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, if we're if that's our concern, then we need to make sure we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do it right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do it right and not, you know, like. Try to squeeze around all into a square peg or something. Councilmember Square peg.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whatever we go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Through, through the chair, if I could suggest to the maker of the motion a possible amendment, which would be to actually move this item to the 15th, because I think that that would allow it to actually be. Properly agenda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel better with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would feel more comfortable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right, so I'll revise the motion to continue. I'm sorry, Madam Mayor. I didn't call on. They call it in, as they call it, revise the motion to not put it on the ballot. And then agenda is actually giving this direction to the city attorney at the special meeting on the fifth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which would be noticed with.'",
        "'speaker_4': '1715 making it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The 15th. So does that work? Okay. It's again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's past the deadline to call the election, but you're not calling an election. So since you're giving direction, it doesn't have to be done by chance. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That wasn't my question. It's that the agenda goes out tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will you be meeting? Could be next Tuesday with seven. So instead of going out tomorrow for the regular meeting 12 days in advance, it would go out in a special meeting for that same date of 15 foot, which is seven days advance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, it doesn't it doesn't. I'm sorry. It doesn't solve the problem. I notice it. But if everyone feels more comfortable, I'll make that motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So. So we have the motion to continue this item. Yes. To a special meeting on January 15th. It's been moved and seconded all in. I opposed. Abstain. All right. So we have four yes votes. One abstention. The motion passes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now. We still need to. Resolves this carrying Alameda act. And so we have numerous speakers. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'OC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members. What are your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't have much more to add on this one. I know that there were some comments, but just since I think technically we're supposed to make motions and then discuss them, I would propose a motion to to put on the ballot the Korean Alameda Act.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And as we did with the first item, to ask the subcommittee if they are willing to look at the language to make sure that that and bring that back to our special meeting on the 10th floor for final approval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ACCOMANDO We just got rid of one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ballot and and also to craft the the arguments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For people, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And also to craft the arguments for that particular initiative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to look to the city attorney's office to help us with some initial framework that we can work from.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct some.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the question could live the legal requirements of the ballot question. The advice on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's similar to what we did on the sales tax measure is what I'm what I'm suggesting with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Point of clarification. So the. The belt is 75 words has to be done by Thursday at the ballot argument doesn't have to be done until the following Wednesday.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's do the following.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Well, okay. So we would do that on the 15th is right. I thought you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Said the ballot question on the 10th ballot. We could do so. That would be the same timing I would propose. I'm sensing some reticence from your fellow subcommittee member taking on too much. I don't. And and another councilmember, Dave Saag, has kind of expressed a interest in staying away from this a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know if Councilmember Odie would be willing, but I'd be happy to find some time to work with somebody. And he thought he was going to duck being on a subcommittee, but it would really only be one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Change is how I'm going to vote on it. I'm fine. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's a fair question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's. I mean, if that's okay with the mayor, I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then for the subcommittee on the Carrying Alameda Act to be myself and Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, is it or that that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why you are me and John.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am afraid if you would like it. But you're trying to spread the spread the word for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It could be, you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know, I think we're going to let council member Vela that that's good. We've we've we've divided up nicely. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've got so the ballot question and the arguments will be drafted by the subcommittee of the vice vice mayor. That's why I didn't. Councilmember Odie, is that under.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That motion, which hasn't been seconded yet?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I just want to get into the motion, but. Okay, so it's been moved right here. Have a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll second that so we can discuss it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And further discussion. During.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then why did. I'm sorry. I didn't want to comment on this because I didn't talk about it earlier. You know, we've heard some, you know, folks up here talking about how they've gone around the city recently and talked to a lot of voters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did the same thing. I talked to a couple thousand people. And, you know, besides people speeding down their streets and their kids at risk of getting hit, the one thing that came up spontaneously after that was this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People would ask me, what do you feel about the homeless center? I mean, and they would ask you in a way like, you know, you have to answer because I'm not going to tell you how I feel. So you have to be honest with them and tell them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to a one, none of the people I talked to were opposed. So I know that's you know, it's not scientific, you know, it's anecdotal, you know, but, you know, we were out there talking to people about the things that that they were concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is an issue that people are concerned about. And I go back to the thing we said before. This is about Alameda carrying. So we can talk about that and we can say this is a value proposition that we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a value as a city and our city can do better. So I, I think this is something we need to put on the ballot. We need to make sure the voters understand that this is a clear choice between having these services which are desperately needed and not having them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think my my colleague, the vice mayor was very eloquent, said a very stronger than I probably ever would have. But I appreciated those comments because it's true. This is what this is about. This is about are we going to serve our most vulnerable people or are we not?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we need to give people a clear choice. And to me, this gives them a clear choice and they know what side they're voting on and if they're going to stand with the values that we share or they're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I will be voting for it. Right. Even though I got assigned to work. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With me. Okay. So we. We have a. A Motion Council member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It. And I do, you know, I think. I don't disagree with the proposition of that's being put forward. I actually agree very much with question B putting forward to voters. I think my concern is just this appearance that the council and part of why I didn't want to be involved in drafting it is we are drafting the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'arguments to the other measure. And so I think it's it's very important to segregate the two things and separate them so that there isn't an. Oh. Trying to use voters. I don't think that that's the goal of this council and also that whatever we're putting forward relative to the ballot question that we would also be drafting for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the other measure is balanced and fair. So that that I just wanted to explain my reasoning for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In addition to the work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, good, very good plan. The fine art of saying no is something to cultivate. Further discussion. Council member and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will vote no on this because you know, I'm all for a November 2020 election. But even when the project proponent, Mr. Biggs, came up and and made his discussions, my takeaway from his discussions were mainly barbs aimed at me rather than getting to the heart of the question that I raised earlier, which was I did not'",
        "'speaker_1': 'hear and I continue not to hear specific. Look wording from him that saying that if this is held in November 2020 that he would lose logic funding. So I, so I, I'm not at this point I'm not convinced I that by that argument I heard, you know, maybe people up here saying it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I still believe that the superior decision is November 2020 when it comes to elections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Anyone else? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I just clarify in question? I mean, I know we are voting to put this on the April election, but you would support it if we were running the last one on the April. And this one on the November.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, this all related to the previous one, which is April 19th over there. There are intimate there. They're intimately related. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess I'm trying to understand just to see if we can if there's anything we can address. Is there is there something about what's being proposed that you have a concern with or literally the timing of it and because it's associated with the timing of the other?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, it's the three issues. One was that, you know, you had 6000 residents saying that they want they want to have this to put to a vote, which we are doing. But from what I might take away from the leadership of that organization is they were fine with the November 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Parallel to that, I did not hear a compelling evidence that that said that the project will crater if it is held in November 2020. So that's why even on this matter, because it was intimately related to item six, the to me it makes sense that it would be consistent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I should vote no. Okay. Thank you. With all due respect. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's fine. Okay. Anything further? All right, we have a motion. We have a second. All in favor. I opposed. Oppose. Okay, so the measure passes 4 to 1. Thank you, everyone. Um. Um. Oh, wow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's true.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're going to go home the same night we arrived.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have next on the agenda. We have city manager communications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No communications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, no communications. You say. Okay. And then we have oral communications, not agenda. No additional speakers, none. And any council referrals this evening. Negative. Okay. None. And so. Okay. So item ten is Council Communications. Council members can address any matter not in the agenda, including reporting on conferences or meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who wants to start on my right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whilst because I put this item, this council compact that the MTC put together. I wanted to share it with the public in case they weren't aware of it. I will be doing a referral to direct staff to come back and report on solutions that we can do.'"
