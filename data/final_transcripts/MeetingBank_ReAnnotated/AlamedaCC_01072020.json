        "'speaker_4': 'To? I'm happy to. Just make a couple of quick comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ahead. First first off, I just I really appreciate that this comes forward. Actually, I think this is a practice. I would love to see some of our other boards and commissions do. The mayor and I had a referral halfway through last year about the Commission on Disability Issues that I think would benefit from, you know, just making'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sure we're all on the same page as to what our advisory bodies are working on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Vice Mayor, for the benefit of someone who might not be following along with, what, five years, do you want to just explain?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So this is a work plan for the social survey, the draft 2020 work plan for the Social Service Human Relations Board for Alameda. And it identifies that our municipal code identifies six key goals that the Shrub is supposed to work on in this proposes the actions that they are going to the actions and next steps that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'they are looking to tackle in pursuit of those. Specifically, the reason beyond just wanting to say, I think it's a great work plan and I appreciate the clear thought and effort that has gone into this. One issue that has come up over and over and over again, not just in the last year, but in the last few'",
        "'speaker_4': 'years, that I think connects to some of this. But I didn't see reflected that. I just was going to ask if it could be considered maybe at the next meeting is we continue to have issues, especially in our schools, around hate, hate crimes, hate language, hate incidents as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there is some confusion, at least among community members as to how that is addressed. Our school district and our city staff do connect at times. It's usually driven by the school district and whatnot, but I think that there's a way for us to formalize and strengthen some of those those processes and whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the trust seems to be a great place to do that, to look at how we can kind of bring those conversations more to the fourth community. It's great that our police department works very closely with the school district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not trying to say that anybody is not doing their jobs, but having we have heard from a number of parents over the last few months, especially about incidents that have come to their attention, and curious how the city is addressing this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think it's a place that the Shrub who took a lead in 2016, 2017 on how to how the city should start looking at these issues, how maybe they can look at the next step of how they can maybe convene some conversations with the district and and others in the city.'",

It's been moved and seconded all in favor. This is recommendation to provide advice and consent on the Social Service Human Relations Board workPlan for the 2020 calendar year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. Okay, that's unanimous. Back to you, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pardon me. Thank you so much. As part of the consent count, you approved an amendment to the employment agreement with the city manager. And that was item five I. And basically to highlight what those changes were, they were approved at the close session last time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you did a 6000 annual transportation allowance, increase the base pay by 3%, the first full pay period of January, and then tied future increases to the executive management group, which will be effective on his anniversary date. So we just needed to publicly announce what those changes were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The transportation allowance.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight, I will briefly review the CDBG program and the needs hearing process for the five year strategic plan and the annual action plan, collectively known as the Consolidated Plan. So what is CDBG?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So maybe I was thinking, okay, now we know the answer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is CDBG? It is federal funds provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the explicit purpose of assisting low and moderate income persons by developing viable urban communities which provide decent housing, a suitable living environment or economic opportunity.'"

        "'speaker_3': 'In the past five years, the CDBG funded programs have served approximately 6000 individuals each year.

And as a reminder that public services funding cap is 15% of the total entitlement. So what is the needs process for the upcoming fiscal year in connection with the city's two year budget cycle?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The needs processes as follows. On November 21st, Shrub heard public comment and subset subsequently prepared. In its statement. Tonight, City Council will hear public comment and adopt the needs statement. And next, the request for proposals for public services funding for the next two fiscal years will be released.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is tentatively, tentatively scheduled for January 13th. So staff recommends that council hear public comment and accept the needs, priorities and objection objectives for the annual action plan. And then I know we've got a few folks here tonight.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And by the way, this is an excellent report. And I also want to give a shout out to Srgb, our social service, Human Relations Board. All of our boards and commissions do wonderful work. But Shrub, when you read the report and see the issues they're dealing with housing shortage, homelessness, mental health, tenant protections, they're they're in the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'trenches and they're our eyes and ears bringing recommendations to us how we can serve these populations better. My question concerns Exhibit four, which is the CDBG priority needs objectives for fiscal year 2020 through 2025. I think these are all laudable goals, priorities addressing affordable housing, homelessness, special needs, economic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My one question is, is it possible to include any metrics? Because how would we know what progress looks like if we're aiming high enough? So for instance, priority affordable housing increase the availability of affordable rental housing for extremely low, very low and low income households in a range of sizes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But is one additional unit, would that meet that goal or what should we? And I will just preface this by saying I spent part of my morning at a press conference for SB 50 SB five Senator Wiener's bill to increase the, uh, the projection of, of housing and including affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, um, another bullet is preserving, rehabilitate existing affordable rental and ownership for households at or below 80% of the area. Median income, that's good. But with no no numbers, no goals attached. Is there a reason for that, or could we add them misfits?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. The goal tonight is actually to develop or identify what the priority needs are. And then when we announce or release the notice of funding availability, then we'll accept applications for that that satisfy or serve these goals. And then with those go with those applications, there will be set goals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what are the applications?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for example, if they're let's give a good example. So I'm going to do a public services example. Okay. And when we announced the notice on January 13th, there will be four weeks for nonprofits to apply for for CDBG funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and these would be groups that say serve vulnerable populations like domestic violence survivors, seniors and other groups faced with challenges to meet basic needs. Is that exactly that? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then with those applications, they will be asked to identify their potential for the number of people that they think target that they can serve. Okay. And we'll set goals accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what about in the housing find? Is that the housing?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for affordable housing, for CDBG, there's two different funds that we use for affordable housing, CDBG and home. The home funds are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Typically used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For actual development or new construction. The last two projects we get about $200,000 of home funds a year, so that funds between one and two units. But in general, the the funds are used to fill a gap in a larger development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In terms of CDBG, the funds are not allowed to be for development per se. So we can use them for preparing reports or for preparing land for future development. And that is typically how they've been used in the past.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, for example, demolition of a vacant building. Could be as long as the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will be used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For affordable housing for the next 15 years would be an acceptable use for.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Those are great examples. Thank you. Any any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember de SAC on Exhibit four. You have a variety of priority areas like in the priority area of non housing community development. You have priorities such as public services and economic development. Also a third within the non housing community development priority area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A third is public facilities and infrastructure. So here's my question. Given the high amount of prices and demand for services that that not just the city of Alameda, but certainly Alameda is facing, do we have any discretion, for example, in saying while HUD and correct me if I'm wrong, while HUD requires economic development or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or public facilities and and infrastructure as air as priorities within that priority area called non housing development. Do we have the discretion to say we want to. Not put money in those in those areas because we want to instead focus our money in.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The other crisis areas. Do we have that kind of discretion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes or no? So there. Yes, I guess the answer is yes. So public services had to explicitly says no more than 15% can be of your entitlement can be allocated to public services. But that is the only there's no area where you could where HUD says you can't put 0%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you could always prioritize other areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Yeah, that's I mean, within public services, by the way, the specific items in there also seem to be issues that address families in crises. So, so so I'm okay with that. It's just the other two things, the economic development and public facilities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, they're, they're, they're valuable things, but perhaps in a time of incredible stress, you know, we need to. Um. Basically conduct triage in terms of how we're going to focus our limited dollars. That's just a thought. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. There, another counselor questions. We'll go to our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The first one is Aaron Scott and then the next one is Johanna, probably at Graham.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Should we have Johanna with Rob? So should she go first.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, members of the City Council. I am Joanna Peligro, member of the Social Service and Human Relations Board, speaking on behalf of the entire board tonight. In 1997, the City Council tasked Shrub to participate in the Community Development BLOCK Grant CDBG process by reviewing and commenting on residents, public service needs and forwarding recommendations to the City'",

And I came to speak tonight in part because, unfortunately, I was unable to attend the sheriff meeting back in November. Family Violence Law Center has received money from the city for a very long time to provide free legal services to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'domestic violence. Survivors were written into the Alameda Police Department protocol. They call us whenever there's a domestic violence incidents. We have an excellent, long standing partnership with the city. So obviously a lot of our programs will fall under that safety anti-crime category.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I specifically tonight just wanted to highlight the intersections between domestic violence and homelessness. So as you consider both in the CDBG context, but then I know homelessness and housing is going to be discussed in many fora by this council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm hoping you consider these intersections when you're thinking about allocation of resources. There's a group now called the National Alliance for Safe Housing that is focused on homelessness and domestic violence. They report that 92% of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse in their lives, and that domestic violence is a leading cause of homelessness'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for women and children. Over 40% of family homelessness. So whenever you're really talking about homelessness, if women are involved, chances are you're also talking about domestic violence, whether as the immediate precursor to the homelessness or somewhere in their past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so if those issues haven't been addressed, then there's likely to be complex trauma that these people are bringing into their experience of homelessness. So having support with the domestic violence and sexual violence that they've experienced is important for future success.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Escaping domestic violence, as many of you I'm sure know, may mean losing housing and income or an inability to sustain housing if they were reliant on an abusive partner's income. And many survivors stay in abusive situations in order to remain housed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many do not report domestic violence and stay in abusive relationships or leave and become homelessness homeless out of a fear about either being deported or losing child custody. And those are common threats put forward by abusers. So again, as you're looking even in CDBG at tenant landlord issues and homelessness services, think about the domestic violence and sexual'",
        "'speaker_6': 'violence issues and the bright spot in that I know if there is one. Yes. Well, so there has been money allocated to a lot of domestic violence agencies to implement what's called a domestic violence housing first program. It comes with usually about half the money you get are low barrier client assistance funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And by low barrier, I mean at least the lowest barrier we've ever had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finish your sentence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So just we now have both long term case management and lawyers working specifically on housing issues because of that money in our office. So when you're when clients are referred to us experiencing domestic violence, they're now not only getting the family in law services, the crisis services, but we've developed more of our housing expertize in-house'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We kind of talk about one because we're doing good work and the second because there's never enough money to go around. So, I mean, $1,000,000 is like a drop in the bucket for our problems. But I appreciate the work of everyone, everyone on Schrum and all of the community organizations that that do all this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I call it God's work. So just one thing I would like to suggest that may be his agenda is I think it would fit under supported services to promote stability and independence. I think we had talked about when we had the heap discussion he being the the money from the state to help homeless is you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know partnering with the school districts to put some type of laundry facilities in schools that students can a homeless students can use to do their laundry. And, you know, I saw an article just last week that in Poway, they they started doing this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think it's it's a relatively inexpensive thing that we could do and partner and, you know, I'm not directing anyone, but I hope that when you agenda is different sources of receipts of funding. That it's something that that's considered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would just say I appreciate the suggestion. I remember you making it before. I would still give you great latitude to try to dictate. Yeah. And, you know, there may be other ways that that sort of if that need is identified in our school district, there may be other ways we can find that many.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It's by far our largest event on the island. Up until now, this event's been coordinated by volunteers, specifically from the nonprofit Parade Foundation. They have decided to earn a well to to take a well-earned retirement from this coordination.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to mention that I'm going to get into the various points. Part of why I understand that the we've had volunteers running this this event. It's been a massive undertaking for them. And it's been difficult for them to find folks to a succession plan and other folks to come up behind them to volunteer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to give you a little bit of context on that. Volunteerism across the United States has declined steadily over the last decade. I was recently looking at numbers. California is actually 47th in the nation on volunteerism.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So get out and volunteer people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel that Alameda as a city is probably that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Data wasn't quite there and specifically on Alameda and so it's really an A and people are they volunteer their time but the average is 52 hours a year. Right. So people are generally volunteering a few hours a month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Generally, they're with their faith organizations, their schools and some and nonprofits. The smallest one of the smallest wages was for civic organizations. So just tell us the story of how it is really difficult in these times to find volunteers willing to volunteer 20 plus more as you get closer to the event hours a week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And part of it also is the Parade Foundation had increasing liability costs and concerns. And I want to ensure I've already had people come to me saying, hey, I want to volunteer. So we would continue. If LAPD takes over coordination of this event, we would continue to have a volunteer committee, and there definitely is still a role'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for that and places where people can work with us on that. And as being the largest event in Alameda and stretching across the entire. And there are significant safety concerns with this event. Event security, as unfortunately we all know, has become a more pressing issue in our society with very large scale and tragic incidences occurring at large'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community events. So it's something that we really need to be taking seriously. Unfortunately, the police chief couldn't be here tonight. He's out of town, but he's been extremely involved in these conversations. And even prior to the retirement of the Pride Foundation, I was working with the police chief and the city manager's office, and we were already already'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in conversations about the need to increase the level of security at this event. For example, in the past, volunteers have been utilized to assist at intersections to help offset costs. And in this we tried it again this last year, and it it it was extremely difficult to recruit and train volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was difficult to have consistency. Plus, it's not really putting volunteers in a fair position if an incident occurs or so they're not trained to that level as a as a paid security company would be. So per per Alameda Police Department, really, there's too many complications and concerns with using volunteers for security and for traffic positions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we as part of this recommendation, we're recommending additional security of staffing due to these increased potential threats and liabilities as seen in other communities. It includes activating the Alameda Police Department special units for higher parade route security.'",

So the company that we are to use that we've been very happy with, it's nearly doubling the number of personnel that they would be bringing out there. So these measures, just the safety and traffic security measures total 109,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently there is 50,000 budgeted in the general fund. So it's a net cost just for security of 59,000. So that's part of and to be clear, that is part of all of the recommendations you see before you tonight, already built into the budget, the city budget as well is the general fund budget is $60,000, half of which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is for public works to put out barricades, to take the barricades back in, put out porta potties and do all of that work. And also for Alameda Police Department for their officers doing parade detail, the officers are also out there helping with setup and both public works and APD are involved in pre-event coordination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So before you tonight, you have three options. We've provided the three options to consider if the cities are taking responsibility over coordination of the parade event. So one is keeping the current route with with Alameda Recreation, Park Department staff coordination.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have a proposal before you of a recreation assistant position. It would be the lowest level position in our department in terms of coordination staff. It'd be super. The position would be supervised by the recreation manager and 25% of his time would be going toward this as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I actually expect this first year because we're getting a late start, honestly, on coordination of this and it takes time to hire new person. A lot of it would be on the recreation manager and then we'd be phasing it in and training a new person with this first option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The total general fund budget for this, including security, including staffing, including other parade costs, part time staff for that day. All total costs is 179,500. And as you recall, 50,000 of that is already budgeted. So it's a new ask financially of about 130,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second option is also with the same staffing level of the recreation assistant and recreation manager, but with a potential revised route. So we put this out just as as a potential cost savings measure. We fully recognize the highest, I guess you could say, historic nature of of the route of this parade.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the but we wanted to provide options. So the revised route would go start at the same location, go down Park Street to end tunnel, make a right, go all the way down and tunnel to Webster and then finish on Webster, as it usually does.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What that does is it removes Otis Drive and removes the well attended Grand Street. So again, we just wanted to put it out as an option, but what it does is it reduces the traffic personnel costs or outside security costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that is a total general fund budget of 158,000 with a net new cost of 108,000. The last option is keep the existing parade route, but contract out the event. Nation of it. We would aim for that to be very minimal oversight by LAPD, by the recreation manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The I want to note that an event planner cost that I put $100,000 in here for an event planner. Cause that's a very rough estimate because we would have to do an RFP and go out and see and bring a contract back to you and see what that cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's an educated placeholder of a cost. So the total general fund budget for that option would be 193,000 with the new general fund request of 143,000. So all just to clarify, all of these options include the increased security costs, which are strongly recommended by staff, including her police chief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All options include a parade coordination budget of 13,000, and that was based on the Parade Foundation's budget. There was actually there was actually a little bit higher. I reduced it down because there was some equipment and things like that that we have in house that we didn't feel we would need to pay for some minimal part time'",
        "'speaker_3': 'staff cost of 20 $500. It does assume continued revenue from donations from businesses. It also assumes an added revenue of adding a small registration fee for additional revenue. We budgeted it, but it's not a final number, but we budgeted it based on $25 for residents and nonprofits and $100 for businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the thought process, that $100 isn't much for the amount of marketing that a business gets when they're taking a float down the entire length of the island. I also want to clarify that all of these assumed that we would be keeping the pre parade race that benefits Midway Shelter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that is part of this total coordination effort. So that concludes my report. I'm open to any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any questions? And do we have public speakers clarifying question just a few minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I only ask this question because I was at I don't it was the last park and rec meeting or the one before where you outlined everything that was on your plate. Can this person will they be able to do more than the parade or with the parade to be basically a full time job?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The parade, we expect, would be about 50% of their time. And it would it would ebb and wane based on the the time of year. Right. So as we start heading into April, it would probably May it would get pretty heavy on that person's load.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But then once the parade's over, they could be shifted over, which actually be great because then it's summertime, which is super busy for us. So they could be shifted over and and the concept because it's the lowest level position would be that this person could it's almost like an entry level position into the recreation field and be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'learning and helping and assisting with a variety of ways in our department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you'd be able to they'd be able to write a little help with all of the things that are on your plate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just a little bit. I think they'd be more focused on the on the operation. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then the 15,000 that was 1920. I mean, I, I think didn't we also have something and in 18, 19.'",
        "'speaker_3': '18, 19, I don't recall the exact amount. It was less it was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was like 35 and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then but 50,000 is budgeted for this fiscal year and next fiscal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Year. And if I remember correctly, I mean, even though we didn't have budget for it, the police chief was spending money out of his like that wasn't in line item. So, you know, we have been spending this money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's just this was the first year we decided to segregate it on the budget. So it didn't you know, it wasn't a hit to his budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're correct. So before that, he spent about 75,000 out of the police of unanticipated out of the police.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So, I mean, that's that's been a few years. So I just want to make sure the people know that we have been supporting this. And, you know, the police have been very generous with his budget, but he may not always have overages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think those are my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think clarifying questions. Vice Mayor. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I appreciate appreciated the budget. I just had a quick question. So historically, there's about $60,000 that it's just been, which I think includes the police in costs. That's not reflected in here as right. Because that that would have been covered by this 50,000 that we budgeted historically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No separate actually from the 50,000 also. So the 60,000 we considered essentially already baked into the budget in the in the budgets of police and fire. The 50,000 is in our Non-Departmental fund and and which is probably where this would live as well, which is under the general fund and is separate from that 60,000 already baked in'",
        "'speaker_4': '. To these costs. The expense costs actually include an additional 60,000, which is already baked in because it's a part of departmental funds. Okay. And then kind of picking up on Councilmember Otis comment, so you explain the 50. Percent time for the assistant, which is the new position.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But this other also has 25% time for a manager who I believe already exists. So this will actually be taking away from a higher up who currently is working. And we don't think that that's going to be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's going to it's it's going to be difficult. I mean, this is this is a huge undertaking. And I'm going to be honest and we're nervous about taking it on. But we recognize the the the the depth of how the community feels about this event.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's an important event to continue. So so we will do our you know, we're going to do our best to manage it with our staffing. Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then lastly, this week or next week at the next Rec and Park Commission meeting, there is they are having another item about increasing park staff. And I'm just curious, we're here asking to increase park staff. How how did how do these two things?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I haven't a chance to read the staff report. I'm sorry that I tried.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no problem. So. So that's correct. This Thursday, the record. So let me back up. Last month and at the December Recreation and Parks Commission meeting, they reviewed the park and made a recommendation on the park priorities as as this body asked to occur.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They and several speakers from Casa Sierra Club came forward and looked at the list. And we really delved into all the different projects and the speakers said, well, we want d paved park to happen and there's too much happening with the level of staffing and we want to see more the commission recommend more staffing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So part of the Commission's motion was for me to bring back a staffing plan on how to manage the projects. All of this would come before you obviously as as so it's just a recommendation. But they're considering my proposal was essentially a middle management position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a senior management analyst I think is the right level to do the project project coordination that that to Councilmember Otis point that's really it's really a higher level position that's needed to take these projects on. And the intention was that I would still manage the high profile and large projects like De Pave Park, but that this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'position could start taking over smaller things like a playground at Jackson Park or other annual playground maintenance and things, a kayak launch at Water Park, so things like that. So that is been a separate discussion from this recreation assistant, the recreation system position there, other 50% time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's actually a position that's been needed that I've been trying to figure out how to fund for for a number of years. Our we're very flat in our recreation department on our staffing. It's myself and I'm really primarily doing projects at this point and our recreation manager for each of our divisions Mastic, recreation services and parks'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And then and then there's for recreation supervisor ones underneath them that do everything right. So there's no one's supporting them. So we're paying someone. It's really not an efficient way to work because we're paying someone at a high level to answer phone calls from parents saying, My kid's not going to be there today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they're really doing this huge range of work that would fit more of a recreation assistant position. So so this is a way that I think we can bolster our services we're providing overall to the city as well as as incorporate the parade management.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kerry Thompson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I'm Kerry Thompson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm the president of the Army, the homeless network, which we do the 4th of July parade or race beforehand. And I just want to encourage you to stick with option A or C, not altering the route, because it does make a difference to the race as far as the distance and everything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I encourage you to support one of those two options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you. And oh, just once we got that interested to, um. Okay. Um, if I could just comment. Thank you for the report. And the parade is certainly a beloved institution tradition in Alameda. When I looked at the the proposed parade route change and for the spirit of full disclosure I live on Grand'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Street, although my life would probably be simpler if I wasn't both in the parade and hosting a parade party that I had to get back to. But it's more complicated than you need to know about. But I do the cooking too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But anyway. But when I think of the parade route and Otis Drive, yeah, it is a more sparsely populated street for the parade, but along Otis Drive are all those assisted living facilities for seniors, including the assisted living facility that prepares the meals every day for Meals on Wheels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And every year on the 4th of July, they will the residents out on the sidewalks. And it is the sweetest thing to see them there. And, you know, and I think the caregivers who are out there and sometimes families also really enjoy that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I can see that we would save maybe $21,000 from the most costly option of keeping it. And I just I don't know, that would make me sad if we would take that away from from those folks because they always look so pleased to see us and I kind of look forward to seeing them every year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is true that the in so many ways the parade looks the way it always has, but it is more sophisticated and it does require more security for all the reasons our recreation parks director Amy Aldridge delineated. So we we do need to spend more money to make sure that that it's a safe event and our crowds'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are safe at the same time. I would never want to see us reveal too much about the kind of security we're providing. Has bad people pay attention to those sorts of things? But our police department is great and they know who to contract out with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, those are those are my thoughts. I think that whatever is the considered the most workable option and I guess I think I'm hearing misspoke. Or is it correct to say that your preference would be to see if you could contract the event coordinator coordinator position out rather than have it in house?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or are you neutral on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we would have more control and consistency if we have a staff person actually, because event planners change, we might potentially, you know, we could do a three year contract, but but they could potentially change. And now you're doing it again back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To square.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One. I think there would be more consistency if we were in-house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thanks for that input. Okay, Counsel, your thoughts on my left? No. Okay, Tony. On my semi left, also my right, Councilmember Desai. Now be quiet on the left or whatever it. I'll leave you out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, the 4th of July parade is Alameda is once a year gift to the San Francisco Bay area. And I want to see us continue. The 4th of July parade is the city of alameda was once a year gift to the San Francisco Bay area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's something that, you know, everyone looks forward to. It's always on the local television stations. So I think clearly we need to keep that going. I prefer option A, I think it's the cleanest. There are costs involved with option A, but the reality, though, is that there has always.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In costs involved. It's just that now we are certainly recognizing those costs. So, so I prefer option eight. Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Others Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor, and thank my colleagues for their comments and know I think my colleague here basically said it all. I mean, that's an Alameda institution since the bicentennial year. Right. And I know I look forward to it every year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also prefer option A because that stretch on Otis. You do get a chance to rest and not not walk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gear up for the for the end. I just want to give my appreciation to the volunteers that have been putting this together. I mean, I remember my first parade and, you know, coming around the corner and we were, you know, entry 130 or whatever it was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there was Jim friends still moving people along. And you know, you're still volunteering at FAS. I have lots of cat pictures. People are sick of my cat pictures.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those words to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You and Barbara Price and Mark Sorenson. And, you know, it's not that there's not a willingness. It's just, you know, it's a thankless job. And, you know, people need to, you know, move on to other things. So I just want to give you a huge shout out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm happy that we if we pick option, we'll will have a full time person. I'm not going to talk about the staffing because that's not in the agenda, but I eagerly await that agenda item. And I do want to again give an appreciation to our police chief, who has taken who has paid for a lot of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this out of his budget, a lot of his budget surplus over the past few years since the Boston Marathon incident. So, I mean, it's we probably won't in the end see a net increase in in cash spent by the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I appreciate that, you know, we've been supportive and partnered, so I'm just excited. I'm glad that we're not losing the the foot race. I'd like to see a bike race added before the foot race because, you know, we don't close our streets but once a year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's something maybe to think about. But again, huge appreciation to Jim and Mark and Barbara and everybody on that committee who's done this work year in and year out. You know, it's tireless work. And I just want to say I appreciate it all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor. Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. Thank you very much. I would also like to just share my thanks to everybody. I mean, the three who continue to be mentioned, but the many dozens and scores of other people who make this happen every year have made this happen every year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I certainly want to preface my comments with that. I don't think that there's a world in which we're going to decide tonight that the parade is not happening. But I am a little nervous that depending on what decision we make tonight as the economy goes south, we could find ourselves in a place where we've found'",
        "'speaker_4': ', you know, this could be one of the first places that gets cut in a budget and impact of impact future parades. I'm a it does it concerns me that we have a budget that's somewhere north of $250,000 of city money that is being spent on the parade.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under this budget, I know that, you know, somewhere around 75,000 has historically been spent. We tried to start trying to budget for this. And, you know, I guess I would I'd like to. Would it be interested in at least discussing tonight would be something where we whether it's option one or option three, I don't think there's there's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'enough savings to even consider option to where we find a way for the city to fund this for the next year or two, but that we actually start working with some of our community organizations the Elks, the Rotary, etc., to see if we can still find some community leadership that might take on the the actual organizing of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the event, an understanding that there's going to be ongoing security costs to the city that we need to budget for. I don't know what that looks like and I'm fortunate. I don't think we have enough time to probably tonight or before the next parade to figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think, you know, kind of adding adding on an annual expense of another hundred $25,000, given all the other things that we're also asking for money to be spent on. I just want to be a little mindful of that outside outside our overall budget discussions as an ongoing annual expense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was going to make a really bad pun about raining on the parade, but that's good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You didn't get to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So have a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Few more hours.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a few things. I think one of my colleagues, Councilmember Odie, said that, you know, it's a thankless job. I think that the key word there isn't actually thankless. I think the key word is job and. Typically when something is an undertaking big enough to call it a job, we compensate people for it so that we can'",
        "'speaker_5': 'depend on it and rely on it. And I think it's become much more complicated than it has been in past years because of the security element, because of the different things that go into it. There there are more considerations that staff are having to work with now, and it's for public safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's also for liability purposes and everything else. And so I do recognize that there's an increase in the workload as well as the overall cost. I do. And I would like to thank all of those who have volunteered for all of these years and will be continuing to volunteer in various capacities because it is a production and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it's a huge production that lasts for many countless hours before the the first person lines up to actually be in the parade to the the vice mayors point. I would be interested in seeing if there's a way to have, you know, sponsorships or naming rights for the parade.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think in addition to looking at, you know, volunteer opportunities, I do know that some other parades get sponsorships. They have naming rights, things like that. If that's something that we could look at here, this is a pretty well-known parade.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do get a fairly large turnout. Um, if we're doing all this work, it'd be nice to see if we could build something like that into it. And I do want to recognize, I mean, the staff vacancy savings that the police department has has put into this to kind of hide the costs for the past few years'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is fairly significant. So it's not that there's a huge amount of money that's now all of a sudden being spent. We're just allocating it separately and not using staff vacancy savings. And I think all of us up here are very committed to making sure that the vacancy savings for our police department decrease over time by virtue of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'filling those positions. So I think that this is also prudent planning. I'm inclined to support option one with the caveat that we we look at kind of other ways of funding this, if at all possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And you know, I'm glad, Councilmember Vella, that you mentioned sponsorships and naming rights because that was something that staff raised with the committee last year in the planning phases. I think there's a lot of potential there, but it's just that by the time you come down to a couple months before the parade, it's too late'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to do that and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Person to coordinate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Exactly. And we have an economic development department that has, you know, good contacts with our business community. So I think those are all things that a staff can consider. So I heard at least a few of you. I heard Councilmember Velez specifically say she would support option number one, which is to keep the existing parade route at'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that was council ready. Okay. So now that's been moved and seconded the option. One option. All in favor I a okay. Was that five eyes. That's unanimous. Okay. Thanks, everyone. Okay. The OC Council. Are you okay? If we keep going without a break?'",

    "Automated License Plate Readers Program Recommendation.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Considered directing staff to develop a recommendation on an automated license plate reader program. This item was placed on the agenda at the request of Vice Fairfax by.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor next week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So my interest tonight is to well, you know, as many of you know, 2018 there was a discussion around the use of automated license plate readers in Alameda that was sent back for additional information on the use of the data setting, some privacy policies, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In our last meeting, we set a number of those policies, including expanding to a surveillance policy. And I know that there's been a lot of interest in that in some aspects of the community to at least have a conversation around automated license plate readers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I brought this referral to find out if there is interest from this body to look at license plate readers and then understanding that there are two different issues. There's the license plate readers which provide real time information about vehicles in cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then there's the second issue what do you do with the data once it's happening? And so there's a spectrum of how we how license plate readers could be implemented in Alameda. And there may be places where the police department and staff feel that there is a reasonable use of them and where they aren't interested in that'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And so I wanted to again see if there's a interest on the council to ask staff to explore how they might propose using license plate readers in Alameda County consistent with our privacy policy, which is not yet an ordinance and consistent with the the San Francisco surveillance ordinance, which we sent to staff for their consideration to bring'",
        "'speaker_4': 'back is an ordinance as well. But in that it outlines a number of reporting requirements for when we move forward with surveillance type technology. So until we have our own ordinance set, it's pretty much the gold plated surveillance ordinance in the Bay Area and probably in this country.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it would be a good pilot for how does this work and how does it inform both the council and the community about the impacts of proposed use of technology in in Alameda? And then additionally, if data is being collected, if we were to move forward with license plate readers, where would we be comfortable having staff consider'",
        "'speaker_4': 'kind of the retention and use and possible sharing of any of that data data possibly providing staff with a menu or a spectrum of of or range of. Sorry. Brain freezing where they were with a range of options for how they might come back and talk to us if they were interested in bringing that back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that is my refer counsel comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Vela Um, so I'm a little bit, um, I had a referral several years ago to get the privacy and data retention, um, ordinances in place. And, you know, one of the things that happened was that our police department asked for an exemption, uh, specifically for, for law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, and well, we discussed that exemption at the last meeting that was not with the thought of Alpers being adopted. Um, so I would like to see what the actual ordinance and we did give instruction at the last meeting about the ordinances and looking at the ACLU model ordinance as well as the San Francisco ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um, I think, Vice Mayor, you were, you were pretty clear on that instruction and helping us clarify that for staff. Direction. But I would also like to see, you know, to have staff come back with both of those, um, and with an explanation of how a law enforcement exemption would interact with this and what it would mean'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Because I do have concerns about, you know, if we're going to adopt an ordinance for privacy and data retention. Um, I would like the ordinance to apply. And specifically part of it is to have it applied to all aspects of government, including law enforcement, so that there can't be, um, you know, abuses, maybe not even by our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'own city, but by vendors who we contract with. The other concern that I have, and it's something that we've discussed in the past, is while there is a Supreme Court case saying that cities are not bound to release kind of wholesale data collected by Alpers, the Brown Act still or not the Brown Act, but the the Public'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Records Act still compels us to release records to people that are the vehicles registered owner. And we've heard from a couple of speakers tonight regarding domestic violence concerns and things like that. Um, I would like to know if there's a way to, to, uh, you know, create a policy specific to checking on certain things, for instance, before'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we do a release, if we could have a policy in place to check to see if there's any civil or criminal restraining orders against the requesting party, that sort of thing. The reason being, you know, I think that we're all human.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our police officers are human. I was in my third trimester of pregnancy when Alameda Police Department came banging on my door in the middle of the night, woke both my husband and I up. Um, and we had multiple officers and there were four or five at our door searching for somebody who was not, uh, living with us'",
        "'speaker_5': 'because they had gotten a welfare call and this individual had a criminal and a civil restraining order against his former partner. And that former individual was, had been very abusive and violent and was harassing this individual and basically was calling in to various police departments, um, saying that this individual was a threat to himself and was essentially'",
        "'speaker_5': 'trying to weaponize the police. And so out of their good intention, they showed up at our house, understandably concerned for the welfare of this individual without realizing that the person calling was literally down the block trying to see if that individual was, in fact, staying with us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, my concern would be the same sort of thing. You know, if if your partner and you're an abusive relationship has the car registered to them, you know, somebody's putting in an information request and getting that information and then using it to stalk the person.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't want us to inadvertently turn over information that could help facilitate that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I had a couple of comments. I appreciate customer vela's comments that I share a lot of the same concerns. I guess the threshold issue to me is, I mean, do we have support to do this? Because, one, this is a tremendous amount of work for our police chief, who I imagine would be the one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doing it. And if there's not a majority that want to move forward with license plate readers, it's a waste of time, in my opinion, for him to do all this work if it eventually gets voted down. So further.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, if it for me to vote on it, I would want this information. So I think that's a prerequisite even before it comes. And, you know, I'm not into setting the priorities of of the police chief, but we do have a shortage of of staff right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know he's made that a top priority of his. We have eight or nine kids now that have been hit since the beginning of the school year. And I know he's made that a priority of his. So, I mean, my question to the city manager is, you know, where would doing this work fall in with those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'priorities? Because I'd rather have our police force working on not having kids get run over and filling vacancies than drafting a report for something that may have limited use or limited value. So, I mean, that would be one of my questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't know. You don't have to answer that now, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So depending upon where the I would agree with you and agree with you, but those are high priorities that you mentioned. My recommendation would be that this would probably fall below those priorities and that we would bring back the parameters you want to see.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then he can move forward with the license plate readers depending upon whether or not the parameters work. But I would do the parameters prior to doing any work on the LP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Because I'd like to see, you know, information on, you know, exactly what it is that we would use this for because I mean, the original proposal was to put them at the bridges and the tubes. And I hear people, you know, I see on Facebook, well, I had a package stolen from my house and we have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'license plate readers. We would have caught that person. Well, no, because we don't know what that person doesn't have a car. So or you know, I was assaulted by so-and-so. You know, a license plate reader would have would stop them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, if you're not a car, you don't know when they're crossing the bridge. And I do have I mean, another example is, you know, so and so, you know, I was a victim of a crime by a a green person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So then if we want to find that green person, then we're scrolling through thousands and thousands of photos profiling a green person. I'm just using that as an example. I mean, that color I know we don't have green people, but I mean that that potential for racial profiling is concerning to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The potential for, um, just the issue with the shooter was not to my tongue, but I forgot. But I'll come back to it. Um, the whole issue with domestic violence, I mean, I could easily see an instance like Councilmember Vela brought up where, you know, someone's the owner of the car, their wife or husband or whatever as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a victim of domestic violence. They get their records, you know, they find out they go off the bridge every day at 933. Maybe they're in hiding. And then all of a sudden, the next day, that person's there, they stalk them, they kill them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, I mean, and then, you know, I have concerns about that. I have concerns about, you know, this data being misused by someone who has a right to that if they own the car, you know, use it in a family law dispute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I used to do that as a as a living. And those things get vicious, you know. And I thought of the other one and I forgot again. But, um. Oh, and I think we were on the verge of adopting this a while back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we found out that, you know, data was going to ice, not because we wanted it to, not because our police were giving it, but because the vendor was doing it. Even though we were we were somehow told that that wasn't happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know if it specifically was for Alameda, but that vendor was sharing data with ice now three years ago. You know, this would not have been a problem. But, you know, I don't know where we're going in the next 3 to 5 years with with data that could be commandeered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, this is a different time than it was three years ago. So there's a lot of things I'd like to see. You know, these examples turn into use cases. You know, that's kind of is something where you kind of lay out what's going to happen in these certain circumstances that we can kind of see and show'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the public, yeah, this is going to be valuable for this. You know, this is going to be, you know, we're going to protect you in case of this or, you know, that type of thing. So I can visualize, you know, how this tool, if we decide to adopt that is going to be effective and how the civil'",
        "'speaker_2': 'liberties of our public, you know, are going to be protected. Because, you know, you could have you know, there's just so much potential for abuse. And, you know, I before I would vote on this, I'd want to make sure that I was satisfied that that that that potential was protected or prevented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, well, thank you very much. I come at this from a different angle. Back in 2013, I believe it was, uh. Council. Lina Tam at the time took an interest in license plate readers. Both of us were asked to attend a meeting at Ruby Bridges Elementary School because residents at the Bayport neighborhood were very concerned about about'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the increasing increase of crime that was going on and saw in license plate readers as a possible tool to deal with safety and crime related issues. I continue to have that perspective and I saw that the City Council between 2013 and 2015, 2016, I think made incredible headway in terms of moving forward with implementing license plate readers'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And we also had an audit report that was issued I think some time in December 2015 looking at, you know, what had been the record of the license plate readers that were put into place. And I believe they were for the four or so license plate readers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They were pretty effective in identifying a good number of vehicles that were associated in criminal activity. My hope is that we return to looking at license plate readers, especially from the lens of crime prevention, of making people who want to come into town, whether they cross the bridges or or come in through the to think twice about'",
        "'speaker_7': 'coming into Alameda using their vehicles to commit crimes. And I think license plate readers does that. I think there's been some considerable evidence that crime has reduced been reduced in the city of Piedmont because of license plate readers that were placed there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think they had expanded the numbers just recently in terms of issues of what you do with the data and in terms that particularly with regard to civil liberties, I believe the city of Alameda had a robust discussion around data, data management and, uh, and I think that certain policies were in place if they need to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'be tweaked and they ought to be tweaked. But in my opinion, I believe we need to get back to implementing license plate readers where we can within the budget that we have. Um, that's my perspective. I think it's a, it's first and foremost a crime prevention tool in a time of great changes in and in the region'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and in Alameda. I think this is one way of making people feel safe and secure when they come into the city of Alameda. And I think we owe that to the residents of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Desai. So here's my perspective. Um, I think that all of us are probably aware of a horrendous attack that occurred in New York State during Hanukkah where an intruder, a criminal, barged into a rabbi's home, a crowded home with children and guests there celebrating Hanukkah pulled out, I mean, a large knife, but it sounded'",
        "'speaker_0': 'more like a sword and injured a number of people badly and then fled in a car and was later arrested in Harlem, which was a considerable distance from this home in northern New York. And the way that that person was tracked down and so quickly, I mean, within hours was because there were fixed license plate readers that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'guests at the party had the presence of mind to get the license plate of this fleeing vehicle. The police came and then that information was broadcast out to jurisdictions and it went up into these license plate readers. And they were able to they ping when whenever a vehicle, a wanted vehicle is located and that person is now'",
        "'speaker_0': 'under arrest and, you know, will be facing charges for a horrendous hate crime, is what it was. So I was on the city council when we adopted the use of license plate readers on a number of our police vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They don't all have them, but there's a certain number of maybe four, maybe half dozen, I don't remember. And there's a policy that governs the use of those. ALPERS And it's not terribly different than I would imagine a policy would be for license plate readers on fixed locations like our portals, our bridges and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The entrance to the tube. I think it's unfortunate and I know it wasn't intentional that we brought this item forward at a time when the police chief was going to be out of town. I suppose we could have delegated or designated someone from the police department to be here to answer questions, because it's not really fair for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'us to be speculating. But I will say and I attended there was a forum that was held at the library. Tony, I feel like you might have been there. Are you Jim? Were you. Okay. But you were in the audience, you know what I'm talking about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there was a panel and there was someone from New Haven. The ACLU attorney was there, and there was a white paper that was published. But it was on the basis of the feedback from that workshop that our license plate reader policy was, was adopted, was, was formulated in adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm sure that rather than throw it out and start from scratch, I mean, I'm sure San Francisco does great work, but we're not San Francisco. I have huge regard for the ACLU. I'd be interested in what they say, and I know we use the ACLU, use white paper and examples in formulating the policy for the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'body worn cameras that our police department also uses. But I heard concerns raised and, you know, valid concerns that our police department is currently understaffed. And so how would we prioritize all this? But I've also heard our police chief say many, many times he would like to have these license plate readers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He refers to them as a force multiplier, that they're what they're able to do is to be collecting data and doing the work of officers manually having to do that or going out on on a bit of a wild goose chase, a retention policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Retention policy is in the current the current guidelines. I haven't looked at it for a while. It's could well need to be revisited. Technology changes, but there's definitely a retention policy there. Now I share the concern that's been expressed with sharing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would be want to be very clear about who does and doesn't get that. But I know there's there's been concern raised about, say, domestic violence victims. I'm more conversant with the of the body worn camera policy because that was more recent in time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are definitely in our policy exceptions for even activating your body worn camera. If you are interviewing someone who's a domestic violence victim, they're very sensitive. They don't want to be on camera, a child victim. I mean, there's there are guidelines to that and there are certainly guidelines to who can access the the the footage from license'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plate readers. It isn't just that the, you know, disgruntled ex-boyfriend with bad intentions can can walk in and get that it is that is not the case. But we'd want to make sure that any policy has those protections, the potential for racial profiling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm confused here because we're talking about license plate readers that are reading the license plate and not the. I know there were other examples of well, it caught a screenshot of the driver of the vehicle, too. These are machines that are capturing the license plate data and so so it knows that that car with that and yeah'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it would capture a bit of the rear or the front of the the bumper. So you might be able to tell the make and model of the car. But using it for racial profiling, I'm I'm confused about how that could happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And certainly this is not something we want to do. But but as far as the civil liberties, you know, we were reminded when we did this discussion previously about license plate readers that there is no expectation of privacy driving down a street or a highway with your car.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't have a right to the privacy of your license plate as you drive down the street. But whatever we do as a council, of course, we balance competing interests. We want to look out for civil civil liberties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to protect vulnerable populations, domestic violence victims. But these are not mutually exclusive propositions. I do believe we can, and I know I certainly get these emails and I would imagine my counsel does to from residents saying, when are we going to get those?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think that even more so now at a time when we are short staffed as a police department, and I don't see that reversing or completely reversing anytime soon because we all know the challenges to filling law enforcement positions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we owe it to our police department. I think we owe it to our citizens to make these tools available that can help make us a safer community. And again, I give you the recent New York example.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have policies in place now. They should be revisited, updated. But I think I think it's time to move forward. And I had just a couple questions on the the wording of the staff report that on page two says the report should include effectiveness in reducing auto theft auto recovery.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to add should include but not be limited to because they're I mean I'm I don't do police work but I would imagine there are other things that license plate readers could help in in in capturing like a terrorist, you know, a hate crime that was in New York.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, that's not auto theft. That but that was that was a very important arrest that was made possible by an LPR. And then I, I was confused about the next to the last bullet on the second page, which says the report should include information on the level of interest of Alameda Police Department leadership in proceeding under'",
        "'speaker_0': 'each of the identified scenarios. And is that what what did you mean by that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just think there would have been a sub sub bullet of the the bullet above it, which is options for addressing. So, you know, what options would we be if we were interested? Well, if we were interested in moving something forward and we had, you know, some members who were interested in just real time know, warehousing, etc.'",
        "'speaker_4': ', that might be one thing we say, hey, please, you know that. You know, city manager, when you come back, look at this option. And another one might be right. This spectrum sharing your data with everybody in the world and not caring about who uses it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not that I'm proposing that. You're right. Yeah. It may be that the police department says, you know what? Real time license plate readers with no data warehousing, retention and use for detective work in the future not interested in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what they.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Said at the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So, you know, I think that there are there is a spectrum of what we do with that data. And to your point, there is probably some places where there's probably some places where all five of us are like, yeah, let's, let's, let's move forward this and the police might say we're not going to spend half a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'million dollars on that. It's not worth it. So I think I just wanted to well, I have some comments, but that was for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, and that's the extent of mine. So. Vice Mayor. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, I want to appreciate this. I actually think everybody made comments that I thought were very consistent with what I proposed. This referral is not to say let's do license plate readers. This is to take the temperature of the council and say, is there are there three people who who would be interested in seeing license'",
        "'speaker_4': 'license plate readers under certain under certain circumstances? And what would those circumstances be? I would say that it includes it requests a report that provides information on the effectiveness of. Yeah, we can we can talk about hate crimes and terrorist tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think those happened so infrequently. We have you know, I would I would like to be careful of is getting a report that goes to the hyperbolic very you know Timothy McVeigh you know you could have in court kind of thing which is unlikely where where our community is very much concerned about package theft, etc..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, to Councilmember Otis examples, I agree. I think that there is a lot of misinformation about how useful license plate readers are. And I think that having a well-researched report that actually uses effectiveness studies to talk about where this will work and be useful like it will help us find stolen vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will not likely capture most package thieves. One of the areas that our police department does talk about that I was interested in, it came up in our conversation is a lot of the smash and grabs are being done by crews in and when they and they they work the entire East Bay and they start in Fremont'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and they hit mile after mile after mile. By the time they get to Alameda, they often know that they are out, but they don't know who. But they they can get screengrabs, let's say, from Fremont. And they might actually know as they drive in from High Street that these folks that are going to hit, you know, bridge'",
        "'speaker_4': 'side, south shore, Alameda landing. Read a village and then leave town again. It might be possible whether or not that's going to happen all the time and it's worth the time and expense is. But but, you know, there are some places where some of these property crimes could could have an impact as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to hear from the folks who know better, but I also wanted to be very explicit that I don't want anecdotal. Here's a newspaper article in which some, you know, small town police chief says, we put these in and they were great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's not that's not useful data to me. The surveillance ordinance from San Francisco. So so I guess what I was going to say is we last meeting, we actually passed a policy for based on the ACLU use your best practice and directed that that policy become an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that we've already given staff the direction pretty clearly. Well, and so, again, we're not approving anything. What we're asking is bring this back and tell us how any data that was collected would be used in the course of the collection of this, so that we can make an informed decision about whether or not we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want to move forward with a license plate readers. You know, if there's not a scenario where a person wants to go or wants to support license plate readers, I wouldn't move this forward. Again, I didn't. I did mark this not urgent but important with the understanding that the the city manager and the police chief are going to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have to choose their that their prioritization in terms of work plans. You know, I think, you know, how I would summarize this this referral and I'm happy to say not limited to it's basically is it are there scenarios where a majority of this council would support license plate readers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would suggest, given that there are scenarios where I will in scenarios where I won't, you know, I would be interested in looking at not sharing with national and possibly state law enforcement agencies, but possibly sharing with local law enforcement agencies, at least for consideration, and then identifying the effectiveness and concerns so that it can come back'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at some point when the when the police department decides that it is a big priority for their goals and the goals that we've given them, so that we can have that conversation knowledgeably with all the information in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going next because I feel compelled to address something that you said, Vice Mayor. I take exception to the story, the incident that I described in New York being characterized as a hyperbolic example. In fact, it is reported that there is an increase in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It since that I minutes of your time is that council would need to vote to suspend the rolls to continue additional.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can I. Whatever time. See, time. I'll be allowed to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Well, you can vote to allow me to continue or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Are there others who would.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like 3 minutes or 4 minutes or what.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do you suggest?'",
        "'speaker_0': '3 minutes would be fine for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Day three, then 3 minutes second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. I. Okay. So I don't think that that was a hyperbolic example, and it certainly wasn't a Timothy McVeigh. That's the reference to the Oklahoma City Federal Building. But Vice Mayor, it has been reported and documented that there is an increase in anti-Semitic incidents in our country just a week before the attack at the rabbi's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'home. There was an attack on a kosher grocery in New York. And so, God forbid anything should happen in our community. But we also can't put our heads in the sand and pretend that it won't. And what I'm considering are issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, if we had the police chief or someone from APD here, they would tell you that they're concerned with crimes a lot more serious than package thefts and that they have you know, we're a very safe community, but there's some folks who do some pretty horrendous things that pass through here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, yeah, at the end of the day, I think we all do want a safe community. Thank you for sitting me more time. Okay. I saw that everybody's got their hand up. I saw Councilmember Avella first. I'm going to go to her, then Councilmember Desai, then Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Vella So I just my concerns from before were that I don't want this to give people a false sense of security. And I think that that's kind of what's underscored by what the vice mayor has put forward in terms of requesting data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I, I would like I am interested in data, not allegorical stories or that sort of thing, but but hard data specific to prevention. We've we've heard a lot about how these can be helpful in solving crimes, to me, increasing public safety.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's great that we can solve crimes. I want to make sure what's the data around preventing them? And that's part of what's included in here. And I appreciate that. But and that's I just want to highlight that that's something that's of of importance to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that there's often a lot of different tools that are available. For instance, China's using facial recognition software. We see biometrics coming up more and more with AI forms of identification. Even real ID is is kind of another method of of kind of harvesting data by government is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here that right we're just talking about LPR is just for the sake of Browning correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But but my concern is while it could be a substantial tool in solving crimes when we're do it, when I'm doing the analysis of the civil liberties, I also want to see what's the trade off. And, you know, I do think we're in a time of heightened anti-Semitic attacks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, a lot of this coincided also with, you know, the celebration of Hanukkah. But we're we're alternatively seeing that, you know, there was a report out this weekend that right after the airstrike that killed the Iranian general, that customs, customs and Border Patrol detained dozens of people and that the plane was Iranians.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Iranian-Americans that. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and again, how how did they know they were Iranian-American? You know, they were detaining them at the border. Yes, it was the border crossing. And there's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They had dual citizenship, too.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. But but to me, I you know, I am worried about again, who are we sharing this data with? I frankly would be concerned with even sharing it with local law enforcement, depending on if those other cities had policies to share their information with other agencies in a time where these sorts of things are being used to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to to look at individuals of certain ethnic descent. I also think that, you know, there was a lot of discussion when we heard this item the last time around, the value and this was not our police chief, but the product, the person that was representing the product around the value of the photo showing the surroundings and the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'people in the vehicle. And I think, you know, my fear, I guess my greatest fear would be that somebody says, I have a partial license plate, I have 6l2, but the person was this race. And all of a sudden we're now scanning through, you know, looking for everybody who's X race and has, you know, one of those'",
        "'speaker_5': 'things in their license plate. And I think that's. Part of at least what I think is Councilman Otis concern. And so I think structuring around how our police officers intend to use this and, you know, whether or not, again, whether or not they're exempt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To me, I wouldn't be comfortable with a blanket law enforcement exemption to either of the policies that we discussed before. If this is something that we're looking at getting, because I think that this is a tool that that does have the potential to be abused.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Councilman Woodside.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you. We in the city had lpas and and now we don't have lpas and and. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we never had fix.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we need to have these kind of lpas as well. So if it means making trade offs, you know, then let's have this discussion and let's move forward with Vice Mayor Knox White Counsel referral. But, you know, there are some things that I'm interested in when it comes to whether there or LPR is on vehicles or whether'",
        "'speaker_7': 'there are mounted LPAS. There are some things that I'm interested in and I think the city of Alameda had already demonstrated its ability to move forward with, you know, a reasonable policy with regard to all those other important issues like data retention, like civil liberties.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we've demonstrated that already with the vehicle LPR And I see no reason why we can't use that as a basis for moving forward with the other type of LPR is that the community is interested in having, but if it means, you know, some of the items that the Vice Mayor Knox White needs to be part'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the discussion, then okay, we'll have that discussion. And if that's necessary, you know, make trade offs and compromises as I as I would as a council member because I think. That's what the residents want us to do, is to make this a safe and secure island as much as possible for everyone of all ages.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just I'll try to be brief. First of all, Mayor, I thought I'll.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Give you more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First I thought your points are very eloquent and your understanding of Lpas is completely in line with my understanding. But I don't think the public knows as much about it as you do because. You know, I was there at that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I supported the the the mobile ones, but the mobile ones are scanning and looking for stolen vehicles. And six years ago when we did that, you know, that was that was a big deal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not just stolen vehicles missing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Right. So to me, there's a difference. And I'm not saying I'm against them. I want I want all these answers. I could vote for them if my concerns were were addressed. But, you know, there's a difference between patrolling around and driving around in the city and capturing the license plate of every single person who comes on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and off the island. I mean, that's the difference for me. And you were eloquent in the point that you pointed out exactly what these things do. They help solve crimes. They help solve that crime. And no one talks about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the Oikos shooter, we found him because the Oikos shooter was found in Alameda, my understanding, because of one of our mobile helpers. So remember that which incident? The oikos over in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The he shot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He shot the people at the at the Korean school.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, I mean, there's a value in solving crimes. I totally get that. But I don't see how it prevents crimes. I mean, maybe the incidents where, you know, there's a a truck that, you know, is smashed and grabbed up the East Bay and, you know, we can ping and then we know that person is there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, that's you know, that's an instantaneous use, you know, that I don't think anyone has any issue with that type of use. The concern I have and because we did a lot of discussion on this is from, you know, when I spoke to CHP and OPD years ago when they were doing this is you have to have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a tremendous amount of data if you want to if you want to solve some of these other crimes that you have to look at. And so for it to be a really valuable tool, you have to keep a year or year and a half worth of data and we have to have a discussion on what if we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'want to if we want to do that. And B, if we do do that, what the tradeoff is. So the tradeoff is data that is at risk or that, you know, needs special controls around it. So I, I really appreciate, you know, those comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So these are the things I want to hear about. I had one other thing to say, but I forgot. But I am concerned. And if it's as you describe, which I believe it is, Mayor, you know, where you're taking a picture of a license plate and you're never going to be able to, you know, look at the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'driver. To me, that's my understanding. But I don't think the public has that understanding. I think they they think if they call in and say a green guy, you know, in a in a tan suit and, you know, just did X, Y and Z that the police are going to be scanning license plate photos for green guys'",
        "'speaker_2': 'driving a tan sedan with or, as Malia said, the six L. S license plate. And that's where I think people want us to be able to do that. And my understanding is you can't do that. And if that's true, then I'd feel more comfortable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if there's a chance that that could happen, I think there's that's where the risk of of racial profiling comes in. But, you know, I could be you know, it may not matter to me. But I was happy to support the mobile ones.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to make sure there's a differentiation. And if there is something that says it prevents crimes, I'm all ears. But, you know, I think it's effective tool solving crimes. But I have yet to see anything that says it's going to prevent crimes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I could address your points really quickly and the mobile ones I know, I love it. I should go. I'm had bet on the mobile ones. You know, the Council on American-Islamic Relations actually had issues because of it, as of an incident in New York, where police with Mobile Alpers were patrolling around a mosque and getting'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the license plates. But we don't do that. We have a policy. Our retention policy and LPR is, if I recall correctly, is six months. The police chief is still not happy with me because he would have wanted a year, but I really held out for six months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just felt that that should be long enough. And so as far as could they prevent crimes, I would submit this scenario. So the attacker on the rabbi's home in New York, he had been following these, you know, hate filled websites.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He was armed. Who knows what he might have done and where he might have gone if he hadn't been stopped. I know that our LPR as our roving ones have stopped people who are child abductors. I mean, that's preventing a crime and stop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The stabbing or the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, but but but I can't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And so anything we do is going to require some public education. I hope we'll go forward with considering the policy. I hope we'll make sure to have someone from the police department here to answer our questions or draft the staff report or something if and when it comes back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice Mayor. So, I mean, if we're ready, I'd like to propose a motion that essentially moves. I really think all this conversation and the considerations is what I tried to do. I heard a few things that I wanted to add into it just to make it clear I heard concerns about photo captures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that at the very least, we should we should request any information might may improve their standing as most of the light. Our helpers do not take photos, but I do know that there were some old models that did so a clarification that photo capture would not be a part of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I think also just based on the things I'm hearing, I think that we need clarification and as we're discussing the new data privacy policy, how that links up with our LPR policy, I would suggest the A LPR policy needs to be amended to align with our data policy in that we definitely part of the conversation'",
        "'speaker_4': 'when, if and when it comes back needs to be an express discussion on the public safety exemption and how that would apply to the data that's collected here, because it's not my expectation that we're just going to collect information and that does APD and other law enforcement agencies are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need another motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, actually, I think by 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought it was specific to the mayor, but if no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it was everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think if that were my, my motion would be essentially the referral as written with the mayor's not limited to addition clarification about no photo capture and expressly asking for clarification on the LPR policy as it correlates to the new data policy, future ordinance and express discussion on the public safety exemption and how it might play into'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this vis a vis the data policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a motion to have a second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I could second that, but I don't know if I want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go second and then the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unless you were making a friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a kind of be a friendly amendment. I'm I'm not sure we need to say no photo capture, but, you know, an analysis of what photo capture capabilities may or may not exist because, you know, maybe there maybe that'll never happen, but maybe they'll be some technology that can be an add on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's I think, you know, when I hear my colleague on the left not supporting front of capture, I'm not very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much supporting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It either. I'm not supporting I wouldn't support photo capture. I don't think if we're not using I don't know why we need photo capture for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't think we do either. But my point was, what if the the product we get somehow has an ability to do that in the future? You know, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then we amend the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Way they did. Then they would have to come back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where it's happening without us knowing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that's that's that's its own problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think my concern would be I want to I want an ordinance to deal with the technology as presented today. I want an ordinance that deals with the technology as presented in known today. And I think it's for a future for future council to amend the ordinance if they're going to expand it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think this helps prevent the situation that we had even with our last renewal of the license plate reader technology with the company that that was doing things that were in violation of our ordinance. So if we create the ordinance and there some somehow a violation, then we actually have a legal legal ground to stand on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to say, hey, no, we said no, you should have known better and you're in violation and breach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll just second it as it is then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We have a motion. We have a second. All in favor or any discussion? No discussion. All in favor. Hi. All right. Thank you for the discussion. All right. Good work, everyone. Thank you. All right, now we move on to item ten Council Communications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's just go down the list. Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Didn't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Really do that first or second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't care to do that.'"
