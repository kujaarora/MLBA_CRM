        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Again, my name is Kurt Peterson. Thank you for allowing me to address you tonight on this issue. I've been a member of the Restoration Advisory Board as a committee member for since 2000. So over 15 years, I first became a member as far as the RAB because I was always very concerned for the safety as far'",
        "'speaker_0': 'as the cleanup out at the base of a very close to it. But one of the key purposes I was always on the board is the concern that I have as far as any kind of lawsuits or extra hidden charges that might be gathered as far as from the city when they took over the base property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things I want to thank, Mayor Spencer and Congress Councilman Hardy as far as attending our last RAD meeting. Thank you very much. I know that we've changed, you know, a lot of this particular board. I just want to make sure that you are aware that there are numerous institutional controls involved with this property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would hope, though, you have other governing boards to look at it. I would hope that our attorney would look very carefully as far as to make sure that we aren't liable for any situation. It could be as simple as digging a hole for a tree in an unknown spot, especially 15 or 20 years from now'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I just want to make sure the city, as you as members of the representatives of the city, are aware of this and that it could be hidden costs. And when you look at this, you look at that very carefully.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know we have some other people that like to speak on this, too. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Susan Gallimore.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, I'm Susan Gallimore and it was Curt on the Reb. I'm on the Reb. I've served now for probably about ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this year I am the co-chair, so you might be seeing more of me. I also wanted to say that thank you, Mayor, for coming. We really appreciate it. I know Frank Matarese has been many times and we are looking forward to you being back at the Reb and Jim Odey was there recently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm basically here today to introduce you all and the rest of the audience here to the REB members, many of whom are here today. I'm not going to reintroduce Curt, but I want to recognize George Humphreys and I'm going to ask people if they could just stand up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'George. George is invaluable. He's an engineer. He helps us understand a lot of the chemical stuff. Um. Dr. Carol Goodstein is here. There she is. Burt Morgan. I don't think he's here tonight. He's been on the air for about 15 years.'",

Victor Quintel is a new but he worked on the on the base for about 30 years so he knows a lot I would say where the bodies are buried, but I'm'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not going to do that. Dale Smith, she's not here tonight. We recognize her. William Smith, I know is. And Richard Bangert and Jim Sweeney is not here tonight. So again, I want to thank and recognize these people. They have put in years and years and years and years of work and enormous amounts of reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's all very important, as Peter pointed out, that we go forward and, as could pointed out, understanding what we are going to be liable for in the future. And I also wanted to tell people here tonight that every year the Navy puts on a tour and it's open to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anybody can come. It's a bus. And they take you beyond the fence where there's a fence beyond which you may not go. And this one takes us out to all of these sites that were mentioned tonight. And please come, because there's an enormous amount of work going on there these days, a lot of contouring, a lot of'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We are busy setting it so it will be sometime in June or July. I'm going to try and make sure that the newspaper advertises that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we certainly will. I mean, the more that more people that come out there, the better. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I can share. The next meeting is March 12th. The meetings are always 630 to 930. We are posting those dates on our city's calendar. So and they are open to the public. You are all welcome to come to join us in City Hall West.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you to everyone that does serve on this. This is actually a real important part of Alameda. We all we all want that cleaned up. And I really appreciate all the service of the Navy to help us in that regard.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So I guess the speaker said I was at the red meeting on January 8th, a very interesting meeting, in-depth analysis of all the cleanup efforts out there. And one of the presentations we heard that day was on what the test results and plans for site 32, which is the Northwest Territories, out the area, out past the antiques'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fair I believe it's owned open space and the Fish and Wildlife biological opinion describes a park envisioned there for 147 acres along the Oakland estuary and that includes site 32. We're going to talk a little bit more about, you know, the community's vision for wetlands out there later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I know for the most part over the years on the council, we really haven't submitted any comments on proposed cleanup remedies or alternatives, although Dr. Russell has submitted plenty of comments on our behalf. But in this case, I think it might be a good idea if the City Council is in the loop on this one, depending'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on whether or not there are institutional controls placed on the site restricting, digging, how those restrictions are worded, or even if there are none at all, for example, that will have a bearing on the future cost and hurdles in removing all of the remnant pavement, bunkers and on buildings so a park can be developed, you know, has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'often the case. This Rabb presentation came ahead of the official release of a site to investigation, report and feasibility study, which I believe is expected in early February. And there's a comment period. I'm not sure if it's 30 or 60 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then one of the criteria in the approval process of a circular superfund remedy is community acceptance. So I'd like to talk about this in February in the Council with with the rest of council, with staff, Dr. Russell and the community, when the alternatives are clearly spelled out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So maybe we can favor one of the alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. This is a very important issue. You know, many years ago, when we started the process of redoing what was then called east housing and building what ultimately became the Bayport community. Many years ago at the time we had gone through a lot of levels of approval when it comes to cleanup.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Having not only gone through the federal process, but also having gotten signed off by the state, D.C. Department, toxic controlled substance substances, controls. And even after having gone through those different layers, you know, we still had to deal with this one item that just popped up, which was unexpected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fortunately, we had our insurer who covered the cost of it. But the lesson from from certainly Bayport and you know, it was something fortunately that we could treat, but it was you know, the lesson of that is, you know, we all we have to be vigilant and push as hard as we can because even with these layers'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we have in place and we might have to, you know, step in, though, as we did in the case of Ice House in Bayport at the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I remember comments. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. A thank you for that report, Dr. Russell, and thanks to all the members of The Wrap for their their hard work. And, Daryn, I think it was between 2006 and 2010 of when the Ora Alameda Reuse and Restoration Authority, I'm not sure I got that acronym right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was a at each meeting there was a report from the RAB via the council liaison with myself at the time, and we did provide many comments to records of decisions and also questions back to Drew, our consultant to the Navy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's extremely important not only for the the future use of these lands, but also the fact that almost half a billion dollars or a little more than half a billion dollars has been spent to date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there's still another 84, 85 million that is yet to be spent for continued cleanup. And I hope this council assigns a grab lays out so it's not an occasional visit by a council member, but someone is assigned the task of reporting back to the successor organization on what what the council might want a question direct comment'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on regarding what the Navy's plans, their records of decision and any other related. Cleanup activities, two properties certainly that we're going to inherit or that's going to remain. You know, I think that's really important to establish that as a formal formal function with reporting that at our successor agency meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in regards to that, for those of you that don't know, we do have a special meeting tomorrow night when we're going to be talking about, I think, things like that. And it's a public meeting. It's going to be here 630.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you can find the agenda online that we're going to be talking about us working together, moving forward, along with staff. And so that is something we can look for at that time. Yes. Thank you, Mary Spencer. And I just wanted to echo a thank you to all the members of the RAB Board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will make it to one of your meetings, maybe the next one, but I appreciate any of the volunteer boards and commissions that we have in this city. We're kind of one two. But you you do a lot of work and that's a really in-depth one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you for your service to the community. So I do have a question. Occasionally, I'll be asked by a member of the public How safe is it for them to go out? And sometimes in regards to the specific area where they may be working or or, you know, taking their children and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my question really is, if someone has a specific concern, who should they contact? I know they can go to the RAB meetings themselves, which are public and we discuss that. But if they aren't able to do that, what other suggestions do you have?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, you know I can I'll speak to and then have Peter if he has other but definitely. Derek Robinson with the Navy his contact information he is the Navy's point person on environmental issues at the base of you can always contact him from the Navy's perspective, but they're also welcome to contact me directly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then I can find that answer, you know, via Peter or via the Navy and try to be a conduit and try to get those answers as fast as possible. So my contact information is on the website. I'm, you know, JROTC at Alameda, CA dot gov.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Happy to answer those questions that anyone may have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for Derek Robinson, I'm just I have it on here. I can read it. The phone number 6195320951 and then his email derrick d r e k dot j dot Robinson, the number one at Navy Mail. And then so between the two of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. And I would actually strongly encourage anyone, if you have questions, reach out to these people because they they can help you track down the answers and then you can be assured.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. That's what we're here for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Is so Ms.. Ah, if you can help me understand, would the public have access now to areas that are not cleaned up to a level that is considered safe or is that somehow roped off or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, it depends on what the contamination is. I mean, Peter can speak to it more about, for instance, where there's groundwater contamination and there's there's not an issue with, you know, someone walking over that property, then there won't be any restriction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's really the long term. So in some cases it may just be the long term exposure to something. In other cases, it's being cleaned up actively. The Navy may want to, you know, create a fence to make sure no one gets into it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No one interferes with their cleanup process. So it really depends on on the issue. But I can say that we wouldn't have open any area that wouldn't be safe for people to to walk around. I mean, we the Navy is very careful about that type of liability.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are. So if it's not fenced off or doesn't say anything, then it is it is safe to to be there, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd just like to add just a little bit to that. I showed a slide that had the process that the Navy goes through to investigate and then clean up. What's not shown there is that the the initial examination looks at imminent threats, and if it finds any, it usually doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if it does, those are cleaned up immediately without waiting for the long term decision making about how to deal with the site as a whole. You may see some areas that are fenced off also because the Navy is actively working on them and there are just construction hazards, not not so much contamination.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hazards as construction hazards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those move around as their activity moves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Any other comments? We can move on to the next agenda. Item six f.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is right. Hesitation on Friday development at Alameda Point, including initial development concept.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even the mayor, council members. Jennifer, our chief operating officer, allow me to point out this is the first meeting of the new city council. We'll be discussing the development plans that have been in the works and that are ongoing at Alameda points related to site A and I'll talk a little bit about what that is exactly.'"
    ],
    "Site A Development Concept at Alameda Point.": [
        "'speaker_6': 'First, and this is the first time that the community will be able to comment publicly on the development concept that's been put forward by the proposed developer for for site a before delving into to the site a process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to give a little bit of history. Just there's a lot of context. I mean, a point and a lot of that helps understand why certain decisions were made. And so I want to go back a little bit in time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll do it quickly. I know we have a big agenda just to provide that context. Once I'm done, I'm going to try to keep my presentation to, you know, 5 minutes, maybe a little longer. And then the developer is here to to present their development concept.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm going to let them present as well. I'm really after two unsuccessful master developer processes. And when I say master developer, I mean a single developer for the entire 900 acres of property. At Alameda Point, there were two unsuccessful attempts to enter into agreements with those master developers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And after that happened, the city really kind of step back and city staff and city council, where should we go from here? What should we do? And I think the real the real focus was on let's let's not engage again with the developer right away, let the community kind of look at its plans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's go over those plans. Let's have a real engaged community process. We learn from some of our mistakes. So the city has worked closely with the community over the last two years to adopt a vision or kind of almost in some ways re adopt a vision for Alameda Point, which really focused on a mixed use, transitory development'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that limits jobs and attracts our limited housing and attracts jobs. And that really was going back to a 1996 reuse plan that hundreds of hours of community time was spent developing and really kind of in some ways skipping over all of those the developer plans and going back to that original community plan from 1996 that said we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'didn't want to just take for granted that that vision from 1996 still made sense. That's obviously a long time ago. Let's make sure that that still makes sense for today. And so we actually before we did any kind of real detailed entitlements around me to point, we actually wanted to go through a process of reaffirming the vision'",
        "'speaker_6': 'from the community reuse plan. By adopting this planning guide is what we called it. Some of the looking really closely at some of the key policies and key principles of that reuse plan going through public process with the planning board, a number of meetings at the planning board, a couple of meetings with the council talking about that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'planning guide and kind of re adopting that as is kind of the overarching, overarching vision before we entered into a much more detailed entitlement process. Then subsequent to that, we had about 30 public hearings from all of almost all of the city's boards and commissions, 19 presentations to community groups, ten community events, including a really successful bike'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tour that we did that had over 130 people there. We actually biked around, talked about the different parts of the base, really fun event was a really great way to to see I mean a point in fact email blast Facebook, Twitter numerous articles in the local newspapers that all culminated in approvals of of the detailed entitlements, including'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on February 4th, the city council approving a zoning amendment. So we went from a industrial overlay at the base which was consistent with the Navy's use of the property to a mixed use plan that broke the project into subdistricts, that contemplated mixes of uses a master infrastructure plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we weren't going to if the plan isn't to reengage a single developer to take over the whole property, we need to make sure that we have a plan for how all the infrastructure is going to fit together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What are those costs? Make sure we look at all of that in detail and adopting this master infrastructure plan. So anything, you know, sewers, storm drains, sea level rise, flood protection, all these different issues. And then an environmental impact report that study very carefully all of the environmental impacts, potential environmental impacts from the project, including traffic, historic'",
        "'speaker_6': 'impacts to cultural, historic resources, biological resource, extensive document about this tunnel that looked at all of those impacts and disclose all of those to the public before any approvals were made. And then on May 20th, the City Council approved a transportation demand management plan and on July 1st, a town center waterfront plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The zoning actually required in a couple of areas where it was around the waterfront or some of the housing areas where we knew the community was really wanting to delve into some of the details. We actually said, you know what, the zoning is not enough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You don't just get to have the zoning. You actually have to have a specific plan that gets into the real nuts and bolts and details of those areas before you can build anything there. And then. Funding from MTC, we're able to fund the waterfront town center plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in a I think in February we got additional funding to finish the other specific plan that will be coming to the council with a contract for. So then once it wasn't until we had these documents in place that the city decided to take a first step into engaging a developer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So really, instead of seeking a developer to come in and say, Hey, community, this is what we want to build, we took a different approach of saying, Well, we've gone through our process of deciding what we want. Now, is there a developer out there that wants to build that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So taking really a reverse approach to some of the past efforts and ultimately did an RFQ from developers for a smaller scale site, not for the whole cyber 68 acres instead of the full 900 acres. So an initial modest first step for a mixed use plan right at the Gateway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And ultimately, the council entered into an exclusive negotiating agreement with that developer. And this is really the kickoff of that community process, really, at tonight's meeting of let's look at the plans that the developer and that's proposing. And let's this is an initial concept.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're going to get into more detail. We're going to be back here before you every month. So we're looking at site A is 68 acres right here at the Gateway. That is the site we're talking about. We actually at the same time and I don't I know we have limited times.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't wanna go into too much detail, but I think it's important to understand, as we also did at the same time, an RFQ for a commercial only site for about 82 acres. And through that process, we we got nine responses here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We got four responses for site B and and I'll get into a little bit more about the results of the that the site B process. But the site a RFQ is for six eight acres, a mixed use site, 800 housing units, 200,000 square feet of commercial uses consistent with the zoning, the map and the town center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Plan nine Highly Qualified Responses. We had two finalists that we decided to negotiate with, negotiate a term sheet with. So instead of just selecting one based on their qualifications, we said we're going to narrow it down to the two top developers that have, we believe, have the best qualifications.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at that point, now we want to talk about the financial terms and the other terms to make sure that we're getting the best deal for the city. And so we went into that extensive process. I'm going to talk to you about the results of that, but ultimately decided to recommend two point partners as that preferred developer'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The site B process, we went through the exact same process and that process, on the other hand, through that process of negotiating these term sheets with the two commercial developers, neither of them were willing to pay any money for infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're willing to commit to any schedule for developing the property, basically willing to weren't willing to provide any commitments to the city in terms of timing or land value or infrastructure commitment. And so the the ultimate decision was to essentially postpone that until this year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We didn't recommend going forward with those those we did not believe it was in the city's best interest to enter into a development agreement with someone that wasn't willing to commit to any milestones or commit to any infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that is essentially on hold, I should say. One of the four developers on in four site B also dropped out even before we got to that point because of concerns over the market for new commercial development and I me to point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ultimately, we selected our main point partners to it with an exclusive negotiating agreement, which is a partnership of SRM, Ernst Thomson, Dorfman Partners, Madison, Marquette and Tricon Capital. Each of these kind of specialize in a different SRM. IRN specializes in commercial development, although is working on mixed use projects and essentially provides the project management piece of this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as well. Thompson Dorfman Partners is the multifamily housing. Madison Marquette, a national retail developer, and then Tricon Capital is the capital funding. They have extensive experience on large scale, mixed use infill development. Joe Ernst, the project manager, lives in Alameda, has successfully implemented high profile commercial projects in Alameda, the VFF outdoors pizza roasting facility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And one of the things we really liked about their approach was a more incremental approach that emphasizes reuse of existing buildings for commercial uses and a truly mixed use developer that has different developers that don't just focus on housing but have the retail experience, have the build to suit commercial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that were, we believed, were really best positioned to deliver a mixed use project to the city. Site, a term sheet so attached to this exclusive negotiated agreement was a term sheet of these terms that we had negotiated, in fact, with both developers before we selected the finalist.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that resulted in an agreement in this term sheet to provide about $103 million in infrastructure amenities for Alameda Point with an important focus on three things and these were. Staff's focus the entire time was on what is this project going to provide for the rest of Alameda or for for the development of jobs out there?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we focused on three things. One, transit infrastructure, parks and open space, and then utilities and amenities that create a catalyst for jobs. So transit infrastructure there in the Phase one have agreed to provide a complete gateway, gateway extension of Ralph Bizzaro Memorial Parkway into Alameda Point Point from Main Street all the way to Seaplane Lagoon'",
        "'speaker_6': ', including dedicated bus, rapid transit lanes, payment of $10 million for upfront construction of a new ferry terminal to Seaplane Lagoon. And we're going to be able to leverage these funds to actively pursue $25 million in Measure B funds and federal grants for West End transit, bike and pedestrian improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So not onsite, but offsite developer being able to leverage these commitments to be able to pursue these other funds for offsite pedestrian multi-modal improvements. Parks and open space 36 and a half million dollars, or about 33% of the total infrastructure they're planning, is going towards parks and open space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That includes an eight acre waterfront park along the northern edge of the seaplane lagoon and neighborhood park, greenway. Flood protection and geotechnical improvements related to the parks, which is it's very expensive. A first phase of development to include 5 million towards a waterfront park, an upfront payment of $5 million towards an initial phase of the sports complex'",
        "'speaker_6': ', which is a 44 acre sports complex, actually planned offsite on the northern part of the property. Catalyzing employment uses all the infrastructure amenities that help retain existing jobs and catalyze new jobs and redevelopment were prioritized. So for instance, and I know it's not very interesting, but a sewer line, it's probably one of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you ask our engineers, you know, technically, probably the number one thing that needs to get built to be able to catalyze jobs, especially for a new commercial development, which is in the southern part of the property. Because, you know, our luck is that an actual sewer pump stations on the, you know, direct opposite northern part of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the property. And so being able to create building that sewer line from the gateway all the way up to the Northern Pump Station now makes it that much more feasible for us to be able to open up that job, the new development job center in the southern part, because you don't have to build the sewer line all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the way up to the northern part. It's now built for you. You have to reach up to ramp up basato to grab it. It's a huge benefit, we believe, for not only the adaptive reuse area that it winds through, but ultimately that enterprise area in the southern part of the base.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Ramp Gateway Improvements create an attractive entry into Alameda Point. This is something we've heard. We heard from the commercial developers that we're interested in the site B, they said we need somewhere to bring the executives to tour them, to be able to help them visualize how a new campus here would make sense.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And having an attractive gateway is key to that. Parks and Phase zero plans that bring amenities, early amenities to the waterfront to create a sense of place to offer amenities for employees, we believe is crucial to that. And this project has committed through their term sheet to build that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Site a next steps detailed project planning. So this is getting into the details of the site plan, you know, starting with the city council, the city council, as it says, in the end, it will be providing guidance to all these other boards and commissions about what they think of these plans will be taking that feedback from the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city council, from all the boards and commissions, and making sure this development plan evolves over time. So respond to those comments and then culminating ultimately. So that's through tonight, really through May of 2015 and then a recommendation for to the city council in May of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What does that mean for the city council? It means we'll be here for you every single month reporting on the status of Site A and the development there, and giving you feedback on all the different refinements that are being made as this process evolves and responds to the community feedback and the city council feedback and the other'",
        "'speaker_6': 'boards and commissions. I'm happy. I'm happy to answer any questions, but it probably makes sense at this point. I turn it over to our developer. Joe Ernst is here from Endpoint Partners to briefly provide a little of his vision and then turn it over to his planner, urban planner to present their concept.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. My name is Joe Ernst and with SRM behalf of my partners, we're very happy to here tonight. Be here tonight to give you an update on the project process. You know, as Jennifer mentioned, we continue to bring a very solid team to this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a very local team. And therefore, we bring a lot of local market knowledge and expertize, relationships that I think we'll bear well on this project. We are a mixed use team. We have very strong commercial retail capabilities, which we know is a key goal of the community for the point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've heard time and again the community council members talk about transit. We're very committed to working with the council, to working with community on transit solutions and both implementing them and monitoring them, tracking them going forward to make it work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think with Alameda Point, you know, it means many things to many different people, whether you're for or against. I think many.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can agree this is a prime priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Project for the community. And as a result, you know, that played heavily in the evolution of our plan. You know, we've we've chosen to embrace the base to be a part of it, not to scrap it and start from scratch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we do have our planners here from bar architects tonight who will give you more of an overview of that. However, a few things I'd like to talk about. You know, we do remain committed to jobs and open space and being a catalyst for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, our preliminary plan you'll see tonight does have about 20% more publicly accessible open space in it than the town center price precise plan. We were able to do that because this plan, you will see, you know, does not contain 68 acres of what I'd call a traditional low density, high car use housing we do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a result, we do retain ample area for business and for open space. Our retail commercial strategy is not formulaic. And again, we continue to focus on the artisan maker movement, one that's already developing there. We've seen this time and again serve as a catalyst for urban redevelopment and job generation in other markets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The residential component clearly remains critical to, you know, the community's collective end goal, and that's namely jobs in parks. You know, in this era of post redevelopment, the residential is really the only way to generate sufficient capital to do the infrastructure to to develop the parks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we've done our residential in a way, not just to, you know, fill up the site. We've we've tailored it to leave ample space for business and parks. We've tailored it to attract a demographic that we think that we know more readily embraces transit solutions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, the infrastructure that will be undertaking with city does present a minimum scale. We believe, you know, based on our engineering study to date, to really provide some economies to do this right. You know, to do this on a site by site basis, as you know, each prospective owner would come in, would probably rate about 2'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to 3 times. You know, just quickly to wrap up, we know that, you know, from our experience what quality companies want, you know, what it takes to attract businesses, the Alameda and the East Bay, you know, these companies always tell us they want mixed use housing, they want amenities, they want transit access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They want these in close proximity without that. And we've seen this in our business parks, that Alameda business parks are often left to compete left to compete on low cost only. And as a result of that, you know, we see our business parks suffer more greatly, the ebbs and flows of strong and weak markets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And these result in lower proper, you know, value propositions that would not support the infrastructure costs at city. So, you know, we need to change the game out there and with, you know, an infrastructure and the type of project proposed for site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, these are the things that guide us. These are the things that, you know, we are thinking about as we develop this plan. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to our team to walk you through the concept.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the council staff. I am here representing a fairly broad design team. I have with me William Duncanson from our office, also April Phillips of April Phillips Design Works Landscape Design Firm. But there are many other people that have participated in this process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you see on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What's your name?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. Your name? My name? David Israel. I'm principal in charge. Would be architects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I recognize your picture.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So the parcel site A is what you see depicted on the screen here. As we started to look at this, we really started to look in at the site more closely and really try to understand what is it that would make this a place that Alameda deserves?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It should. It's a very special site. It's a very special city. It is an island. It is unique in that regard. And the site is very unique. It's got a unique history. It's got a unique sense of place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So how can we create something here that is uniquely about both Alameda and about the history and character of Alameda Point? So as we looked at that, we looked at a concept that's actually described here called palimpsest. And this is a this is the notion of reusing something, but reusing it in a way that still retains the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'character of its origins. And so what we started to look at was, as Joe said in his presentation, rather than coming in and saying there is nothing here of value, we're going to scrape the entire site and build it in a completely cohesive and uniform way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We felt it would be much better to try and take advantage of some of the natural characteristics you see on the screen here, photos of the existing some of the existing buildings that are adjacent to the site. Obviously, as you come in on ramp, this axial view to San Francisco is like something no other place can really'",
        "'speaker_3': 'enjoy. So how do we create a place that really, really resonates with this place? And how do we really reinforce some of these important axes and places where people will really be drawn to? So as we as we looked at some of the existing buildings, some of the existing buildings, while they do not necessarily qualify as historic'",
        "'speaker_3': 'landmarks, they do have a sense of context and they do have a sense of place and they have a sense of unique characteristics that you don't necessarily replicate with new buildings. So what we have done is we looked at the overall site plan and we started to look at how we might be able to integrate some of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the existing buildings and some of the existing characteristics that compromise or comprise the existing site. And how we might take a look at reusing and repurposing some of those like you have seen in some places like the French Bakery at Santa Cruz or the House of Air and the Presidio of San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These were all very humble buildings in their origins, but they all share the benefit of authenticity. They share the benefit of unique structural characteristics and the kind of buildings. And when we started to talk to Madison, Marquette, our retail development partner, started to say, these are things that really can draw commercial enterprise to buildings that are not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'formulaic. They are unique. They are the kinds of buildings that you don't readily find. So we feel that there's a real great opportunity here to integrate. And it also allows us to, again, as I say, give a sense of place much more quickly because we have some established buildings that have established character.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Another example, Granville Island in Vancouver, a fabulous place that is so crude in many ways, but so sophisticated in other ways that it's a place people just love to go to. It still has an active concrete plant on site, and yet it's a very rich tourist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually the, if I remember correctly, it's the highest tourist attraction in the whole country of Canada, which is kind of amazing. So again, examples there where they have taken some of the humble industrial buildings and really turned them into wonderful market places.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, from an economic perspective, we can offer these buildings because their existing structures, we can offer these buildings to potential commercial developers at a much more attractive point, you know, lease point, because we're not having to build brand new market rate buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we get an economic diversity, we get an architectural diversity, and we get a characteristic, a character diversity that we would not otherwise get. So then we started to look at the precise plan as it was developed and approved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we think there's a lot of really fabulous stuff in this precise plan. And as as Jennifer mentioned, there's a lot of very precise detail that sets up the character of not just what the buildings might be, but the spaces between the buildings, which are the spaces that the public really inhabits.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the character of those spaces, we absolutely plan to adhere to those characteristics that were well-studied, well conceived and will be following those characteristics. We did, though, look at some of the characteristics and in particular, we looked at the the important area where where ramp comes into the site and that and really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, before you continue. QUESTION Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the last slide, I just wanted to I had a note here. Is that the Hornet on Pier One?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the map.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On the map.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. Is that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Hornet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Aircraft? Yes, it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you guys going to move the ship?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Hornet is not part of our. You know, I don't think we have any plans specific to the Hornet that I'm aware of. Joe might be able to. But yeah, this is this actually was in the precise plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you made the precise plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there was Skip there was actually a consultant, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. So him that worked for the city directly and these were just some initial concepts of things. We might be bringing more of visitors, serving aspects of of the base closer in together, but we don't have any current plans of moving the Hornet there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We mean the city, the developer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a substantial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, no, yeah. That's I wouldn't pay. I mean we are not doing we're not we don't have plans at any point right now to do that. And in fact, there are potential plans in our lease with the Maritime Administration to maybe use that pier, generate revenue from that pier.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think this was just a little and it's outside of our plan area. I think it was just a little creative license may have gone a little too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure that that's not real. No. Okay. Thank you. That's another discussion. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. That's okay. It's complete. As as Jennifer mentioned, it's it's certainly outside the area that we've that we've looked at at all. But you're not counting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On it to attract people to that place, the Hornet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. So we really did start to look at what is the character of and we may want to flip back and forth between these two slides. And we'll look at this in a lot more detail as we as we move on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as you came down ramp, the new configured ramp Parkway, the precise plan had that as an what I'll call, for lack of a better term, an engineered roadway that went through this pedestrian node. When we really started to look at the precise plan and what we thought should really take place there, we thought the circulation that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the precise plan represents makes sense. What we thought was important, though, was when you got to that important pedestrian zone that we it becomes a much more pedestrian oriented place. So rather than it just being a street that wanders through that pedestrian location, we've reconfigured this to bring active uses, retail, residential and commercial closer to the water'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and to create a place that obviously it will be very apparent is meant for pedestrians rather than as a primary location for cars. And we'll get into that in a little bit more detail. So if you look at this precise plan or this this plan is illustrative plan, the yellow obviously represents housing the pink buildings, particularly ones'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with the E designation on them. Those are all actually existing buildings that we are intending to retain. And an important thing to note is that these large commercial buildings that are at the northern end of the project are also being contemplated to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To be retained initially. Again, going back to my earlier comment, that allows us to have flexibility to bring people into those buildings early in the project's life and and bring them on board as an on an as needed basis rather than waiting to when the market will support new construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That being said, it's still allows us to transition to new construction at any time that seems beneficial to the community. So again, when we when we did this, the idea was to follow the concepts outlined in the precise plan, but to really take a look at how could we create a place which is even more permeable and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more connected, and how we bring people from these residential areas down through this new linear park. And we'll talk about that in a little bit more detail through this kind of more industrial, historic urban park zone and to the waterfront park zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I sensing a question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I mean, I met a mayor I did have a question on the the three park designations you just listed. Can you help us?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And actually, we'll get to that in just one, one or two more slides, and then I can go through them a little bit with a little bit more clarity, I think. So then we started to just look at some of the transportation configurations that were laid out in the precise plan and again evaluated how those fit into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this plan. And again, it's a very it's a very direct mesh. And we have started discussions with with the transit district to verify route configurations and preference or bus movements. One of the things we've talked about a lot is the nature of a bus going through this important pedestrian location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're actually think we may be moving towards a solution which will bring busses. To that location, but not through that location. So we'll be sharing those as as those plans develop. But it's an exciting opportunity. The phasing then is outlined on this diagram.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So phase zero are those things that we can do right away. And again, perfect example, these phase zero are existing buildings that in the precise plan were not there. But here we're retaining those so that we can get sort of instant sense of place right away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are buildings that well, they may be humble, have great opportunity for unique revitalization and adaptive reuse. So we're excited about that opportunity. And then starting to really develop the waterfront where the where public will really be drawn to areas that they can really use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the interface between existing buildings and the water will be very important. So now let's go to the to the overall diagram of the of these park districts. And so this is basically this notion that we're developing a waterfront park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The waterfront park is intended to do two things. One, make an active, highly evolving and interactive kind of public park where people can come take advantage of and reinforce the importance of the Pan AMS historic headquarters building, which, while it isn't on our site, is directly contiguous to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so reinforcing the importance of that axes out to the water and from the water back to it, so that we can always remember that the sort of the Star Clipper was an important part of the history of this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the and that building and its its contribution to the history of this site is always kind of present in your mind. And then these buildings in the waterfront park, as we're currently envisioning those will be highly flexible buildings, which could house a number of both community and or commercial activities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, providing a lot of flexibility then that, as you can see, starts to stitch together with what we're calling our Urban Park District, which is a variety of open spaces which meander through these existing buildings, again, giving you exposure to the characteristics of that kind of historic context, and then links you to the Neighborhood Park District'",
        "'speaker_3': ', which connects you to both the commercial and to the residential neighborhoods, and allows for people to filter through those to this central link and back through the urban park and then to the Waterfront Park district as well. So this diagram sort of suggests the way that stitches together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the idea is that there's a strong sense of connectivity, an easy way for people to go through a variety of green spaces that have a variety of characteristics. And as we get into the more detailed planning of the nature of those green spaces, we'll be presenting those to you in a lot more detail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But here are some imagery of some of the ones that are sort of inspiring some of our thinking places where people can sit, places where people can get sheltered from the wind. Places where people can connect with one another and look out at the views of the city of the water and back to the other commercial activities'",
        "'speaker_3': ', places where people can gather in a variety of scales. These are some examples. I mean, we even want to take advantage of some of the existing rail lines that are there and integrate those into the landscape so that we don't just, again, strip away all the characteristics that made this place unique, but really try and build off'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of that character and really create a place that reflects that past. And then providing a variety of different green spaces and places for people to sit and respites where people can either gather in small groups, larger groups, or a very large community get get togethers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is a kind of comparison just to go back to the waterfront park. This was the the image on the right is the the image of the precise planned park. And you can see this was a street that came through and then retail was on one side of the street here and then jumped across the street'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and had retail there. Here we're showing a plaza that will be protected and still provide for movements of vehicles on the left hand side. But we have residential use that has ground floor retail consistent with the precise plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we have a variety of different commercial and retail buildings that work their way around the the Waterfront Parkway. So again, we're at the very early stages of this. We're really excited about the opportunities. We're looking forward to your input and and developing this further and really making it a particularly incredible place for Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm happy to answer any questions and I'm sure we'll be chatting quite a bit more as the process moves forward. But there's a lot of really great opportunity here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. So thank you very much. Looks like we have approximately ten speakers, just the council square. And if there's clarifying questions, we'll take that now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Um. I have some questions. I have one on the design, which I think you would certainly be. You're the person another about aspects of, you know, how aspects that might be important to the business deal that we want to get into.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So someone else might. And in terms of design. The thing that crosses my mind is the old Nancy Alameda is, in effect, a military town. It was a military town. And in that regard, you know, I remember things from City Planning School, Lewis Mumford talking about medieval cities, basically fortress cities and how there was, you know, an'",
        "'speaker_4': 'abundance usually of curving, winding roads for whatever reason. When you look at NASA Alameda, you actually see a lot of those and I think in large part to facilitate the movement of of goods through the transit. And so that's why you'll see.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also in the worst case scenario, if if certain aircraft had to be moved from one part of Alameda to another, that's why you have certain roads throughout that curve. Mm hmm. And actually, if you look at the the map of Alameda, you can kind of see the curve kind of extending perhaps to facilitate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So one of the things that I'm interested in preserving is, is that that sense of, you know, in the built environment that that that sense of what a military town was like. And so. When I look at the residential side, for example, I see it's basically linear and just something to think about is perhaps is that having'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a because I think I saw in the orange I think I see there between the buildings, I see a walkway in between the buildings. Or perhaps something to think about is to incorporate whatever extent possible. I'm kind of curving feature to add that element of surprise that that Mumford would talk about when it came to these kinds'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of medieval towns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's an interesting point. And the the townhouse this as as Joe mentioned in his introductory comments, one of the things that was very important to us was that this not come across as a completely homogenous design exercise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why we have a fairly diverse design team. So that will not be the hand of a single architect designing every one of these sites. So these are conceptual sites to test block sizes and potential densities and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're not really intended at this point to be resolved designs. Now, that being said, we have tried to respect the amount of input that went into the precise plan. And the precise plan was fairly precise about bringing the urban grid that exists through Greater Alameda and the rest of the base through this zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think it's something we'd be happy to chat about, but that is something that was heavily debated. And I think the notion of that urban grid retain. Now, one of the things we thought was important, you know, as you enter the base and you see that jet on the greenway, we really wanted to make sure we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'could kind of keep that vestigial piece. So you can see we kind of kept the curve around one side of that so that we could keep that that sort of reminder that that origin. But I will say the only other place where the site gets fairly organic is through some of the existing buildings where again, the pathways'",
        "'speaker_3': 'through there are much more meandering. And that's not to say the character of the landscape won't have a great deal of of organic characteristic to its design.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is I'm sorry, I just want to make sure we're sticking to clarifying questions right now. So it sounds like your question may very well have been, are you going to protect the circle? And I want to follow up with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are two circles. That sounds like you're not that that you will be taking out half of one of the circles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The yes, we we are that's what's proposed at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to as it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Was in the precise plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to summarize my clarifying question, if it if we are to propose it in terms of clarifying questions, I think the question would be posed as, you know, to what extent, you know, can we have these kind of narrow pedestrian paths that are kind of that you would find in in so-called medieval fortress towns, especially as it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'relates to, you know, the path that I'm seeing right there? Is it I think it could add a level of mystery and what's at the end of the of that path, whereas the linear line is okay, you can see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A completely agree with your sentiment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, and one less thing. I also recognize, you know, the desire to continue the grid design. So that's no doubt that that's going to happen, especially along the major arterials. I'm just talking about kind of like cute little paths that perhaps are only for the residents, but nonetheless make it a special place like the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do we have any other clarifying questions right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So maybe this is for Jennifer. Thanks for the presentation, by the way. So you mentioned that you're going to be reporting back to the council February, March, April and May. So the first question is, can you kind of give us a high level outline of what you're going to be reporting back to us on those four'",
        "'speaker_0': 'meetings? And what other opportunities will the public have to provide input to the plan, input at the developers, interact with the developers and comment on the plan?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, sure. Absolutely. So obviously tonight's meeting is a kickoff. The initial concept in February for the council will be coming back with a more complete we're going to kind of take the comments we get from city council. We're going to the planning board on Monday night 26, take those comments, start to prepare more formal development plan application'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So an actual application entitlement package. So we'd be coming back in February to give you kind of to provide an update on that application. More detail is going to be a lot more detail on this that's going to start to get fleshed out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be February. March is going to you know, as we go through that process, what we found when we did the entitlement process point is there starts to you start to distill down to a couple of key issues and things that people are grappling with and then have questions about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I imagine in March, by then we're going to have kind of distilled down, figured out what those are, start to hone in on those, make sure we bring those to the council, get some feedback, high level policy feedback from the council to start to hone in on how we tweak those, how we deal with those'",
        "'speaker_6': '. April would essentially be the last, the according to schedule, the last chance before the planning board hears a recommendation for the council to again weigh in on some of those key issues. The package by then is going to be complete in terms of development plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just being able a chance to see that complete package one time before the plan, it goes to the planning board for recommendation and then ultimately to the Council in May in terms of other opportunities will be going to the planning board once a month as well providing workshops for up to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there's a schedule actually attached to the staff report too for the community, for anyone who's interested. We have a web page now that we've created just related to site so people can find out when the latest meetings are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have an email list that we send out and notify every time before we have a meeting so people can sign up on that Facebook Twitter page so we can make sure to keep people involved. But we'll be going to the Historic Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There'll be a joint planning or Transportation Commission meeting in February, Park and Rec Commission in February. So all, you know, real extensive outreach. And then we have three open houses where, you know, if you if people are kind of intimidated or don't want to engage in this more formal planning process, we'll have three very low key open'",
        "'speaker_6': 'houses where the developer will have an opportunity to have the renderings. The latest pictures from the concept plan available. I will be there, staff will be available. People can just drop in from 6 to 8, ask questions of the developer, developer team, ask questions for me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those would be the first one is going to be at Callahan piano and building 14 out at the base right on the waterfront. So people can kind of as they're looking at these renderings, think about the actual space that we're talking about and look at it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then the second would be the library. And then the third with our concept right now it's still in development is actually have a walking tour. So to start at Main Street and Ralph Bazardo and then stop along the way at key locations along between Main Street and the Seaplane Lagoon so we can stop at a couple of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'key locations, actually show renderings of some of the ideas of what that space that you're standing on right here is going to look like. And then and that would be on a Saturday, Saturday morning and then end with a barbecue that allow people to actually be on the taxiways, have a barbecue, talk to the developers, talk to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'me, and just be at the space that we're talking about, because I think it's really important that I'll make point. I think we found this at the bike tour that it's you know, it's one thing to talk about and look at on an aerial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's just so daunting and huge. But when you actually are there experiencing some of those spaces, I think it's really powerful and it helps people put in context what we're talking about because looking at these drawings, not everyone responds to these drawings and you need to see it and feel it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's what we're trying to provide those opportunities for. And that schedule, like I said, we'll probably attach that schedule, you know, in case some of the dates tweak or change these things always tweaking change. We'll have that attached to every council report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So everyone's going to know how to find out what the latest meetings are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Remember Data and this is a question perhaps for chief operating officer on art in general, but do we have a sense as to the division between owner occupied and ran Iraqi pride units at this point? And I raise that because, you know, Alameda overall we have a we have a 47% homeownership rate and a 53% renter ship'",
        "'speaker_4': 'rate. And in the west end of town, it's a 30% homeownership rate and a 70% renter ship rate. And these are items that certainly affect the business deal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, yeah, we don't have an we don't have a specific break. Yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, in thinking of integrating this with jobs and companies. And, you know, we heard tonight one of the companies there who wants to bring 300 employees, renters. You know, we are looking at a project that would be unique to what we've been building over the last several years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And looking at a predominantly rental project, you know, about 75% of our project, including the Affordable, would be rental. 25% ownership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a follow up question in regards to that. So it was my understanding that 25% of this project would be affordable below market rate housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that is going to be apartments. Is that what you're looking at for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It'll be a combination. It will be some of it will be apartments, multiple in multifamily. Some of it will be part of our townhome units. So it'll be a combination.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then do you have. Okay. So I know that's 25%. Is it possible to have that percentage be higher?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, please, is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It possible to have that percentage be higher of the overall housing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it possible to. Oh, no. I mean, we'd have to look at other funding opportunities that might be available, other mechanisms. You know, we have a an affordable housing developer on our team. So we can certainly sit down with them and understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But, you know, those there's very precise funding mechanisms for those. And so, you know, we need to kind of fit within those rules, but we can report back to you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do you have any numbers in regards to what you plan, whomever is going to be charging rent or the purchase price of the units? Do you have any ranges to present us with at this point?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not at this point, no.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the future, do you anticipate that you'll be sharing that with us before making a decision on this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, it's all going to be very market based so we can share our market studies, you know, as they continue to develop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when you're so when you're looking at this, what I'm hearing is that you're looking for new housing to accommodate employees coming to work at the point as opposed to housing for people that are already here in Alameda, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're we're looking I mean, we're looking at a true mixed use project. We're looking at this does present opportunities for people who do already live and work here in Alameda? I think at the in a hearing, we heard from one renter who works at VF Outdoor and we'll hear from more of those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that, you know, existing companies, employees want to live here and can't find rental housing. So we're we're targeting those as well as. Providing housing for companies who will want to locate at the base. And, you know, from my.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the many years working in commercial, you know, we hear time and again that companies want, you know, amenities, housing in very close proximity to their place of work. Those are the kind of things that attract, you know, quality jobs, dense jobs, meaning many jobs as opposed to the more traditional, you know, low density, big box logistics'",
        "'speaker_0': 'types.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you. And I have another follow up question in regards to staff. You had mentioned that part of this proposal is $5 million towards the first phase of the sports complex. What is the total amount of the anticipated cost of the sports complex?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we have the master infrastructure plan now is about $20 million. So this would be about a quarter of what we what we set aside.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you very much. And I believe we have one more question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, more and more of a comment. I for one, I think the data when it comes to friendship in Alameda, I think the data indicates that we have a lot more rental units generally. And in the West End in particular, I think from the West End's point of view, there's been a long held desire for more owner'",
        "'speaker_4': 'occupied units. Now, that doesn't mean that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's just we're going to be able to discuss later. We just want to have our clarifying questions and then I want to get to our speakers. Any other clarifying questions? It's clarifying. Thanks. So thank you, Ms.. And and the other presenters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great presentations and the staff report I'm talking about web pages is three. But anyway it says that the planning board. With direction from the city council will approve a development plan after numerous public meetings. Thorough vetting by the community and I and forgive me if I miss this you've said it before, but how does the the city'",
        "'speaker_2': 'council give the planning board direction regarding the development plan? Does it go to the planning boards, city council, back to planning board or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So for instance, tonight during the comments, we'd like to hear City Council's initial thoughts about the site plan. Then when, you know, because of the tight timeline and the desire to keep this, you know, moving and moving forward, we will then either city planner Andrew Thomas or I will actually, since I was here tonight, I will'",
        "'speaker_6': 'actually present that those comments that you have to the planning board orally. If we have time, we'll actually incorporate those comments into the staff report, going to the planning board. So we will incorporate that into our presentation and the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just like I stood up here tonight, I'll give a similar presentation on Monday night and then append to that essentially. And here are some of the comments that the City Council had in terms of guidance toward regarding that development plan, so that the planning board can hear that, take that into consideration, and then have them react'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So we see this essentially as the kickoff. City Council Planning Board. City Council Planning Board. City Council Planning Board. Throughout this entire process, ultimately the planning board approves that development plan in April incorporating or you know, recommends approves it, the planning board or the dwelling plan and recommends any other documents to city council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the city council approves the DDA in May or the disposition development agreement. And nothing happens without that disposition development agreement. So the buck really stops at the city council. The city council has all of the all the power in terms of determining what the deal is, what the financial terms are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that DDA is really what kind of holds the keys to being able to move forward with this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for one last clarifying question. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With regard to the housing, can you explain if there's a density bonus application that is relevant to this project? Or is the project the 800 homes?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The project. The 800 homes? Correct. And the city council, essentially through its development agreement, disposition development agreement can it's the city council's land, I mean, or the city's land. And so the city council can essentially create a cap on the 800 units for this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, there may be the need for density. There most likely will be a need for a density bonus application in order to receive a waiver of the multi-family housing prohibition in the municipal code. But no density bonus units are contemplated on top of that 800 800.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's very critical with the timeline that we resolve the issues that were brought up at the last meeting. We are on what ordinance says that needs to happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that we are very aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll be discussing that. I think our.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Target is for March 3rd to come to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other clarifying questions? All right. And we're going to get to my first speaker will be Kari Thompson, then Angela Hawk about and then Ken Peterson. Thank you for being so patient.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. City Council staff. Some of you I saw this morning so I could see you again tonight. My name is Kerry Thompson. I am the immediate past president of the Chamber of Commerce. I am also the current chairperson for the Economic Development, Government Relations and Economic Development Committee for the Chamber.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And hopefully at some point in the next couple of months, I will have each of you at one of our meetings so that you can talk with our committee. I would really appreciate that. First of all, I want to thank the staff for all of their time, all of their energy, hard work and dedication to our city'",
        "'speaker_1': '. They have been extremely forthcoming with information. They have been very responsive to questions about all of the projects that are currently happening in the city. And I want to recognize them for that and thank them. And especially in regards to site, which is the cornerstone of the development for Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Creating a residential community at site A is a critical means to the desired end at Alameda Point. The economics created by housing are the only feasible way to finance parks, amenities and infrastructure in a post redevelopment era. Approximately 75% of the housing at site will be rental.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A significant departure from other new developments in alameda. With the island's housing shortage. There is particularly high demand for rental units, mixed use. Communities with the significant arts maker and entrepreneurial cultural are a proven catalyst for successful development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This environment attracts foremost companies that build a more durable and sustainable job, such as right speed that we were at this morning. Site A will create several thousand construction and permanent jobs combined. And I would just like to address Councilmember Desai and point out that we're talking about Alameda as a whole, not just as a West End'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I have grown up all over Alameda. I don't just because I currently live on Bay Farm Island identify myself as somebody from Bay Farm Island. And I really think that housing in general, particularly the rental market, is you're going to hear a little bit later is critically important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't think it matters so much as where it is, but that it's available. So I just want to share that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have a difference of agreement opinions here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next speaker, Angela. I'm sorry, Ken. You're after Angela. Let Angela speak first. Thank you. Sorry. That's okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Madam Speaker, and city council members and staff. As a renter at the Alameda Renters Coalition, we are very excited at the prospect of hundreds of rental units coming on the market in the coming years. We cannot say enough about how few units are on the market right now, not just rental, but available for sale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's nine units or houses that are available for sale. So we're not just talking about renters who will benefit from these houses and rental units. We're talking about people who aren't even able, even with money and resources, to buy a house in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So these houses, these rental units are vitally important. And in a legal environment where we have no recourse over high rent increases, they represent hope for us in that we could stay in Alameda if more of these units are built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate your consideration in studying these these plans. And hopefully, you know, in five years, maybe one of us will be living in one. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Comments earlier reminded me of some of the traditional arguments that are put forth in these kinds of situations. I reminded of the forums that we had or put on by Ms.. Ott very capably when we were looking at some of the Sun Kil ideas and in the brochure, which is a beautiful brochure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ashcraft was participating in some of those because I remember we were at the same table and there were pictures of examples of what infrastructure and amenities can be built. With the use of housing development money and that how housing development money was necessary in order for us to have those things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'None of the examples were built with housing development money. None of them. They were all built by other means. Now, I think that if you look at this structure and think of it maybe in a different way, there is an approach that might to deal with the questions of of financing, of building the infrastructure, of environment, of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'transportation and probably another other many other things, a commercial development, possibly raising money for the city, but nobody talks about it. The interesting thing is it has to do with energy and is possible to store energy very in it, very efficiently and economically and I think very profitably as well as being environmentally desirable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you have energy and energy is cheap, which I believe is possible now, you could have the possibility of supplementing the commercial establishments and the industrial interests places and maybe make this area more inviting. It can also be used to supplement the retail outlets and the housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now if you have the energy and it's cheap enough, you could possibly set up a desalination plant up in the west end of the island, and that's desirable from the standpoint of the East Bay mode, which needs the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in the process of doing that, they would probably contribute the sewage infrastructure and the supply of electricity and other things in there. The the. The State is very interested in energy storage and mandated in 2010 that the consumer owned utilities establish feasibility studies for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that some of that has been done, but done very poorly. So there's a possibility here that very exciting to take care of all of the issues except the traditional mixed use retail housing approach that you take.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Michael McDonough. Then it'll be Brian Groves and then Casey Sparks. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It evening, Madame Mayor and council staff. Thanks for having us here tonight. I just want to say that the chamber I'm the Michael McDonald, president of the Chamber of Commerce. And I want to say that the Chamber fully supports this project as well as the developer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You may know that it's been said earlier today that Mr. EARNEST is very is not only a resident here in town, but been very active in producing previous projects that have created hundreds of jobs. And of course, the chamber's interested in jobs, and we're interested in building commercial facilities out on the base as well, like most people'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are. But it's been proven that through other rescues that the commercial developers do not want to develop Alameda Point because of the infrastructure issues. So I believe that though there may be other ways to to do that, this is the only way that anyone has come up with that has volunteered to come to Alameda to develop our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'infrastructure. And one thing that bothers me even more is not only attracting those commercial businesses, but keeping the businesses that are already out there because of the deteriorating infrastructure. We've got a lot of great businesses out there that Alameda is enjoy, like Rockwall Winery, Blaydon Sports Club.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's 7000 people a day that go to play them. And just a couple of weeks ago, they lost electricity for three days. There's water main break. It's oh, I don't know, several that I've heard about that can take $50,000 a day to repair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are issues that if we can't get that repaired, we risk losing the businesses that are already out there and the jobs that they provide. So not only are we concerned about bringing more commercial businesses to the point, but keeping the ones that are there through improving that infrastructure and giving them a reason to stay there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we do not do that, I would imagine ten years from now that the base will be more vacant than it is now and more rundown than it is now, because there won't be the infrastructure to support the businesses that are there currently, much less bringing new businesses out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the chamber is fully behind this project and the developer, and we just want to do what we can to support that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Brian GROSS.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. And good evening. And you were very close. My name is Brian Graves, and I come before you tonight to read a letter on behalf of Brad Schuck, co-owner of Palladium. It reads as follows. Dear Mayor Spencer, Alameda City Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm the co-owner operator of Palladium, Sports and Fitness Club at Alameda Point. We moved our business from San Francisco to Alameda over 15 years ago, and I've grown to one of the largest employers at Alameda Point and one of the leading on the island.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our facility hosts thousands of visitors each week and employs over 120 people. We've been proud to operate at Alameda Point and can only continue to do so if significant upgrades come to this part of the island. Saturday promises to be a catalyst for redeveloping the point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are excited to hear this evening's update the council and see this plan move forward. The proposal for Friday will provide much of much of the infrastructure element a point businesses need to operate. We cannot continue to serve our clients with aging roads and failing internet, phone and other utilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Say is the minimum needed to provide some economies of scale for the infrastructure development. A bootstrap side by side approach would cost 2 to 3 times as much. Exclamation point. Alameda Point businesses have seen many failed attempts to develop the point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are encouraged by the city's vision and Alameda Point Partners plan to create a mixed use community that will attract quality companies to build a durable and sustainable jobs. Site promises well-integrated retail and open space amenities, housing and transit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will attract more companies like Wright Speed. Who's workforce want wants to work where they can live and play alamy the point businesses want to continue to thrive and grow at this location. We support this plan and will work hard to ensure success.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anything less will force us to look at other alternative locations. Sincerely, Brad Schuck, President Blame Sports and Fitness Club. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Casey Sparks. And I'm going to just read the names of the next speakers Ellen Source, Karen Bay and then William Smith. And you can just follow each other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It even.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Madam Chair, Mr. Vice Mayor and members of the City Council and City Staff. Thank you for having me speak very briefly. I don't want to repeat the points that have been made earlier, but just briefly, as a way of introduction, I'm not representing any organization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've been to be a member of the City of Element, a Democratic club, and young Democrats as a board member of each but of the denominator for two years. I'm a millennial, and I think that what is one of the main things that I'm excited about in support of Elemental Point Partners Inside is that I think that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this really plans for the future and it's progress for the city of Alameda, for our island, not just for the sake of progress, but because I think it's a major improvement for all the reasons that have been stated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that the way that it's been designed for the future is that it takes into account additional housing. So that I think what many people have spoken, their ideal vision for the future is where people can walk to work and take public transit to work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if you create additional housing on the island in addition to jobs, then people aren't coming from off the island to work here. And conversely, people aren't having to commute off the island from here to work elsewhere, which is another very on paper, simple solution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think that as element moves forward into the 21st century, we have to embrace that. We have to embrace that. People are competing differently now. They're not driving everywhere. They are taking transit more. I take the ferry and the bus and go for my work and I think that this is something that being built for the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'future, being built as a measure of progress that improves across the board the circumstances that are there now, I think that it deserves deserves our full support. And I wanted to offer that as my thought. And I appreciate your time and your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. You've heard bits of history tonight about now made a point. And I just want to give you a slightly different history that pre-dates the ones we've heard in 1993. Mayor Pizarro convened a group of chairs of commissions and citizens at large, and this was to really look at what had happened when the base closed and how'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we could restore the vitality of the Naval Air Station. The result of our 45 to 50 meetings of almost five years of work was to produce the community reuse plan that reflected what we had heard in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we had heard from the development community and experts in land use of what we might be able to expect here in our island community. The Community Business Use Plan, which I'm sure most of you have read, was to guide and did guide the changes to the city's general plan for incorporating this one third of the island'",
        "'speaker_1': 'back into the city. Our initials Brag stood for Base Reuse Advisory Group, and we added the tagline of Brag if you live in Alameda because we were quite proud of the potential that Alameda Point offers to the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we fast forward to 2014 and I think the city has said exactly the right thing by not taking on a developer to do the development, by breaking and into chunks that are more manageable and more likely to move forward in tandem than one after the other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll also offer choices in architecture that will benefit from. And this first development of the Alameda Point site really reflects sea objectives of the rig, is we channel the development ideas that the community told us into the reuse plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I really wanted to say that this first development really includes the elements that we wanted, which were a mixture of uses housing for all incomes and produces uses that will help bring back the badly needed vitality that the city lost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This also will have the huge benefit of starting the infrastructure development, which is currently a real detriment to the city and has the potential of being a sinkhole of money. If we don't find someone, that will make a big start to trigger the development out there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the Alameda Home Team urges your support for this development, and we feel that it will provide many economic and social benefits to the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Karen Bay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It had been Mayor Spencer, members of the council and staff. My name is Karen Bay. I am a 37 plus year member of the community and I'm here tonight to support the development of site A at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me, if my voice is a little scratchy, I'm getting over the flu. So first thing I wanted to mention is I don't know if you read the article in the San Francisco Business Times, one of the most.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Prestigious.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Business journals in the Bay Area. And we were on the front page and I'll read the heading. Tesla co-founder Ian Wright opens Alameda Plant to make electric truck powertrains. And I. I read the San Francisco Business Times almost daily and I can't tell you how proud I am to see Alameda on the front page competing in the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'marketplace for jobs and moving companies, relocating companies to Alameda. It's pretty amazing. And we've been on the front page, I think, in the last couple of months. We've been there at least three times. So Alameda is making a great name for itself and this project is helping us do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This we are in the middle of a perfect storm. We've got an improving economy. We've got a great location. We've got a dream team. And I've been in the real estate development business for 15 years. I can tell you this is a dream team and we're very fortunate that we are our own master developer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We get to decide, we get to choose and this is a great project. I want to focus on a couple of other really strong strengths. The construction of infrastructure, backbone infrastructure at Site A is going to lay the groundwork to lay the foundation for site B, and that is going to bring in sewer, storm drain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Streetlights, roads.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of the utilities. And it's going to be an a great gateway, by the way. I'm really into gateways. So and I've been looking at this gateway. It's really great. 75% of the residential units are going to be rental and 25% of those are going to be affordable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That speaks volumes to our affordable housing crisis that we're suffering from right now. And we're going to hear from renters tonight. This addresses that issue. And it provides amenities, housing and amenities for businesses that want to relocate and then the ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'll talk about that next time. But I'm a ten year old ferry terminal writer. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. At this point, I have three more slips on this item. William Smith next. That'll be Kurt Petersen and then Barbara Rasmussen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Council members and staff. I'm William Smith, the vice president of Renewed Hope Housing Advocates. And as Helen has mentioned, the planning element of points been going on for a while and renewed hope was founded over 15 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we were our major reason was to help get housing out of the Naval Air Station. So we're delighted to see that we've got a valid proposal that looks like it's going to go forward. So we're definitely very supportive of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of our first things that we did when we formed as a rent hopping organization was we tried to protect and get East housing converted into affordable housing. Back at that time. We didn't succeed there. There's a nice development there now, but it didn't have nearly the amount of affordable housing we thought we'd get in affordable housing'",
        "'speaker_3': '. The rest of the base within a few years. Well, few years has turned into a decade now or something like that. So we think it's time for this housing to go to go forward. And a couple other points I wanted to make in terms of your point where there are 25% affordable housing, is is a maximum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, it's not. It's a minimum. So the city could definitely go higher than that and a percentage out there. But we need to do some things about it to be very creative and very innovative. It's not going to be easy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the things we need to do is really get a bang up transportation plan, because if we get people have that, we need to get more qualify for more very, very competitive, affordable housing grants. For that, we need to have a really world class transportation plan out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also need to have business, businesses, retail and shopping where people can get close to the work. We need to have schools, so there's a lot of things we have to work together. And books is delighted that we feel the sense that the business community, the environmental community and the affordable housing community and other communities in Alameda'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are coming together, the realtors, to to get behind this project and to finally get something started out there at Alameda Point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I promise this be the last time tonight I get in. Kurt Petersen, thank you again for allowing me to address you on this topic as well. One of the things that really kind of concerns me on this whole project, and it did at the very moment that the city council approved as far as Alameda Point Partners, as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the exclusive developer for it was one of the claimed pains for the developing portion of this tax credit as far as we're Emeryville. Okay. At the Powell Street, I-80 area. Okay. I don't know if most of you probably gone there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I noticed right off the bat, congestion and traffic is an outrageous problem in Emeryville. So again, it falls under the concern that I have as far as development and making sure that traffic is set up properly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, I want to mention real quickly up here, if you're going to show us some illustrations like this, you need to get the jet in the correct area because that's not where it's at. It's definitely south of there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you're going to give us the illusion that that's the straight view in from our Basato Parkway, that is not because it runs south of where the seaplane lagoon is. So if they're going to present something to you, it should be accurate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The other situation. They mentioned several things, and I'll try to do it real quickly. The Dredging Seaplane Lagoon. Okay. Since when I first joined the RAB, one of the things that got postponed time and time again was the clean up the seaplane lagoon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It wasn't until the last three years they said, Gosh, we don't know what to do with this horrible site. Then three years ago, the Navy said, Oh, we'll simply dredge it. It'll take care of everything. Okay. Well, you have radioactive material that's come down in both corners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. They did do dredging. They're still implying that there still could be some radioactive materials in the water, especially in the corners. They're talking about dredging it, which could interrupt and disturb that material. ST $10 million. That's great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got to look at it more carefully. Could be a lot more than that. We're talking millions that the Navy has used to clean up. This is what I was talking about. Open up a can of worms that can come back and bite us all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we want to do that. We want a beautiful place out there. Not an outrageous expense for myself and the rest of the city. Alameda. The other thing is I couldn't help but also notice these beautiful little islands that are down over on the sea plain lagoon side.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's also area that they found some radioactive material in that park section. So, again, I don't know what they slated as far as clean up of that could be a lot more than they are aware of. And also, I thought it was going to be a lot more as far as industrial or commercial, lot less housing, tons'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of housing, housing costs, money, as everybody knows, inner structure wise. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So next to be Barbara and then John Spangler. And then I think we're finished with our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Members of the Council. Staff. Happy New Year. Looking at this, I did not intend to speak. But in looking at this, we have a maximum of 800 units currently in this phase plan for housing. My question is, where are these children going to go to school?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sure there are going to be some children there. Do we have a plan in any of this for where they're going to go to school?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. John Spangler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, mayor spencer. By Syrian Motor City members of the council and staff. I've been to a lot of meetings, that element of point since Lynn and I moved here in 1997. I'm really pleased with the Alameda Point Partners proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Overall, obviously, not all the details are in yet. We don't have as got some everyday sug mentioned housing prices and a lot of other things and finding schools is important too. But I like the direction of this. I like the re-use of existing buildings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I like the fact that the housing will be compacted so that it will be more transit friendly. And as Bill Smith mentioned a few minutes ago, transportation is the key and element of point. And we can make it work with the connections we have on and off island.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will have to change our habits, but that's not impossible. We have all learned to not smoke in as many places as we used to drive smaller cars than my parents drove. And otherwise do things differently and we can continue to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I hope this proposal will keep moving forward. And we're going to see some more good news at the next update. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Right. And we're comments. Matt Amir. Yes. Good to hear. For some clarification for a couple of I think major points that were raised on the I know is Mr. Russell still here? Not the missile is not capable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But can you can you talk to the sea plane, lagoon dredging issue?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As to the the Navy has they did performed quite a bit of dredging in those two corners that you saw in the presentation before. And significant cubic yards of sediment was removed. It was actually spread out on these drying beds, dried, scanned for for radioactive material and then disposed of appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the Navy has clean up those two corners, which were the concentrations of the contamination. And, you know, as I think Peter Russell said earlier, that indications are they haven't you know, the the bow isn't on this yet and not everyone's signed off entirely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that that those areas are have been sufficiently cleaned up to the standards that were were expected. Um, as we move forward, there are these kind of light fixtures and other things that, that they found that are sparsely about for per acre, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And not so much light fixtures, but light switches like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which is that had residual luminescent paint on them. And so those as we move forward, the institutional control most likely for site 17, which is a Sea Plan Lagoon and this is all still being worked out to a certain degree will be will say that the dredging has to have a sediment management plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just like we have for the rest of the site, here's how we're going to dispose of the sediment because of these like these little devices or kind of light switches. And so that sediment management plan will contemplate essentially the same process we believe that the Navy did, which is dry the sediment, scan it, and then dispose'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the spoils appropriately. And so, for instance, when we're looking at the ferry terminal, we will have to we don't we are hopeful. And we've actually had a marine engineer look at the the topography and our what you say the bathymetry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's called of the Sea Plane Lagoon. We did a scan recently in October that found that most likely with this ferry terminal, we won't have to do any dredging. But if we do do some dredging, we will have to go through this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It'll probably be very minimal and we'll have to go through the same process that the Navy did in terms of disposing of that sediment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then when other question or did you ask a question on this topic? Because I was going to hop to another topic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just had a note. Ever brought a comment. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And if you can, I know this is beyond the scope of CIDA, but I also know that there is some school district property out in Alameda Point. But can you speak to the question that was raised to where do the children go to square with children who live there, go to school?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. So there are a couple of things. I mean, we will we have been and will continue to be in dialog with the school district as we go through these open houses, will be doing stakeholder meetings and the school district will be one of the stakeholder holders that we will meet with to discuss this plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've been doing that for the last 24, 24 months, going through the entitlement period, met a number of occasions with the school district staff. We will also the developer will be required to pay capital fees for to the state as part of their project to fund construction of new schools.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This there is a 20 acre site that's currently owned by the school district that could be the site of a new school if the school district decided to pursue that. And we have looked at our environmental impact report at impacts to schools and the availability in the different schools around Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, whether or not there's room at Ruby Bridges or we'll be looking at that and working with the school district to discuss that and address that issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So at this point, members can make comments of actually, did you want to make comments or you on here for me to do but I'll I'd love to hear from my colleagues thank you. Okay. So you can go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember in your presentation. Thank you. By the way, was excellent presentation. You mentioned that there was a team that was completed and then I heard one or two comments from the public that were putting the cart before the horse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can you explain to me, are we doing that? And if we're not, then maybe you can explain to the public. So they have the benefit of of your knowledge on why we're not sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. I do not think we're putting the cart before the horse. I think we before any develop or similar to the zoning to the master infrastructure plan, we decided we didn't want each developer to come in and propose their own team plan, although we do have something that I'll discuss.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But what we wanted was a team plan that looked at the entire base. So Transportation Department manager plan was all that means is how do we make sure, how do we get people out of their cars, out of there and onto transit and using other modes of transportation, incentivizing people to walk to work, other things like bike'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to work, take transit to work. How do you do that? What's the way to address that? And this plan does that. It looks at all of Alameda point. It's very detailed. It actually has a cost to the budget related to all the different programs and incentive incentive programs, transit programs that that are contemplated for Alameda point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it actually requires every developer that comes in including the city developer and they're working on theirs right now I know because I've talked to them about it is a transportation demand management compliant strategy. So every developer so come in and tell us how they're going to comply with our overarching team plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that doesn't just mean check a box here or there, it means telling us in very detail how how are they going to fund some of these things? How are we going to address these issues, what programs are going to get implemented and when?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And those programs, just to be clear, are our shuttles. I could be trained, it could be transit with AC transit. But if AC transit, you know, there are some comments made. I've seen, you know, if AC transit doesn't step up to the plate, then private shuttles are going to be there to provide the service.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's going to be direct, fast, convenient service from Alameda Point to 12th Street, BART, within the first 100 units, if not sooner of development out there. So that's part of it. Free bus passes for all employees and all residents at Alameda Point and car share, bike share facilities, all kinds of programs, van pool, ride sharing programs, all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'kinds of other programs. We have, in fact, have a grant from MTC $150,000 grant for over three years to hire some of the best transportation consultants that specialize in setting these programs up. It's actually the woman that set up the emery go round in Emeryville, which is extremely successful.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She'll be working as a contractor for us, paid for by MTC to help us implement this plan over the next three years. Holding our hands, holding developers hand, making sure that every development has a good plan for addressing these issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it does it successfully and in a way that was going to, you know, make sure that people use transit. Another approach, honestly, and it was it was interesting to hear one of the speakers that said their millennium is to attract the right type of people to the site not and to make sure that that the development'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is created in a way that attracts the type of people that don't use cars or you only have one car. And so that's an important part of this. And one of the ways you do that is having convenient transit shuttles, other services there from the moment they move in, sort of wait four or five years and then'",
        "'speaker_6': 'implement some of these programs. Well, then you've already sold homes or you already rented homes to people that obviously don't use transit because they bought a home here where there wasn't any. And so the important piece of this is creating those day one strategies or having fast, convenient service shuttle programs, bus pass, free bus passes from day'",
        "'speaker_6': 'one. And every property owner is going to have to pay into that to fund operations so that you have a dedicated funding source for paying for those things, so that if someone if they say, hey, I'm not going to pay this special tax to to pay for transportation, I'd like to drive I'm not going to pay for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that if I'm not going to use those services. So the intent is to really attract people that really want to live in a community that uses transit. And what we've heard from some of the consultants that we talked to, transportation consultants, there are very few jurisdictions around here that are actually requiring developers to pay for operations of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'transportation. It's one thing that they do, you know, infrastructure districts, CFDs, to pay for infrastructure or municipal services, police and fire, but actually require developers to pay for operations. The transportation services is actually very cutting edge. It's not being done in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not being done in Berkeley. So we're we've got a lot of really great, very detailed plans. And I'm going to point to plan. And every developer, including this one, is going to have to tell us how they're complying with that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that will be part of the package that comes to the planning board, comes to the council, and will ultimately have to be approved by this council. So it's going to have to stand up to it, to your standards as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comments from council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Mayor of a couple of comments. Um, first is probably the easiest one. Um. The people made mention of Gateway to this project. That being the east gate and the gate is gone, but the plane is there. And I'm hoping my colleagues would support retaining the ellipse in which the plane sits, because there are three planes that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'remind us of the base and Snow High School, Main Street Gate and the East Gate. So that's just my opinion. I think it makes a fine entrance and I would like to see that he lifts. And though we may not have been a medieval fortress, it does evoke the pattern of the base.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's relatively easy. But tying in the more difficult issues, and I think we did it was made mentioned that we learned with buying insurance for remediation that wasn't caught by the sampling in the Navy. And all the agencies have done a great job in sampling and in removing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But sampling is sampling. It's not 100%. And when the backhoes start digging, there may be something found. I want to make sure that in our agreements that the city is not held liable. And as a as an edge to that or a tangent to that is when do the ferry be put in the seaplane lagoon?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There will be dredging needed. Because it's not static. It's like all the marinas and shorelines of the city. There will be periodic dredging needed and has to be explored and handled, particularly with the radium issue. Radioactivity is radium paint.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that needs to be ensured and or anticipated in the course of operations as well as the cost of putting that installation there. Also related to that, there are there are hundreds of feet, if not. A few miles of storm sewer that were exposed to the dumping of radioactive paint.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I remember this, Peter Russell O'Hare, if I remember the meetings when this was first discovered actually quite by accident. Those. I think we need to either make sure we insure or somehow transfer liability to to the new owners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd rather insure it then and and disclose and insure rather than and just hand off liability to somebody else. And then lastly, on the transportation and this would be. Part of that direction to the planning board as well as the Transportation Commission is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please look at this project. In the envelope of and I know we talk about east and west, and the fact is there's a tube and there's a ferry terminal now. And we need to look at the load on that and and looking at it as a whole with the development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's already in our general plan. And this is not in in. And that infrastructure. When we look at the northern waterfront with a housing element, only 245 units. Of. That's in our our housing element. And this is not yet and we have to resolve basically that load.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When we look at this particular project. Those are my comments. I think that transit plan is. As if they're going to be houses there. That's that's absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other member, De Sung.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Mayor Spencer. You know, there's a variety of ways that we need to look at this project. But Chief and foremost, this is what's before us as a council on behalf of the residents. This is a business deal that we're going to make.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in the context of that business deal, one major context is we have to make sure that of the 550 to $600 million in infrastructure cost or all of the base that parcel a make sure that it pays for its share of that overall 550 to $600 million in infrastructure cost.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in order for it to meet its share, we have to have a clear understanding of what are the fiscal impacts of having whatever arrangement of housing that you have in mind, whether it's 25% homeownership and 75% ownership, or whether it's some other percentage, 50, 50 or 75, 25 the other way because the way in which the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the tenure is established might have consequences with regard to how we treat those long term obligations that's going to be associated with the 550 to $600 million. So that's understanding the fiscal impacts in terms of treating Parcel A's share of the overall infrastructure plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we need to make sure to understand that the second fiscal impact we need to understand are certainly the services related to ongoing services related to the different tenure and arrangements. So we're going to need to understand on the on the revenue side, you know, how how much in property taxes and how many how much in property'",
        "'speaker_4': 'taxes? How much in in property transfer taxes? How much in sales taxes are generated under one scenario, whether it's 25% ownership with a 75% apprenticeship versus another scenario, what are the property taxes, transfer taxes, etc., that's generated under, say, a 50% ownership versus a 50% ownership scenario has on the fiscal side, we need to understand how those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'revenues play out relative to whatever costs, municipal costs are associated with it. When we talk about the municipal service district, for example, you know, the residents in Bayport are paying a MSD of roughly $1,000 a year. I mean, you know how you can put on top of the market rent a municipal service district?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As well as other fees. I can put that on and still have a workable project that's 75% rental. I don't know. I'd have to see the details of how that that it's possible. So. We have a serious housing situation, there is no doubt.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's happened here. Right now in Alameda. When we plan alameda point, especially starting with parcel a while, we certainly don't want to forget the housing crisis that we're dealing with. We also have to make long term decisions for, well, decision for the long term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when it comes to looking at the housing tenure, I think that's important. For example, one can conceivably argue that if you had a different housing tenure arrangement. Hypothetical 50% ran or 50% townhouses in condo for sale townhouses and condos.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One could conceivably argue that young adults can move into the townhouse, can start by living in the apartments and transition into the condos and townhouses once they build up their their down payment. And then as they build up equity in those multifamily units, perhaps then move into historic Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we need to look at the housing as a set of flow of services over time that deals with the the evolving needs of the residents. We can't just respond to, as important as it is, the housing crisis that we're dealing with right now in 2015.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there are. So there's a range of information that on the business deal slash fiscal side that I'm certainly interested in looking at. In general, I believe that the process established by city manager John Russo, starting when I started in January 2013, at that time he outlined a vision of how that different things are going to happen'",
        "'speaker_4': ', how we're going to take we're going to do the master infrastructure plan, how we're going to go about doing the zoning, how we're going to go about doing the waterfront so that we can land, put all our ducks in a row so that we're in a position to find the developer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I can't say enough. Kudos to the city manager Russo's approach to this that he started and that he implemented to a tee. And it's important to say because that it was in stark contrast to the two failed attempts where we tried to do everything at once.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we learned our lesson out of that process. I do believe that SRM is the right choice as the developer. So let me let me make sure to say that I like their vision in terms of the retail side, looking at, you know, ways to tap into the creative the emerging creative economy, things like, you know, people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'who who who create things using 3D printers that they can then sell and then generate a sales tax as a result. So making sure to have the retail space or commercial space to accommodate that growing sector. But I will say, though, on the residential side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And let me make sure to say that there are there are no deal killers here. But there are certainly. From my vantage point, I mean, I do think that we have serious concerns about the 2570 5% ratio. I suspect.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It might not even pencil out, you know? I mean, we'll have to look and look at the details to see how it does. And from the backdrop, you know, like I said before, the west end of town has a 70% ownership rate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the longest time, the west end of town has seen Alameda Point as creating a sense of stability. Much needed. I mean, think about it. Think about all the schools that closed in the west end of town. And the closed schools didn't close in the east end of town or the or the central part of town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And all you had Longfellow clothes, you had shipping clothes, and then you had the you know, they were converted to something where you had Woodstock close. I mean, there has been a tremendous amount of social instability in the west end of town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am looking in this project much in the way that I looked at Bayport at that time in 1999. 24 hours, a stabilizing force, not just for Alameda in general, but particularly the west end of town. And I and I say that unapologetically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think there are some I think we've made great strides. I think we're building off the work that was put in place and especially the town planning that. So I'm put together and the presentation in terms of the built environment done by the SRM and their partners tonight falls within that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are some things that I. In terms of the built environment I'd certainly like to look at even more particularly. I mean, I am interested in the quality of the building designs. I encourage people to look at the town center plan because there's a whole section in there that that really discusses thoroughly our expectations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the planning board in that regard I think did a great job and it looks like the SRM is definitely following through on it. But there are some tweaks in here that that in terms of the design and built environment that I'm interested in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the fiscal impacts with regard to dealing with the long term obligations as well as the fiscal impacts with regard to dealing with ongoing municipal services, certainly are also issues as well as obviously transportation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll try to be brief, but I do want to thank the presenters for the presentation. I think it's an exciting project and I'm I'm kind of excited that we're going to have the opportunity to move forward with this after after decades of planning and decades of talking about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So somebody said it's a priority project. I think it's a critical project. We heard from the owner of Palladium on the infrastructure issues that are out there. At the point this morning I was on the phone with one of the other tenants out there and they explained to me how they they have intermittent problems with water supply'",
        "'speaker_0': '. When they have their sewage, they have to put it into a truck and then have the truck drive over and dump their sewage into a sewer. So if we really want to protect and save the businesses that we have out there, let alone attract more like right speed and others, then I think this is a critical project'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to keep moving forward. So when I lived on on Bay Farm, I had the opportunity to work with, with with Joe Ernst and SRM because we lived in the neighboring development. And, you know, I found him to be very open, very accessible and very amenable to changes and suggestions from the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I encourage the public as we go through, we have four more council meetings, we have planning board meetings, we have historical advisory board meetings. I encourage folks to to go talk to Joe, work with the developers. If if you have issues with the designs, if you have issues with the Ellipse, whether you think it should be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'there or not be there, talk to them. And I think you'll find a very amenable and very easy to work with. And I think in the end we'll have a project that the community will not only have input in, but we'll be proud of because it'll be our project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not going to go into the extensive comments that Councilmember Daisuke made, but I do want to say that I, I agree with a lot of the concerns he's raised about the the rental owner owner occupied ratio. So I think as we go forward, I'd be interested in hearing more about that and I'd be interested in having'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the public provide a lot more input on this. But I'm really excited about this. And just one positive point to the reuse. I think that that's a positive part that I think we should continue to do. And I thought somebody said possible reuse, but I hope we can do more definite reuse instead of possible reuse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you to all of our presenters and all of you speakers too. I take copious notes and read them back and it helps inform me. This morning, as I mentioned earlier, I did attend the press event for the opening of the right speed manufacture.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is one of the founders of Tesla motors, has spun off his own company that manufactures these electric drive trains that run motors for trucks, basically to help clean up our environment, because these are especially short haul vehicles like all the garbage trucks that service Marin County in the North Bay Counties.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'FedEx is starting to use them and they're picking up and moving from San Jose, doubling their workforce and coming to Alameda. And I was struck by a comment our city manager, John Russo, made when he was addressing us this morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He called it Back to the Future. And I mean, when you looked at what right speed is is doing, but also back to the future, we're bringing back to Alameda Point what was once there. And of course, I do mean in the nice history that was presented through all these wars and conflicts from World War Two through'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Korea, through Vietnam, the Alameda Point was the Naval Air Station when I was growing up here was both home and business and a work environment. I had friends who lived out there and there were jobs, there were houses, there was retail, the commissary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I remember the gas station because like I said, I went sometimes with my friend's parents when they go shopping, I'm in the commissary and we're getting back to that. But in a much improved way. That and something I remembered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Helen Sise mentioned this in her remarks in the earlier talks about what the community wanted to see for Alameda Point. They wanted connectivity, they wanted continuity because what I remembered about going to the naval base was it was always a little intimidating for me anyway because you always had to go past the guard post and there was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a guard and I don't know if that rifle was loaded or not, but we but what they wanted was streets that went all the way through that invited the public in because after all, this is now our city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It used to be federal property. Some of it still is, but most of it has now been conveyed to the city. So what I saw in the and the plans that were presented. Nice job, David. Israel was a well thought out, well designed, exciting, eclectic mix of jobs, creation, retail, residential, open space.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I love that I mentioned. I love the three different types of park spaces that are there and that will connect to each other. And it did bring to mind for me Granville Island in Vancouver, B.C. My dad was Canadian, he was from Vancouver, and I know Granville Island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, you get there by water. Taxi. I'm and it also reminded me of what the High Line Park in New York has become. If any of you have walked that amazing, amazingly converted space in the former meatpacking district above the you know, it's it's a former railroad elevated roadway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they reclaimed this area that was derelict. It was a place that were, you know, criminal elements. You didn't go there ever unless you were transacting something nefarious. But now it is amazing. It's well used. It has increased the property values of all the places around it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have all that opportunity here. It's a great opportunity. It's a great opportunity for this council. We have a new council. It's a new year and I think we're starting out with a bang. But on a more sober note and Councilmember Odie mentioned this, we did here tonight, we got a letter from radium from the owner'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of Radium Palladium, Brad Shook. And then when we heard this item in December, we had a letter from yet another business owner whose water and telephone lines had been out for days. How do you run a business when you have that sort of thing happening, let alone how do you attract new businesses?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But now we have SRM Ernst in the team they've put together. It's laid out in these plans of what they're putting into the infrastructure. They're paying their fair share. And then some as well as I mean, another lovely amenity is $5 million for a $20 million recreational center that we've long wanted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But anyway, there's there's lots to be done. Mozart has laid out an ambitious schedule for us on the council for other boards and commissions. And you, the public, please come out, you and the audience, you who are watching come out, attendees, open houses go on the walk the bike ride a year ago was amazing and get involved'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And at the same time, for me anyway, I feel I truly believe we picked the right development partners. They know what they're doing. They have experts. That's not to say that we won't give them input and we won't give them guidance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't feel the need to micromanage every step of the way because we pick them to make good decisions for us. But at this point in time, I would just say, let's all use our best efforts, get together, get behind this very exciting prospect for a city that really has involved so many people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From all you dedicated volunteers on the RAB who've been making sure that the cleanup is going as it should to all the boards, commissions, our city staff. Jennifer Ord I was thinking about this the other night. We would be lost without you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She is just a fountain of knowledge and an understanding about the most technical details and and never thinks any of my questions are dumb. But anyway, I. I'm really excited about this. I want to get in there and roll up my sleeves and work with with the rest of you, because I think we have a great opportunity'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for Alameda in front of us. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I'm going to say my comments at this point. First of all, I want to thank the community for coming out and sharing your concerns. I want to thank Steph as well as the developer for doing their presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I appreciate the comments from my my fellow council members. I have. In regards to the jet, I actually support as much of a historical anything historical out there that we can protect. I personally like the circles. I like the Jets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like the names of the roads as much as we can protect. I think it's actually what is unique about Alameda. So as much as we can do on that, I do support you, the Hornet and the the jet in regards to these depictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's very important that what is depicted be accurate. So I would appreciate that these drawings be corrected. And and the presentation actually is different from the sequence that was presented online, if that could also be corrected online.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My concerns and some of these I personally prefer and I know that this is maybe get into the details, but I prefer and I think that you may be a lead developer as much green as possible reuse of materials is I do I like the natural looks of some of these drawings look to me I'm not sure'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what materials were being used, but if we can reuse materials, I think as much as possible. Okay. I have concerns about the transportation and I'm hoping that we'll see more information of what that's actually going to look like and the impact, the cumulative impact across the city with all of the current developments that are already online as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'well as this additional. But that's really going to look like for the impact. The cumulative impact from adding this project to the traffic through the tube. What will that look like in regards to and I appreciate that we're we will be encouraging bus transportation, having shuttles and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And maybe our latest company out there can help us be more green on how to do that. I think that that would be great if we could utilize like a shuttle or something. I'm not sure. But try and keeping in mind that we have a goal as a region to reduce the impact as a state, to reduce'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2030. I'm one I really want to know how this can how we are supporting that safety day. There was a letter to the editor recently, and I appreciate whomever wrote it in regards to day to day safety that that the again, the cumulative impact of another development, whether including housing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and jobs, resulting in more traffic actually across the island and looking at that. Safety during an emergency. I would like us to know again how we will be evacuating, how we will be addressing a natural disaster. This to me, this is an we will be having more people over there shopping and working, living here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The cumulative impact. The skill analysis I would like to see. So I know we discussed some numbers, but we need a budget for the entire project and and its impact on our services long term. The city services. How we're going to preserve the services long term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In regards to the ratio of the 75% apartments and then the 25% affordable housing. Now, that's not the breakdown. I'd like to see the breakdown of what we're actually talking about. Or are we talking about all the apartments for the below market rate housing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that a combination? Where is the 25% below market rate housing from the 75 with the 75% apartments? And then what is the range of those apartments? And as much as I appreciate that we have an issue with rents increasing in this town.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I look at the picture and I'll be looking for staff also to clarify what this looks like, as far as I can discern, the city's ability to control the housing price is through below market rate housing that apartments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unless somehow they are that below market rate housing can be out of reach for many current aluminum quote unquote market rate. And who will the landlord be? This is city property. If the will this be privately held? In which case I don't know how the city will have any controls over market rate housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, especially apartments. And when people can buy an entry level, an entry home, at least they have something that they know what the payment will be. And what we're seeing right now is the payments are escalating to uncertain levels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think. So I'd I'd like to know how we can big picture look at this as a city. Another concern of mine is that when we have private developers that use private property to develop, then we are limited as a city in regards to the percentage of affordable housing, whether it be or seniors or whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this is city property and that is my understanding where the city has actually the say of what type of housing and what we want this to look like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Mayor, I have a question on what you just stated. Yes, my understanding is that properties can be conveyed to become to the from city owned property, to be private property, and they'll develop that against our standards that are laid out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's not going to be city property, it's going to be acquired, if I understand it. Can this be verified that I understand this correctly? That this will be city transfer of public property to a private individual. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To develop against the standards that are laid out by the plan. Correct. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To a private company or development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is going from public to private land.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Except for the public right away. We will essentially transfer the property to them. They're going to build our infrastructure. Then they'll transfer the public right of ways back to us. So. So there will be portions that will come back to us once they're improved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the majority that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Private parts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Might not be under private.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'EMS. Not. But they will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Be required to develop the property in accordance with the disposition development agreement. And they will be subject to those terms. And so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I may just go for it jumps out of my head is that these pictures and the the plans and and the deliverables basically are exciting to look at it. And but they all have impacts. And are we going to get a briefing on the finances that are going to be hammered out in the development agreement'",
        "'speaker_0': '? Because in past experience, the pictures are pretty. But the deal and I think council member de Saag hit the nail on the head is the word penciled? I haven't heard once in the presentation and that's usually what that's what killed the first two deals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that the promised in pencil? Mm hmm. And there are other can other conditions that the city might have when when when private land, a public land becomes private land. And what are the things do we want? Project labor agreements, prevailing wage, sustainable systems that provide that transportation of because there's no free bus passes because someone pays'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for them and it's the owner that's going to pay for the transportation, not the potentially not the developer, unless the developer remains as the owner. So all those financial type questions. I'm hoping we get another another briefing where we put the pictures aside and talk about the money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can do that. I mean, I think the question is really I mean, for instance, we did a fiscal impact analysis as part of our previous internal efforts. We are in the process of updating that fiscal model for this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we'll be looking at that and not just at build out, but over time so that we can see are there initial years before a lot of development has occurred where there might be greater impacts because you don't have the revenue yet from development to cover some of your expenses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, what are we looking at over a certain number of years to make till we get to build out of the projects so that you can see the full impact of the project from a municipal services standpoint. We'll look at that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can, you know, with that model, we can test some of the impacts of the ten year mix. So we can look at that and we can and we can brief you on those results. But that's absolutely part of it because there is a fiscal neutrality policy that the city has, that this project has to be fiscally'",
        "'speaker_6': 'neutral in the city's municipal general fund budget. And we, our staff, take that very seriously. And we need to actually be we want to prove to ourselves and to you and to the community that this, in fact, will be fiscally neutral.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we are analyzing that now. And then the question of I think you you're getting at is, you know, you pay for all these different things with special taxes from property owners. And there is kind of a limit as to how much you can burden property owners with that they're going to be willing to pay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we need to make sure and we're doing this analysis as well, is that there's enough, you know, burden or enough you know, there's enough room to pay for all these this these things within kind of where we think the market dictates property owners would be willing to pay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're analyzing that as well. Some of the financial questions and policy direction may come to the council in closed session under real property negotiations and many other pieces of it that come in open session. We'll have to talk with our developers and and with the city attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if their price in terms of payment, you know, we want to protect the city's best interests in terms of negotiating. We don't actually want to negotiate in public with the developer. So there may be aspects that come to you in closed session.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We haven't determined that, but we can come back to you in one form or another with with updates to about the fiscal impact analysis and about the final financing plan, which is, I think what you what you're asking about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But those are all analyzes that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So sorry. Let me continue, please, regarding the fiscal impact, not just at that site, but cumulative, because people these people will be driving on the road, for instance, Webster to how are we going to address when are the wear and tear on our streets the necessity for more services whether it be fireplace things like that to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just flesh out a little bit more detail in terms of, you know, what I mean by the fiscal consequences of of, you know, having. Very low rate of ownership. I mean, when you look at owner occupied properties among the range of revenues, property tax revenue, you know, or revenues that could be generated, you've got the property tax'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And to the extent that the owner occupied units are resold and therefore reassessed upwards, then over time one unit will generate even more property taxes, even if we use the same 1% ad valorem plus all the other add ons.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in addition to that. When you have these owner occupied, they're sold and resold and that generates another stream of property taxes, all the real estate transfer tax. So in these a variety of revenues we're contemplating, I think, towards paying for a parcel, a share of the overall 550 to $600 million in infrastructure, as well as contemplate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'towards paying for municipal services. Now, on on the when you have a property that's 75% of which is rental, that, you know, I really doubt that the rental property is going to be sold and resold at an any extensive rate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Therefore, generating the same kind of trigger as the property tax trigger or the or the. And so so that's a little bit more fixed. And then to make the compounded, I, you know, I wonder to what extent you can add on fees to rental properties to recover some of the things that we've discussed about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are the fiscal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I wrote those things down. So I've heard you loud and clear. And we will be talking with the developer about that ten year mix and looking at the sensitivity and impacts that ten year mix ratio project. So I we will that'll be something we'll report back to you on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'd like to see currently the type of housing that we already have. And it could be citywide, it could be just the new housing however you want, you know, just so that we have information. And then if you add the apartments and townhomes or whatever these are, the ideas are so that we can look at big'",
        "'speaker_2': 'picture of what what the different types of housing that's online that isn't out there right now. And then overall, what our city will look like and I am concerned about having 75% of apartments. I think I don't know how you will address the rate rising rent issue and how people will be able to come here and be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'able to settle. So so I would like to look at that. And also, I'm interested in looking at a higher percentage of affordable housing. It was great. Thank you very much. Any other comments? Thank you very much. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks mainly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A next item.'",

Good evening. My name is Claudio Young and I'm with the Housing Authority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm the Housing Community Development Program Manager. So what is CDBG, CDBG as an entitlement jurisdiction? We receive community development block grant funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. These funds are currently used for residential rehab, which you heard my colleague Miriam talk about earlier.'"
    ],
    "Housing and Community Development Needs Statement Approval.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'And we also use them for non housing, community development programs in projects for public services, economic development and public facilities and infrastructure. The program. First purpose is to develop a viable urban community, primarily for low and moderate income persons through decent housing, suitable living environment and economic opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the past five years, CDBG funded programs have served between seven and 8000 individuals per year. The city is required to prepare a five year strategic plan, which outlines a priority needs that will inform the CDBG funding decisions for the upcoming five year period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also to receive CDBG funding. The city is required to submit to HUD an annual action plan detailing the program's activities and resources to address the housing and community development needs as outlined in the five year strategic plan. These will come before you in May of this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In addition, there's priorities among the needs of the non housing, community development, social services, the Social Services and Human Relations Board. Shrub provides a refined priority statement to reflect the social services needs in the community, which is included as Exhibit one in your packet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This will be included as a part of the RFP that will be going out specifically for public services. And the RFP is tentatively scheduled to be released this Thursday pending your approval today. So in October of last year, we had an a community outreach meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In attendance was three housing authority staff members and 27 community members. Groups that were represented from the City Alameda Department was the Community Development Department, Public Works, Park and Rec and the Fire Department. In addition, there was the Commission on Disabilities, the Mastic Senior Center and Social Services Human Relations Board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nonprofit providers such as the Food Bank, Building Futures, Family Violence Law, Eden Housing and Alameda Point Collaborative. And also residents. A summary of the discussion of the needs is included as exhibit two. Some of these needs included. Large scale collaboration grant writing for leveraging funds to fill the CDBG gaps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Services for elderly abuse and aging in place. Family Services. Homeless Services. Other housing services such as. Supportive Housing. Transitional housing of. Shelter for the chronically homeless and then economic development needs, such as facade improvements, business loans and job training.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Business plans. Exhibit three of your packet includes all of the priority needs that will be included in the five year consolidated plan. Staff received. Staff received comments from the County Housing and Community Development Department and the County Home Consortium, which the city is a part of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So staff would like to make three edits and the original priority needs for affordable housing in order to be parallel with the county. Those three edits include the second point under affordable housing. Rather than reducing the household to sorry, we want to reduce the household from 128 AMI to 80% AMI.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, we want to combine the third and fourth point to read as reduce housing discrimination, which will automatically cover all who are discriminated against fair housing and tenant landlord services. And we would like to add a point to assist low and moderate income first time homebuyers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the the process for the needs starts with the Social Services and Human Relations Board, which is which has already happened. On November 20th, 2014, the Social Services Human Relations Board heard all the comments from our community outreach meeting, heard additional public comments at that meeting, and incorporated that into their needs statement, which is included in your'",

And the third process for the needs will be that the RFP will be released based on all the priority needs. Exhibit four is scheduled to complete both a five year strategic plan and the annual action plan for the upcoming fiscal year'",
        "'speaker_1': '20 1516. And that concludes my report. And I'm not sure if there's somebody here from Shrub to speak at Amir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a question. I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So one of your recommendations to be aligned with the county is to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The target population of who are grantees. Support from 120% of I to 80% of am I. That would be the threshold. So we're looking for anyone who's we're looking for grantees. We're looking to fund grantees who support households who are at 80% or below of am I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So only for for the second point. The the original point said preserve existing affordable rental housing and ownership for households of below 120%. So we want to reduce that to 80. So for example, a family of four at 120%, they have to make 110,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we want to reduce that to 67,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So basic. But the key thing is what we're really saying is we want to target our limited CDBG funds away from moderate income families, which is the definition of 80 to 100% of my low income and lower.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. It'll allow us to be more flexible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you. Or do we need to do something? I think we need to do something at this time. Then I'll ask my question. That clock's actually a little bit so fast. Didn't 1029 according to my iPad. Did anyone else have clarifying questions on this right now?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I did, but you go ahead and do what you need to do. So at this point, I'll just go ahead and do it. We need four votes to consider additional items. Do we have. Does anyone want to move that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do that. All those in favor. I oppose none. Motion carries. All right. So so my question then, I thank you for your report missing. I'm looking at the and by the way, all of the needs and everything you do and or address in these reports are so well needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wish there was more money to go around, but I applaud you for trying to do the triage here. So I was looking at the exhibit two, which was the summary of the Community Outreach Workshop on October 22nd of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And on page two, there is a discussion about housing and then public services and the homeless. And, and I don't disagree with anything that's on here. It's actually kind of heart rending to, says, domestic violence survivors, elder abuse, homeless shelter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But one of the categories that I don't see, although maybe it's can contain elsewhere in this report, is we hear a lot about young people who age out of the foster care system in the state because at 18 you've aged out of the foster care program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yet for anyone who's raised children, you know that they do not magically become mature young adults at the age of 18 in a day. Is there anything within these proposals that would catch that group or is the county doing things?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it would be under affordable housing and in public services. So we kept the categories in the parades a little bit vague to give us some flexibility to be more specific every year as things come up. So we'll revisit, for example, for public services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We definitely revisit the priorities every single year to see what's happening in our community. The needs are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, thank you. And then on page three of that same summary, there was a line item about unsheltered and chronic homeless, including homeless veterans. And I had participated and so did the mayor. Before she was the mayor, she was on the school board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then when do we do that? In the fall or the when we did the walk early in the morning to try to get a count of the homeless on our streets. And one of the things that we were told is that a larger percentage of homeless are homeless veterans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think I understand that the VA, the Veterans Administration has some programs because that was one of the referral sources for for us on the walk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. So there they work with one of our service providers, but we're definitely going to be looking into how we can zone in to the extremely low and the chronically homeless, I think is one of the goals for the county as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Right. Okay. Thank you. All right. Any other comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Request? Yes. I notice that in the groups represented from the city of Alameda, the Alameda Police Department is not mentioned. And I know and in the past they were quite participatory and as a service provider and they're often the first people who come into contact with a homeless person representing the city or are often called upon for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'service and in some of the public housing units. So my request is that as you go through the process, that if they weren't present there, that you can integrate the service that they do provide in your implementation of of the of the services that are going to be funded by the grants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we definitely look at that. When we go through the RFP and look at collaboration. So many of our service providers are actually working with the police department. So for example, Family Violence Law Center Building Features.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda Collaborative, selected the logos and all of them have a connection. There is interaction with the police and I'm hoping that there that they get a seat at the table as you go forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I was just going to add and in fact, it was the police department that that organized the walk that we went on. And I will shout out to a particular officer, Elisa Ledbetter. She's an amazing resource of of knowledge and in different services in our city and all over the county for various homeless and other other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'folks who were just out and down on their luck. And it's not always necessarily a crime, but as the vice mayor noted, that the police are often the first to encounter people in these situations. But, you know, they're definitely there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know if their logo wasn't presented just because they weren't looking for anything.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just didn't have enough room yet. But we definitely work with them and I'll make sure they're at the table.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they are great. Thank you. I want to confirm you finished giving your presentation. All right. And we do not have any public speakers. This is the first part of this agenda item is a public hearing. There were no slips turned in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wait a minute. One is coming up. It. So do I need to open the public hearing then, since we have a speaker now. So. Yeah. So I'm going to open the public hearing for this item. You may proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, and this, of course, I'm kind of in between. Hi. My name's Jennifer Bolan. Hi, Madam Mayor. And council members. I came from building opportunities and out of your homeless program and am in need of your disabled housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this pertains to me, but I currently live in a private housing program or I'm currently privately housed, so we need to maintain the other housing because I may end up back there. So part of the needs thing is to maintain.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when you're developing the rental thing is to have senior and disabled housing. Because I came out of building opportunities and I may end up needing the rental or ending up back on Alameda Point because when I can't afford the other housing, I'm going to need the senior and disabled housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that way I don't end up homeless and back on the streets here in Alameda. And because if you keep developing and I can't afford the other housing, I'm going to need the disabled housing. And if they raise that, the rate that you have to make so little money or too much money because I am on SSDI'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and I don't make a lot of money, but I'm. Too rich for Section eight, but too poor to make rent. So I'd appreciate if you could include those of us that make like $1,000 a month in this needs category.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I'm 51 and I do go to Mastic and I do go to I came out of building futures and I really appreciate those programs. And, you know, if you keep funding Midway Shelter. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a question. Yes. For us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is our public hearing, though, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can close the public hearing, go to an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Audition if there's no more slips on it. I'm going to now close the public hearing on this idea. Thank you, everybody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. My interpretation, what the resident had just said, was that she is at a certain income that is above the 80% AMI because she cannot she is not eligible for Section eight in section eight, you know, certainly has its income triggers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to the extent that she is not eligible for Section eight, that tells me that she's above that 80%. Am I? So the implications of what we're doing with regard to housing and change from changing the threshold from 120% of AMI, which is the top bracket for moderate to focusing just on 80% or below the implications of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that are tweeters like her would be were would could be affected. So the question is. Is that altogether possible? You have a special continue with the transition from 120 to 80%, am I, as you're suggesting, but have a certain dispensation with regard to age?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So whoever because age is a protected category and in special needs housing. So age. So if you're 55 and over and you and you're anywhere between 80 to 120%. Am I then that will be an exception to the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's something to think about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So in the in the first point, it actually includes 30% AMI and 50% AMI for rental. But if we want to be more specific, you can make any of these points just a little bit more specific to prioritize seniors or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anything that you want. But it does include 30% and 50% AMI for rental.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, I know, but. But she wouldn't even be eligible for that because she's above 80%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She's the age was 51.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The age at this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What she was saying is, though, is she the way that she was framing it is. But she would like he might need it in the future, because the extent that she's 51 now, perhaps in four years and she's just one individual of it, perhaps is altogether illustrative of the dimensions that we need to look at this issue'",
        "'speaker_1': '. So we can make it a more refined priority and add that we want to give priority to senior housing or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I rely on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when do we revisit this item? Would it be in a year from now? You you'd give us an update. This is an annual.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So these are for the five years. And every year I come to you with the needs for that year in case we need to refine every year anything to be more specific to our needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you keep track of people that are not included that reach out to you for help if we are whose needs we're meeting and who we need to? Really, maybe we do need to reevaluate that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be great. And then on this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madumere, just one more point. And the reason why I'm pushing this like I just did is because I think there has to be something said about someone taking the time to come to a public hearing to talk about this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while I don't know if you know what she has to say is statistically representative of her income and age cohort, I do know that she took the time to come here tonight. So in that respect, I would hope that, you know, she and others see that this city council is trying our best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this side and we had the public hearing, but we also need to my understanding, we need to approve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Approve the priority needs with the changes that I submitted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, sir. Do we have a motion? So moved all those in favor. I, I oppose and motion carries. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next item is six H report from a.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. I'm Debbie Potter. I'm the city's community development director. And I was going to do a brief introduction to this item and then turn it over to Jeff Canberra, who is going to report out on the community process that he's engaged in over the last three or four months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this issue of examining the impact of rising rents in the city of Alameda came out of the city's process of adopting its housing element in the summer of 2014. And there were a number of groups that were interested in seeing the housing element reflect a policy on the impact of rising rents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in lieu of including that policy in the housing element, the City Council directed staff in July to to study this issue and come back with a proposal on how to how to respond to the issues that had been raised in the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And staff did come back to the Council in September of 2014. And at that time, staff made a recommendation that the Council appoint a seven member task force that would be charged with answering four questions. And the four questions that the task force was being recommended to look at were the following What is the state of the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'residential rental market in Alameda? What have been the impacts on rental rates, supply of rental housing and the physical condition of rental housing in jurisdictions with rent control? Stabilization ordinances? What changes, if any, need to be made to the city's rent review advisory committee?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what changes, if any, need to be made to the Alameda Municipal Code relative to residential rental housing? So those were the questions that staff was recommending. The seven member task force be charged with exploring with a report back to the city council with recommendations based on that analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm. Staff's recommendation was made to the council. There were representatives from the community that were suggesting and recommending to the council that an alternate process be put together, which was a community engagement process, to bring together the various stakeholders and have a community wide discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And ultimately that is what the Council. Determined it would do and it deferred and set aside staff's recommendation in lieu of this community process, which Jeff Canberra had volunteered to lead and has been leading for the last three or four months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this time he has concluded the community work that he has undertaken and he is prepared to present to the Council the process that that he guided and the recommendations that came out of that process. So with that overview, I would like to turn the podium over to Jeff, who will present to the Council regarding the effort'",

My name is Jeff Canberra and I am the community facilitator for the Alameda Rental Housing Community Discussion Group on September 16th. I came to the council and asked for the opportunity to to create an interest based community discussion regarding rental housing issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The objective of this process was to establish a structure where the city's tenants and housing providers could work collaboratively to develop solutions to rental housing issues. Drawing on their own experience, research and resources available from other jurisdictions and organizations.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'outcome. It is not the intention of this group to in any way have these discussion points be developed into provisions that would function as rent control. Tenants and housing providers have expressed the interest to remain actively involved in all stages of the refinement of these points and to work closely with city staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tonight's update will involve three presentations. I will briefly describe the process used to develop the six points Angela Hawk about of the Alameda Renters Coalition will provide a tenant perspective. And Don Lindsay, one of the city's major housing providers who has been actively involved in the Alameda housing market for many years, will provide additional support.'",

Two examples of maintenance issues and fear of being priced out of the rental market in Alameda due to rising rents.'",

Owners and managers of the larger properties indicated that over the 8 to 10 year return figures were very low and at least one housing provider indicated that their practice was to take reasonable rents annually.

        "'speaker_0': '. Based on the two public meetings and several individual tenant and housing provider meetings. The most pressing issues involved the need for an accurate and reliable data collection point to identify individual situations where a small number of housing providers were noticing significant rent increases and developing a method for informing tenants of their ability to have a rent increase'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Case heard by our Rent Review Advisory Committee. At this point, the project focus its efforts on the community's presenting problem and concentrated its energies on addressing these two issues. In the individual tenant and landlord group meetings, participants focused on improving the existing mediation process offered by the RAC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The suggested suggestions coming from the participants. Improving the city's current mediation process coincided with Iraq's areas of inquiry after getting support from both tenant and housing provider groups. A focus group of tenant and landlord interest was created to vet the six points and get authorization to distribute them to the larger groups and eventually to the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The six points are discussion. Point one involves the failure of the tenant of a tenant and housing private provider to participate in a hearing in good faith.

Discussion point three requires that a notice of option to participate in Iraq hearing be given in writing with any notice of'",

The focus group unanimously approved points one through four for the release to the larger groups and to the general public. Eight out of nine members approved point number five, and there was no agreement on point number six.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'However, the group members were representative of the various tenant and housing interests that we believe we have in the city. The third meeting was held on January 7th involving the presentation of the six discussion points that originated in the public meetings and were reinforced in individual tenant and housing provider point of view meetings held after the public'",
        "'speaker_0': 'meeting. These six points are not to be considered direct recommendations to the City Council. They are presented to the Council in order to get authorization for staff to continue to refine the six points if authorized. A meeting with staff could be set up in the next several weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ms. may talk about we'll be presenting shortly. I want to make sure that everybody's clear that she'll be presenting and then she will introduce Mr. Lindsey.

Our membership has grown to nearly 400 members, many of whom are afraid that they could be pushed out of their homes by sudden high rent increases at any time in the current legal climate and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'just have 30 to 60 days to find alternative housing. There isn't enough diverse, affordable housing in Alameda. This limited supply means that some landlords are raising rents as high as they can, and some landlords are using exorbitant increases to push out existing tenants to raise rents even higher.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is unfair to renters who have little recourse under Alameda Law to stay in their homes. Earlier. We did have a lot more renters here, but there were families here. And as it's gotten too late, they've had to leave.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there's some of them represented, right cases where there were 20, 47% and even 30% increases. And over the last year, during 2014, 40 households felt the need that their rent increases were so high that they made the application to the Rent Review Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That sounds like a lot of people to me who feel at risk of losing their homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, could I just have you reiterate, did you say last year 40 people made retirement, have filed.'",
        "'speaker_1': '40 households made applications? Maybe not all of them were heard by the RAC. Maybe some of them were negotiated before there was a meeting. Okay. But there were 40 households that actually approached it and had maybe some of them are also from individual buildings where there are multiple units within a building and they all presented at the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'same time. But they still represent individual households. Okay. Thank you. We recognize that this doesn't resent represent the majority of housing providers in Alameda who make reasonable rent increases and take good care of their properties. However, these exorbitant, exorbitant rent increases are still a problem that the city must address.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jeff Canberra's rental housing discussions have educated the community on the issues at hand. Renters and housing providers were able to join together and discuss each other's challenges. It turned out that many Alameda landlords disagreed with the exorbitant rent increases that pushed families out of their homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At the same time, it was clear that renters understood the need for reasonable rent increases. This mutual understanding built a strong foundation for renting and property interests to discuss possible solutions. We hope to continue these discussions in good faith.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As a renter and Landlord Alliance organization during this period of discussions, the Rent Review Advisory Committee presented details about this, their process and offered some ideas that they thought might make the rec more effective. We were able to discuss these ideas in several focus groups and exchange different points of view on what was feasible or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jeff Canberra has just presented the results, the six points that will strengthen the Rent Review Advisory Committee. We believe that they are a starting point for city staff to explore exorbitant rent increases and study solutions that have already been vetted by a public renter and housing provider.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Focus group. We hope that such measures will discourage housing providers from making these 20, 30 and 40% increases. However, still more work needs to be done. More data needs to be collected, and more serious study is needed on how to prevent these increases in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I hope the city will take the time to review how other cities have tackled the problem and find additional ways to ensure fairness in the rental market. A stronger rent review advisory committee will tell renters that they might have a fair chance at staying in their homes and will tell the landlords who make such increases that they'",
        "'speaker_1': 'will have to answer for them on public record in front of a civic body city council. I hope you will direct city staff to review these proposals and offer a report back to City Council within six months. The Alameda Renters Coalition would be more than happy to work with city staff as a helpful resource.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much for your time and consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I just want to clarify for everyone, this is still part of the presentation. And that's why she was allowed to speak more than 3 minutes and. Now, Mr. Lynch, you may continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madame Mayor. Members of the City Council and staff. My name is Donna Lindsay, and I've been in the real estate profession in Alameda for a few decades. We'll put it that way. I have been involved really from the beginning of this process with with Jeff and I, I, I have a few comments on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have been totally supportive of the process. I think it was wise to. To get people involved that as Jeff did, that are directly involved either as a renter or as a provider or a manager. And I think that was it kind of we kind of got to it in a hurry with with those kinds of interests'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being involved in the process. They were true stakeholders as. As we're called. And. And I think through the process that we've all become more aware if we haven't been aware of. You know, the problems that exist and some of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Details as to kind of where we where we are today. We have explained, I think in in great in detail of the the business of owning and managing renting apartments. It's business like anything else. We've been confronted with rising costs, of course, and we've been involved in changing markets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there are those here that I'll speak to that. So I won't go into a lot of detail on that. Alameda has a lot of diverse housing stock because, as we all know, the owners consist primarily of alum Edens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's really important. We care about Almeida. We like owning property in Alameda. And we believe in just the. The idea of fairness, and we definitely frown on excessive rent increases. That's that's not what we're about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's it's not fair. It's it puts a tremendous burden on a resident to get a huge rent increase. And we're we're totally against that concept. We as a community because we care and because we're special, we're different. We can we can work through these issues, through this mediation process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The the process has worked. Generally, there have only been a couple of cases that have been brought before the council in the last couple of years. It generally generally works well. I've gone through the details pretty, pretty carefully, and we've got history that goes back to 2008 or 2007.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there were years when the rec didn't even have a case because of the market. And you'll hear more about that as we. Continue to talk this evening. The idea of strengthening the RAC is the we feel the best solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The word should be out there that the RAC is available. And, you know, if if an increased notice is given, there should be information that tells the resident if that if they have a if they have a problem with the increased it, that they can appeal it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That that's one of the main things that the first thing that we agreed upon is the RAC should have a higher profile and there should be no excuse why I didn't know the RAC existed. So that's that's very important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's moving forward. I think it's extremely important that that we continue to talk to and promote the idea of reasonableness with with all property owners in the community. I think we're we're good at that. I think we need to work to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Kind of fact, I talked to and Angela Angela this morning about this of of forming a coalition of owners and managers and renters alike. Let's form a group and continue to work on these issues and head off the issues really before they get to the RAC stage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've got eco housing that helps and they've been doing a great job in solving some issues before they get to the RAC. Let's let's add an additional layer of people in the community of owners and let's, let's talk to each other if, if increase comes in and, and it can't get resolved right away, there's nothing better than'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one owner talking to another owner and saying, hey, this is not the way we do things. So I think that's something we can develop and improve upon. We have great resources in our management companies here. We can work with residents who have a particular problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's that's what we do for a living. We we rent properties and manage properties so we we can help relocate. Relocate people. Let's let's let's move forward. Let's strengthen the rack and make it more visible. You'll have you'll have a better way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Assessing. You know, if if if there's a problem, there'll be no excuse for not knowing about it. It'll be there in a year from now or so. You'll have a better understanding of of what's going on in the rental market.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, just in closing, we're really good and working together. And let's let's move, move forward doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And at this point, I'll need a motion to continue the meeting beyond 11 seconds. All those in favor. I thank you. Now, honestly, past. So. QUESTION So did anyone have clarifying questions? We do have speakers on this item that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you do plan to speak on this, please submit your slip. You know, do I have any questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I was going to defer to allow me to go first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've I've got a couple. So this is probably for both our landlord and tenant representatives, if you would. And I, by the way, I appreciate the your involvement, all of your involvement, the three of you. And I should quickly disclose that I met last week, I think it was with Mr. Lindsay and a group of landlords at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'his offices. And prior to that, a day or two prior, I met with Laura Thomas of Renewed Hope. So I'm trying to, you know, hear all sides of this issue. Thank you all for your work. I know, Mr. Lindsay, you said that this process generally works well, that the RAC process, it's out there when you can get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'people to talk to each other, that generally works. But I also read in the comments in the report that Mr. Cameron submitted that and I think it was Laura Thomas of renewed hope, said that she had some tenants who in fact chose to remain anonymous because they were concerned with retaliation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It sounds good to say, well, just talk to your landlord. But I think we could all imagine a situation where you felt that talking to your landlord would be the worst possible thing you could do. So how how would you how would you deal with that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the the issue where some tenants are just afraid to speak up and talk to their landlord about an increase to try to negotiate on their own. And the other thing, and this was one of the five or six points that are proposed is that well, and also I would just throw out my opinion that it's not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'exactly a level playing field, because obviously the landlord owns that building and the tenant needs a place to live. But the requirement is the same. Each has to show up or they can't avail themselves of legal processes. But under the proposal, all the landlord has to do is show up at the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then, as we discussed at Mr. Lindsay's office, they could still impose a 65% rent increase because they showed up at the hearing. So if you could maybe merge those two concerns and Angela, you look ready to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'James so ready. All right. One of the reasons I started the Alameda Renters Coalition was because there wasn't enough support for renters in this marketplace to empower themselves to use the services that are available to them. I myself endured a $450 rent increase in 2013 that forced me out of my home, and I had to move in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with my mother in law, where I currently reside at Bay Farm Island. And when that happened to me as someone who was a good renter and had periodic every year $75 rent increases, and I had gotten a $75 rent increase that year to all of a sudden in August, four months after my initial rent increase to get'",
        "'speaker_1': 'an additional $450 rent increase felt like a slap in the face. I felt little recourse. And when I investigated the rack, investigated eco housing, I really didn't get a lot of support. And I felt that it might not be kind of me to try to air my my problems in public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And fortunately, I found the strength to negotiate with my landlord so that I could afford to stay in my apartment for a few months before we could make the arrangements to move in with my mother in law. But in that process, I was very much alone, and I felt like this was my problem, this was my fault'",
        "'speaker_1': ', that I had no one else to help me. And so out of that, after realizing on all the different social media for Alameda that really there wasn't a lot of public support for renters, that an organization needed to be started to provide that support.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so what we are trying to do and in the process of doing we're an infant, we've only been around since September, is to provide education and emotional and practical support to renters. And that is part of a hopefully a larger picture involving Mr. Lindsay and other housing providers in Alameda to work together to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They have an amazing process where they all talk among themselves. They don't like these exorbitant rent increases. And I'm pretty sure that when somebody makes those rent increases, they hear about it. And I think we can all work together to bring renters to the table, to take advantage of the services that they have and make them more'",
        "'speaker_1': 'educated consumers as well. So I think that if the city staff comes back with some of these recommendations to make a stronger crack, it will be part of a larger ecosystem of rental housing, and especially if we're working together, cooperate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lee. Where we can try to decrease these exorbitant rent increases. I mean, there are other problems as well. I'm hearing from renters that even 10% rent increases are difficult for them because they're happening that high year after year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And at this point, because rents are so high. 10% can represent represent hundreds of dollars. And so I'm hoping that we can engage the housing provider community to find ways of easing those rent increases, because we recognize and we understand that significant costs are included as part of taxes, as part of improvements to units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, what does it say about the provider if they raise rents so high that a person can't afford to live there who has made the investment of living there for year after year? And in this market where there are few rentals available, it is nearly impossible to find a replacement housing within 30 to 60 days'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And I was just lucky. I was lucky that my mother in law has lived in Alameda since 1967 and that she had a house for me to go to. I was the best case scenario for that housing provider, and there are people who are definitely not as lucky as I am.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why I'm here and that's why I'm started this organization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two quick questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you want to respond, Mr. Lindsey?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, Mr. Lindsey. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's see my comments. If if if I were a resident here and I got a 25 or 30% increase, I wouldn't keep it a secret. Somebody is going to know about it. That's that's sort of my attitude. And if the racks available, I'm going to go to the rack and get it resolved, or I'm going to sit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'down with it with the owner and try and get it resolved. I'm going to go to echo housing and try and get it resolved. I can't do that. I'm going to go to Rack. If I can't get it resolved there, I'll go to the council, which has happened, what, two times in the last two years in this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'whole process. So that's my answer to the first question. I'm not going to keep it a secret and worry about retaliation, which is not legal anyway, and it's not right. But I'm not going to be kept secret. That's the second question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That the landlord just has to show up and then can raise the rent any percentage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, well I don't see those cases at the rack and I've, I've looked through them pretty carefully for the last couple of years and someone comes in with an increase and it gets resolved pretty typically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, remember we discussed the Benton. The Benton.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we we all know about Benton Street and we all know about Park Street. Those were two different cases that they eventually worked out. Okay. But those those are not. Those are not good. But, you know, we have, what, 16,000 rental units here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think percentage wise, it's pretty much new. But I'd just like to address one other thing briefly. There was a case last week. No, two weeks ago. Iraq had seven residents who appeared objecting to an 18% increase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the owner who lives out of town came in and basically said, no, I'm not going to deal with you. And he left. And that was the end of it. I did talk to I did finally get to the owners after the hearing, although I left a message for them before the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And long story short, a couple of days ago, they agreed to go to the 10%. So it peer peer pressure does work and it's just being involved and working on these things. So that's that's a comment I have on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Any other clarifying questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To two brief ones? The recommendation is that we enhance or strengthen the process. Can you briefly tell us what the process is now? As quickly as that. Maybe that's Miss Potter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Well, just. Just quickly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think this doesn't really.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Matter that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do have 16 speakers and 3 minutes. That's 48 minutes. I'd like to get to them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And two and one of the speakers is David Perry, the chair of the RAC and another RAC member this evening. But quickly, we have on the housing authorities website there is a rent increase complaint form. If you feel like you've had a rent increase that you want to have mediated, you fill out that form.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Staff will take it in and it will. The RAC meetings are scheduled as there are cases that the RAC meets once a month. It is a voluntary process. The tenant and the property owner are invited to come to the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Both sides present their. They're their side of the story. The rack makes rack members can make suggestions about think of this, think of that. And often times most of the time, they're those recommendations are taken and the two parties agree to to go with what the rack has recommended.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And typically the rack encourages rent increases that are 10% or less and encourages folks to increase their rent annually so that you have less likelihood that you're going to get a large one time increase. But Rack does not deal with maintenance issues or fair housing issues or anything else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They deal with rent increases and staff can refer people to echo housing. You've heard mentioned several times and other resources that are available to deal with fair housing and maintenance and other kinds of issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if it's not result at the rack, what happens?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is an opportunity for if the property owner or the tenant wants to pursue it, to come before the council and staff. Typically the recommendation is to ask council to write a letter to the property owner upholding the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The council typically votes to uphold the recommendation. A letter is sent and typically those that request to uphold the rack recommendation is not complied with. Because if it's going to be dealt with, it's going to be dealt with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, in our experience at the at the RAC or as Mr. Lindsay was just talking about the case that was just heard two weeks ago and following the meeting, the property owner reflected on the recommendations that were being suggested and subsequently decided that they made a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other question, maybe this is for Mr. Camera. You know, I see a lot of signs in here with some big numbers. You know, can you can you share with us how many tenants came to you throughout this process and said, my rents were increase like over 10%?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you elaborate on some of that? Was it three people? Was it ten people? Was it you know, so there were some serious challenges with just getting tenants to contact me. My name, phone number and email address were in the papers multiple times, and when I did get somebody that did actually call me, the very first'",
        "'speaker_0': 'thing that they said was, Can I be anonymous? How do I even get involved with this process? Because I am fearful of retaliation was the number one reason that people gave for not wanting to be involved. And I think that is part and parcel of a few, very, very few bad examples.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Benton being one of them, which was the very rare, I think, situation that the council had to deal with, except it also went everywhere. And so now that sends a message, I think, to tenants that if we don't have a process that's that is effective, then they don't have any recourse.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will I can guarantee you that was the issue that I had to face, which was why it was difficult to get people together. Fortunately, between MM Renter Renters Coalition and Renewed Hope, there was like a safety area where tenants could go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wasn't even invited to some of the meetings, but the information that came out of them then did come to me. So how many was there? Six over 10%. Was there five or 25% or was there three? I mean, how many people anonymously or that care to identify themselves?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for the people that came forward at the tenant meeting, there were probably maybe 12 to 14 that actually came and either spoke or sent emails in and their increases were in what was the average. And sometimes they didn't I don't have that statistical data and but I think if you look at the rack records for last'",
        "'speaker_0': 'year, that will give you some insight into that, some of the types of rent increases that tenants were facing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to move on if we can, and start calling on speakers, please. Thank you very much, David Perry. Then I'll be royal Robert. And then Eric Johnson. Thank you. And I really appreciate everyone being so patient.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and council staff. I'm David Perry. I'm the current chairperson of the RAC. This is Royal. Robert's, my colleague is also a member of the RAC. Debbie pretty much answered, you know, the question you had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We both we and staff thought it might be helpful if we gave a very brief overview of what the RAC is and what it does to give context to what is being presented by the task force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the only suggestion would be, please don't be redundant. I have a lot of other people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Consist of five members. We are not advocates. We all we all have a background in legal backgrounds or real estate backgrounds, background in landlord tenant law, a a passion for mediation. I think we all share that. We had, as was stated, we had spoken and given informational presentations at three of the public task force meetings at which'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we presented ideas we had batted around informally but had not, you know, drilled down into or made formal in any sense. Some of those ideas have been taken up by the task force. So in order not to be right, I won't be redundant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I will say that we do support the task force's request that the City Council direct staff to further evaluate those proposals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. One thing I would like to add and thank you for your time is the committee consists of of those five members, two of them are renters. Two of them are landlords and one is an independent homeowner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those aren't advocacy positions. Those are just to have the balance of the make up of the people that are on the committee anymore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One further face to this thing, something. I had a 20% rent increase a few months back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And sorry get you continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To give another face to this. I had a 20% increase a few months back and my landlords know I'm on the rack. So there you go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did not bring it before the rack.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Madam Mirror to indicate I've been in discussions with the city attorney about this matters as I do rent out rooms at my place helps pay the mortgage. I inquired as to whether that constitutes a conflict of interest to which the city attorney had indicated it does not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Given that this discussion is a discussion matter that will affect the public generally. So there is no specific effects, positive or negative to me. It's a fact that generally, which I am a member of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can share those comments later. Let's continue. The two gentlemen are finish. Thank you very much, Eric Johnson. And then Garfield can cross and then Doyle Saylor. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor Council Staff Good evening. My name is Eric Johnson and I've been a housing provider in Alameda for about 30 years. I hate to admit that, but I'm responsible for 366 apartment units from one end of the island to the other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're well-maintained. These are limited partnerships primarily. And so they have many owners. And so I'm a general partner and a managing general partner, and those owners are here in Alameda. And I think that's typical of the dispersion you see of of housing providers here in this town, which is unusual in my experience.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of ownership in in in the town. Here in the community. So one of the things I wanted to do is look back ten years and look at the end game on these 366 years. So you get a better picture than just the last 18 months of what's going on here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I went back and looked at 2004 income and compared it to 2013 and come see actual results or accounting is done outside by third party accounting. DCH Phillips City, a well-known accounting firm. They do the bookkeeping, too, which is unusual.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So these numbers are our numbers that I don't have any control over. From 2004 to 2013, we saw a steady and typical fall in the purchasing power of the dollar. So we saw the dollar fall 23.3% in terms of purchasing power.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're well aware of that. Doing your budgets, that affects us. Very starkly as well. So in order for the rents to cover the property's expenses rising at this rate over these ten years, nominal rents would need to be 23% higher ten years later, just to stay even.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, in theory now our taxes went up higher than that. Water bills went up higher than what's, let's call CPI, a nominal benchmark. So collected income for these 366 units overall has gone up 27% in that time period, barely above the 23% of the CPI.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when corrected for actual dollars after subtracting from inflation and I realize this renters look at it effective real rise was about 4%. Over those ten years, 4% over ten years, so point 4% annually over those ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's what the rental markets look like to people like me that are trying to do the seismic work, repair the sidewalks that we now have to pay for, that the city no longer pays for fix earthquake damage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It it seemingly never happens. We've adopted the international building code for roofs, so no more flat roofs. We have to pitch our roofs. If we replace roofs, that's going to double the cost. So all of this makes it very difficult to maintain sustainable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what I'd like you to think about when you think about apartments and in your town, do you want sustainable housing? This stuff is old. It's 50 to 70 years old. It's costing more and more to maintain. My thanks to Jeff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I told him this was going to be like herding cats, you know?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ex Speaker Ross Garfield. Ken Cross.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello, Mayor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And City staff and city council members. My name is Garfield Cairncross. I've been in Alameda since the base was open. I worked there ten years. I transferred to the United States Mint in San Francisco as a civilian metal finisher.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm a federal employee. 30 years. I saw lots of retirement. A ceremony today. And, you know, I'm beginning to wonder if I'm going to be able to retire because of these incremental rent increases that I've received over the past three years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a trend of. Receiving 10% increase as the flat rate. Whenever there's a market surge, this becomes an issue here. From what I understand, the RAC was able to provide a one year stay on rent increases after I had received a 20% rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I didn't know about the rack. And I found out about it through a very ambitious, uh, proactive renter in my complex. About 30 of us showed up that night, and then a rent crisis was publicized. That's what the term was in the press.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, I'm just wondering, you know, is is it going to keep going up? You know, do I have to live in, you know, some small space and pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just as much or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More and sacrifice, you know, my health needs. You know, I have to pay for transportation, you know, and. I just don't know what's going to happen next. But I feel a little a little safer now that this study has has been put forward and is in the process of evaluation by.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope that it becomes in the process of evaluation by this committee or excuse me, by the city council. And I can say that I'm very thankful for for having the opportunity to to to stand before you and ask for the implementation of these six measures that were brought together after this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Merging of tenants and landlords. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Doyle. Sailor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madame Mayor, I want me to city council members. My name is Doyle Saylor, and I'm a Alameda renter. The media likes to tell us the San Francisco Tech workers are pushing up rents, trying to take advantage of lower Alameda rents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I dispute this claim. The National Association of Realtors figures for the year November 2013 to November 2014 for the San Francisco Bay Area. Housing unit sales declined by 20%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the prices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Went up by 27%. That price rise and housing is not tech workers putting pressure on existing sales. It is speculators pushing prices up as sales decline. Recognizing house flipping is coming to a halt. The same speculative groups have switched their recently purchased stocks to rental income and similarly set prices higher.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Additionally, informal interviews with individual property managers report as much as 20% of rental units they manage are being held off market to further enhance price gouging. It is speculators, not tenants, raising rents sky.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'High. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Jason Buckley. And then Jon Sullivan and then Ken Laban.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello, Mayor. And Council and staff. You've got me way past my bedtime, so I may be a little cranky, but, boy, a couple of things I wanted to address. One is that, I mean, even with the fact we're looking at 10% increases, which for struggling families whose income is probably pretty stagnant, that's that's a lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The whole process has kind of been a little frustrating as the Iraq. Really has no teeth. And I don't know what the solution would be, but I mean, I would like to see the RAC get a little bit more reformed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to see it maybe have some kind of enforcement. Yeah. I'm exhausted. I'm sorry. I'm done. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Mayor Spencer and members of the council. Members of the staff. I'm John Sullivan. And I've been. Operating. I'm an owner operator of 200 units here in Alameda for over four over the last 20 years, really back about 15 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we had a market, general market like we had no where the rents were going up. And I at that time representing the Rental Housing Association and CAA and some others got involved in getting together and getting a good rental mediation program going for different cities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'San Leandro, Alameda and the. The unincorporated area of Alameda County served three different jurisdictions through different programs. Really? So. So. Naturally, being involved with that stage event. Stayed involved and witnessed the negatives, the ups and the downs and so forth of the mediation programs, how they worked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they're all outlined really. They're all captured pretty much on that first document on the top of your your list there. So I would like if you would, you know, peruse through that. Now, today, I really feel we have an excellent opportunity to form a kind of a model mediation program here in Alameda, having the benefit of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'watching how these other programs work over the last 15 years or so. As you know, as long as we learn from it and make appropriate adjustments to suit, you know, our situation and so forth, and a little back up material that would be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And next, I guess behind your program, they're behind your the initial one. And this would be. We had, you know, we always have the question of why. Why can't we, you know, give 2%, 3%, 4%, whatever every year?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it's not possible. And the reason the market really dictates that and this what this came from, not me, from another landlord who wanted to show the fact that there's many years, many years when there's no possibility of giving a rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it shows that in some of these there if you want to browse through them and and it shows the average rent increase over year 15 and to a ten, ten year period. And they're anywhere from a look here for 3.9 to 2.43 and before this bring it out on an annual basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the fact is we have to. To really acknowledge the fact that we there will be highs and lows. So the tenant does benefit one day when they're in the low times. Now, one other item that we haven't really one other item that we haven't really addressed, and that is that there are the extraordinary increases of 15%'",
        "'speaker_3': ', 20%, 30%. And that happens when an A sale, generally of sale, a piece of property. I really feel any good mediation program should address that. And that's something we should look into and. A few other items and I'll just finish up and there are two other attachments there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of them is a caution racing wrench in today's market. That's something that we as landlords put out, distributor members cautioning against and, you know, excessive raises, obviously, and trying to smooth out. So it'll make it at least as palatable as possible to a tenant.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so and I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak on this. I hope you would, you know, seriously, take a look and consider these items that I have presenting to you and then. Obviously I would be available going forward to, you know, to put any finishing touches to this program that we're you know, we're all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'into it together. I'd been at a lot of those meetings and talked to different people, and I'm sure we could still work together with, you know, Angela, Jeff and Don and so forth, and that I hope the loose ends and come up with a good program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Ken.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Mayor. Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Ken Godliman. I'm a resident here in Alameda. And I would like to thank Jeff for doing such a beautiful job. Thank you, Jeff. It really helped. Bring people together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a contractor here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I retrofitted and replaced foundations by the hundreds. And I can tell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You that in the last.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ten, 15 years, the cost for that project. Has doubled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Retrofitting a home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And putting new foundation in. Is it safe for our community and it's safe for the inhabitants who live in it. I'm afraid that if there's any kind of a rent control or a freeze on price, it will. The.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Devastating for our community. It actually keeps the homes and our community from being safe. And that's where it's at. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Bruce Carnes, then Barbara Rasmussen and then Ed Hirshberg.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor Council. I'm a small landlord and I have two Victorians who are terribly expensive to maintain and I've kept my rents down where they're not anywhere near market. And a lot of my friends are this way. And I think that introducing something new, I think the peer pressure is probably the best way to go about this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all of us, lots and lots of small landlords, we live right here in Alameda. And so we're we're affected by the city. We love the city. And that's what I have to say. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Council members. Staff. My name is Barbara Rasmussen. I've lived in Alameda for quite a long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been a housing provider for about 20 years. I want to thank Jeff for the work he's done and say that I support the proposal that he has before you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hirshberg. I don't believe he must have left. Moving on then. Laura Thomas, Marjorie Roach and Angie Watson will be after. And then David Howard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and council members Laura Thomas from Renewed Hope. First off, I wanted to give you copies of our rent survey updated because I gave you copies back in July. And about 40 more people reached our online survey and answered it in the meantime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can't say that the results are random because they're self-selected. They're people that, you know, heard about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Found their way to our Google.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Site and filled it out. But what I think since there's three of you that weren't on the council six months ago, I thought it would be good to bring an update. So some of the first responders responded back at the beginning of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so there's 40 new ones. But I think what you might find really enlightening and useful is the 180 comments that are attached. So everybody that responded to the survey had an opportunity to post a comment and we collected them all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that will be, you know, I think, help quite a bit in understanding some of the anxiety people are feeling. So renewed. Hope greeted the suggestion of that city task force back in September with a certain amount of skepticism because it didn't include tenant representatives.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we also responded to the desires voiced at the time by both the organizing committee of renters that we had convened, and the landlords and property managers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wanted to engage in a discussion of the issues and the problems surrounding rent increases. And we chose this alternative because we hope to bridge the divide and we hope to find common ground. As you know, the progress, I think, was kind of difficult and it underlined the disparity in power between the two groups in particular, because it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was very hard for us to get tenants to come. And we ended up with a kind of a small core group that was. Brave enough to just sit down throughout the whole process. But what emerged in the meantime was something that we had hoped for, which was the tenant led group, the Alameda Renters Coalition, whose intent is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to continue working with property managers to strengthen the Rent Review Advisory Committee and to continue to organize and support renters in Alameda. We aren't going to ask that for the task force to be convened at this point. We will be throwing our support behind the coalition has it takes the lead in organizing tenants.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we'll hope we'll all be working together to bring stable and affordable housing. De Almeida In pushing for the rent stabilization process to be included in the element, I reminded the Council that part of housing element law requires the city to conserve and improve the condition of existing affordable housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that means market rate rentals. You are the only ones that can say that the half of Alameda that is renting can turn to to deal with these economic forces that are assaulting them. And I hope you can develop the proper policies that recognizes the value of our community's social and emotional health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope you will give.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Solutions to these destabilizing housing costs your highest priority. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next was Marjorie and Angie from Echo. Are they?'",

Our purpose is to ensure that all renters have access to fair housing regardless of race, gender, national origin, disability, familial or marital status or sexual orientation or identity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As tenant landlord counselors, we are not advocates for either the renter or the housing provider. We advocate for the law to make sure that tenants and landlords are aware of the rights and responsibilities. When I reviewed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Take anywhere from.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An hour to several hours, depending on the complexity of the issues. I have another issue that concerned me with regard to the report that Mr. Camber wrote. Tenants were reluctant to come forward to complain about rent increases because of fear of reprisals or retaliation by housing providers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want every.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. David Howard and Dennis Cox and Andrew Barr leaving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mayor and council and staff members. I'm an Alameda resident and since 1985 have been either a commercial real estate appraiser or a chief underwriter for affordable housing developed development. A lender. My position is that the evidence is pretty strong, that rent control is a right a solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been tried and failed in virtually every case. The main problem with rent control is that there's no means test. So whoever's in there, it's subsidized. And what turns out to be the case is you're more likely to subsidize an investment banker than somebody who needs to be subsidized.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For example, I'll be appraising a property tomorrow. That has a stockbroker in the penthouse. At less than 50% of market rent. Running his stock brokerage business. Out with a wide bank of screens. And so this is what happens with rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another unintended consequence would be my family moved to Alameda in the beginning of 2000. We lived next door to a blighted property that was, I think, nine units. The building was built in 18. 90, approximately. So this building would be subject to rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would have never been renovated. It was a vector problem up until a year and a half ago when the rents got strong enough. This what was really looked like the Addams Family house finally got renovated. And then the last thing I would point out from my experience to two things actually in appraisal work is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When there's an apartment complex that's in a lesser neighborhood, those units will never get renovated, that they will be as bad as can possibly be and be inhabitable. So that's one unintended consequence. The other one is this only protects the people who are there right now because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Once somebody moves out and rent controls in place, the landlord will charge the highest possible rent. That is achievable. First of all, there will be very few units because people don't leave rent controlled units. So vacancy goes way down, which will drive the rent up on the remaining units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the consequences? It's an idea. It seems like it would work, but because mainly because there is no means testing, you get all these bizarre consequences and it affects the upkeep of the properties also. And then finally, new people who want to move in here, no matter how poor they might be, they're out of luck.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cox. Hey. Of our 11. Rashid Shabazz, Don Spangler. That's our order. Thank you. As far as I know, Dennis Cox is not here. All right. Oh. Okay. The end of our living.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council and staff. My battery is almost out, so I'm glad I was called.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm speaking this evening as the immediate past president of the Alameda Association of Realtors. Our current president, Tony Berg, was unable to attend. So I'm speaking on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'His behalf for our board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Alameda Association of Realtors is an organization whose members represent both renters and housing providers. We provided information as requested by the facilitator and only attended those meetings where all parties were invited.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've read the report and we believe the report does not respond to the direction of the city council. The Council has the group to provide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Regarding the depth of the problem, as well as.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Demographic information, including the number and type of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rental units available in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Median rent for each type of unit and average vacancy rates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What we feel the report does not address the request of the Council. We do feel that it fairly highlights.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The rent review advisory committee. The good work that it does and the need to increase the committee's role in this process. The LME, the Association of Realtors, stands ready to be active in any further committees or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Assistance as needed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Rashid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good afternoon or good evening. It is late, like another speaker said and past my bedtime. Council. City staff. Beautiful people of Alameda. My name is Rashid Shabazz and I moved to Alameda in 1987. I moved here along with my mother, the beautiful, intelligent Deborah James or Deborah James.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we moved to a shelter on Concordia Street, which was near what used to be the liquor bar and later Rite Aid and now I think is Westbury. We were able to later move to a one bedroom apartment over on Central, above what's called a Taco Bell here across from what used to be Taco Bell and Elmo'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mike's. And we later moved in 1989 to what was then the point of Vista Apartments and later Bridgeport. Now, we were able to move into that apartment complex because there had been a situation similar to what we've seen here, where rents were raised double, doubled in many instances, or threatened to be doubled by a property owner, Gersten'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Company out of L.A. and people came to the city council meeting, protested and ultimately Section eight vouchers were issued and me and my mother was for the move into the Harbor Island apartments or again it was the post office departments that are Bridgeport Apartments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And many people know the story that in 1996, the 15 group, the Florida Slumlords, bought those apartments and renamed it the Harbor Island Apartments. For about eight years, this out-of-state landlord allowed the apartments to deteriorate. There was a Harbor Island task force in which no residents were involved, and this task force and the city allowed them to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'continue to operate without forcing enforcing any of the code violations, the multiple.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Code violations that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Existed. I give some of that history because that was my own experience. And then ultimately in 2004, me, my mother and 400 other families were forced from the Harbor Island Apartments. We know from the USDA or the school district data that nearly two thirds of families were forced from the island because so many children were then placed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'out of district. So the experience of residential displacement is something I know personally. Our family moved twice after that, and we've been in the same apartment for the last nine years. And fortunately, our landlord, who used to live in that apartment as a resident and now owns it, has not raised our rent for nine years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are very grateful. That is not a reality for most out of meetings, I'm sure don't have any scientific evidence, but I doubt that the euphemistically speaking housing providers or landlords are able to extend that to everybody. I later with that housing stability was able to go back to school, went to UC Berkeley.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did my housing, my undergrad thesis on. And if I can just wrap up very, very briefly, I did my thesis on housing discrimination against Alameda in black Alameda and it's called Alameda and is our home. And one of the takeaways from that is that this displacement is constant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's particularly for African-Americans. And so while I spoke out here in September in favor of a task force, I repeat that there needs to be a task force to be able to study this data. I'm grateful for the community process that did exist because it organized people and attempts to engage people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm interested in data. I think that what was proposed, although we had critiques, there were no residents represented by the stakeholders or not residents pardon me, there were not any renters representing I don't know if there is any renters represented on this council or the previous council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that doesn't necessarily mean that it is invalid, right? Because if that was the case, then with the housing tenure in Alameda, half of the folks should be renters. Right. So anyway, in conclusion, since you allow me two little extra time to speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm grateful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For that, I would again hope that we can bring up the housing task force to be able to study and get more information about the actual renter market. What is the state of the market? What are some of the demographics of the housing tenure where people being displaced?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does that impact things like the school district, etc.? Because housing is a basis for many other opportunities that us Al-Amin are grateful for. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. The John Spangler and I'll Brian McGuire. And then, Amy, we thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you again, Mayor Spencer. I'll be brief because my line is going off in 5 hours. I've been at it since five. I want to offer start, sir, with a quote from Martin, the Reverend Martin Luther King. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When we first moved to Alameda in 1997, we bought a house. Linda and I owned the house for about 12 years. We sell it. So since then, we've been since 2009, we've been renting. There is a profound difference in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The potential for intimidation when you're renting than when you're dealing with a mortgage. The comments that Jeff quoted and others have referred to are genuine. They're very real. And I'll bet you none of them. None of those comments came from investment bankers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been to three Alameda Renters Coalition meetings. None of the people who shown up have said anything about being in the banking business, never mind being investment bankers. A lot of these people are on fixed incomes. Social Security retirement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when they're faced on a fixed income with a 10% increase. That means they get to choose when they're going to eat or whether they don't get medication anymore. Instead of paying the rent increase. This is a very real conflict.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The landlords you've heard from tonight have very real expenses. I've heard a great deal. I've seen a great deal of can they live and work on foundations? I know what the going market rate was when we were on the gold in the Gold Coast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those are real expenses. I don't want any landlords to starve either, but I don't think it's fair that people who are faced with a 30% no ifs, no ads, no buts increase without any changes at all in the status of the apartment they're living in and no change in ownership and no improvements and substandard conditions should get'",
        "'speaker_0': 'away with that. That said, I support the process that Jeff undertook. I am very happy to be part of the group that is now offering some support to my fellow renters. And I hope to God that this mediation process and strengthening the RAC works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is the Alameda way. It would be wonderful to not pursue stronger measures. But. If this collaborative approach does not work, we have a big problem on our hands and I hope this council will be willing and able and ready to deal with the next step if it has to come.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Good evening, Council Mayor Staff. I could stand up here and tell personal stories about rent increases past, present and future. Notice to vacate upcoming move from the only home my daughter's ever known. But I think some of that anecdotal grounds been well covered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council has a bigger responsibility than just dealing with this on a case by case basis. Renter initiated mediation is no substitute for an ordinance governing this relationship between renters and property owners. Smart people can and have already told you more about the types of power imbalances in this relationship.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing, renters hold almost zero market power over their housing costs in terms of choosing one versus another. They can't dictate to the property owner, so they can just act and choose off the menu. Think if you were a teacher or a cop and had to negotiate your pay and benefits instead of relying on collective bargaining.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Angela and Arc HRC have started this process, but you really are our union reps in this type of situation. You need to act accordingly. A lot of property owners have, you know, several property owners in this process and, you know, in the discussions have sort of been crying poor and talking about the costs of maintenance and keeping'",
        "'speaker_0': 'safe, habitable structures makes it sound like property owning property in Alameda is undesirable. But look at the MLS right now and you can see there's almost zero multifamily rental properties on the market right now available for purchase. If they don't want to be property owners and landlords and it's too much of a hassle, there's a line of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'people that will be happy to pay double what they inherited, double the value that they inherited, that their parents paid for when they, you know, and that they've now inherited and are are making their living off of. They'll be alright by the grace of God.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think they'll make it. I don't personally advocate for the strictest rent control measures due to some well-documented unintended consequences, but you need to take some of the volatility out of this process. Something like CPI plus X percentage with the ability for capital pass thrus is could be a starting point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's lots of you know, we can learn from other cities. This process needs to have the city's imprimatur behind it. I was disappointed that the previous council kind of pass the buck on this. And I hope you. Consider this and actually work on an actual ordinance and not just rely on a case by case process to try'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to negotiate this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What was your name again?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Brian McGuire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Good evening, everyone. My name is Amy. I'm a renter. I live in Alameda about eight years. And this few years, you know, I'm a renter, a race two times totally about $300. And I enjoying the meeting like a renter meeting staff about six times.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I listen to every people and less than the owner what's reason they entrees rent binary also I ask my friends they are owner you know and then. For me. I know. You know, you're only the owner. They cost the same, you know, and I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And no reason to raise the rent. And for me, I think you only raise the one times enough. I don't. I want. Don't want. I hope it can stop no normal or raise the rent or you know, for me, I think I or I want to rent a house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a renter's lease, you know it just how much money pay, you know that's how much money. You know it is a Y raise next time. And also I hear my friends, he's a renter, a owner. He said, oh, Amy, I will go to raise my raise their house, rent of money as they I say how'",
        "'speaker_1': 'much money. They say, oh, 100. I say to you know, oh, what's, you know how they think, how they say, I don't know, you know and I know about they they know why is retired one woman another is a picket dog or stuff a woman I feel you know also care about their you know is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My friends, he's the owner, but he's he, you know, have money. You know, he don't want any money. That's the he just think, you know, see another place how much money or to bail on so I thought well going to so for this is all stories I felt no I hope you know is the city council and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a study about that you know. And. If I want to raise money, you know, maybe 2%. And from, you know, just a sink of 2%. I know I've already raised money too much, you know. Only one times. I know, actually, you know, is no reason to raise rent.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I hope kids think about this. You know, I have good stages and as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank thank you. Count that. That was our last speaker everyone. So at this point council comments are actually staff do you want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Cause.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I guess what Steph is looking for tonight, you've heard a great deal of testimony. I think on behalf of Steph, I want to thank Jeff Canberra for putting together this process with the stakeholders now that they've put forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their product we had staff really need direction from the council because this is such a. It's a very human issue, but it's also, from a policy perspective, a very complex issue. There's lots of different ways of looking at data, what data is being considered and not being considered and the way that gets framed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can determine the outcome. So what data is being collected and analyzed, I believe, is actually in itself a policy decision because we don't have unlimited resources either financially or in terms of staff time. So what I'm hope what what on behalf of staff who are going to actually do the work, what we're looking for is some clear'",
        "'speaker_0': 'direction and boundaries from the Council about what it is you're looking for us to do here. And then we'll be able to give you a report back on how long that will take. I'll need to think about it for a week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like how long will it take to put together what you're asking for? But we do need clear direction from the Council. On next steps, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm willing to jump in. All right. Council members. Who would actually you want me to now? Obviously would like to start. Is anyone else?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys go to that? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead. Thank you, Mary Spencer. So and it's been said, but thank you to Mr. Cameron, Mr. Lindsay, Angela and all the other people, all the speakers. Very informative. We appreciate it. I am. And it was said by a couple of speakers and I appreciate everything that was done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm really impressed whenever a community group coming from such divergent viewpoints can get together and find middle ground and, you know, not be at each other's throats. I think you did a good job and I think you may be surprised each other with some of the things you found out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I went back, though, and read the the staff report from September when the staff report was recommended, but the majority of the council chose not to do it. And that's that's fine. I think this has been a valuable process, but I am still concerned that we need I believe we need to answer some of the questions that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'were posed by that staff report before we move move further. These might be great proposals, the 5 to 6 points. But what was asked in in Ms.. Porter went over them in the beginning is the questions that a task force would have been asked to answer was, is what is the state of the residential rental market in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda? And I appreciate everything the the community groups did, but I don't think they had the resources or the time or the wherewithal to answer that question. I think there's been some interesting data presented in one of the online news sources, Michelle Allison, at the Alameda meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I know staff is proposing a consultant to gather that sort of data. I feel like we need to know that to have that answered because it was to know what the impacts of tenants of rental increases are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trends impacts on residents and families, identifying the root causes for recent price increases, existing efforts in other Bay Area cities to combat these increases, and also how these increases impacted different groups, whether it was by age or by racial group or the type of housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we need to know more of that. As far as what have been the impacts of rent control or stabilization ordinances in jurisdictions that adopted them? You know, of all the speakers we heard only a couple and I think there were landlords even touched on rent control and why that wouldn't be a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that might be premature, quite premature this time. But I do think the question and it was answered in part by the group, what changes, if any, should be made to the R, a c? One thing that I found, I think in investigating a little bit is that in the RC works hard when they get these cases'",
        "'speaker_2': ', I don't think it's the same sort of process for joining that board as other boards and commissions, because as I understand it, there's no term limit. So we can look at that tomorrow and. Okay, yes, good. Yes, we're looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the so we haven't had a study done. I think that I would want to wait to even explore these proposals and whether they should be adopted until we know a little bit more about what the situation is that we're facing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think Councilmember Odie tried to elicit that, that, you know, how many ranchers did you hear from? And I'm still troubled by the fact that we're hearing that some people were hesitant to even be heard. So, I mean, there must be some other ways besides coming forward in a in a public forum.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But anyway, those are some of my thoughts at this late hour. And if people want to discuss the specific proposals, I'll come back. But I just feel like we need more data. Okay. And I want to say so the people that are watching us when they watch us on feet, again, it is approximately 15 minutes after midnight'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I know everyone wanted to take on the whole agenda tonight and I'm pretty sure we will not be doing that. So at this point. Member Comments. Next. Next. Council Member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Want to go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll try to pick. And I'll try to cover like general comments on on the issue of rent control and then specifics on the six items. I do want to say thank you to Mr. Camera and the group. I was one of those people that was skeptical in the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thought that the both the referral process, the referral that the staff came up with was the way to go. But I'm heartened by the fact that you guys have tenants and property owners talking together and collaborating and working together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we did have that six months. And I think we have a path forward with this group, you know, to form the foundation for, I guess what was called a model mediation process. So I'm encouraged by that and I hope we can keep moving forward on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I hope that Mr. Lindsay can continue to be the enforcer and keep keep the bad apples in line. But I you know, there's one thing we're talking about Alameda Point tonight and, you know, there's a connection between, you know, the housing stock shortage and rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we're going to sit up here and say, well, we don't believe we should have rent control, and at the same time sit up here and say we should also stop building housing. We should have no housing at the point we should have moratoriums, you know, on density bonus applications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I don't think we can do that. You know, otherwise we're going to end up having a city that's full of tech people that's going to shut out. You know, people like myself, I'm a tenant. One of the people asked, are there tenants?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's two tenants up here that if the other one wants to say who they are, they can do that. But, you know, I'm a tenant and. If that's what the city wants, then, you know, I guess I'll be for it because that's what the will of the people is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't think we want to turn into downtown San Francisco or South a market where we're the only people that can afford to live here, you know, are people that work in the tech industry. So I do want to just second a little bit of what Councilmember Ashcraft said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's no one short term objective that I like to see, and that's this collection of data. I believe that was the first item on the original staff report State of the residential market, quantitative analysis of rental rates, vacancy rates, and so on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I think maybe as a long term, because I don't think we can make a decision on if we're going to implement rent control or if rent control is even necessary until we have that data. So maybe a longer term, it could be six months, it could be eight months, it could be however long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Staff recommends we need to have an adequate amount of data to make that decision. Then we have an analysis of rent control as a tool to maintain stable rents and affordable housing. And. I was a landlord tenant attorney before going into government service.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the thing that I saw in my practice is that. Rent control didn't really help anyone except the attorneys. So if we're going to do something, it has to be something that protects our tenants. It has to be something that, you know, respects the rights of property owners to protect themselves from the rate of inflation and earn'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a reasonable rate of return. Because actually this is an investment for them, but it cannot be a full employment act for attorneys. So we have to be careful as we put that together. I think the other thing that we haven't looked at and I didn't see it in here, I think some of the tenants mentioned it, some'",
        "'speaker_0': 'type of just cause eviction. You know, there's no there was no discussion on that. I mean, can you pick somebody who's been there for 15 years and then re rent it out at market rents? So I think that's something that we need to look at as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So just quickly going over the six points. You know. Again. Jeff, I think you guys did a great job of putting this together. And, you know, I'm impressed with the way you're able to bring people together. And I hope we can we can push forward these six points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just have a couple quick comments on one discussion. Point one I think we should consider that is parties only, not attorneys. You guys have developed a rapport between landlords and tenants, and I think it's better if in the mediation process, you know, it's still the landlord and the tenant and not not attorneys going at it'",
        "'speaker_0': '. A discussion point to participation. You know, there might be I agree with that recommendation, but I think there might be a valid reason why someone may need a continuance. Maybe they're out of town, maybe, you know, they have childcare issues, you know, in building some mechanism where they can do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then if the, you know, if the landlord wants a continuance, then, you know, he or she doesn't get their rent increase for that time period where they have that continuance. Discussion point three. You know, I think it's very important that we have this notice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, one of the things I've I've heard is there wasn't a lot of tenant representation there, a lot of tenants. And I found this in my practice. A lot of tenants don't know their rights. So, you know, giving something, making it a requirement as when you get a lease that you get some notice that says, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know, we have this rec and we have this process and if you have a rent increase in the future, you have a remedy if you think it's excessive. And I agree that, you know, every time you get a rent increase, this should be a required notice that that's served with every rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to skip 2.6 because that's kind of melded into 2.3. But this this percentage, I think we have to be very careful if we set a percentage because we're basically saying if you if you say anything over 10% has to go to the rack, then you're basically saying anything 9.9% or 9.99% or under is going'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to be acceptable and there's going to be no recourse. And I encouraged by my discussion with Mr. Lindsay also earlier today that you guys are talking about this. The task force is is trying to come up with a number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we have to be careful. You know, right now we have no number. We don't want to be in a situation where we're having de minimis rent increases. You know, going to the rack. So I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we also want to make sure that, you know, we're not giving license to say, you know, anything under a certain number, you know, is not going to have any review on the retaliation. The point was made, you know, this is the law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, that's in the civil code. I don't know if we need a new ordinance to say you're not allowed to retaliate if it's already state law. But I think if we put that in the notice or we put something in there that says, you know, exercising your rights to mediation under the act is not or is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actually considered an exercise of tenant rights and cannot be retaliated. And I think that would be sufficient. And then on point five. I agree with that one. And then I think I discuss point six. So again, I want to thank all the folks here that came out and talked.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have an appreciation for all the tenants. Being a tenant myself, I appreciate for the tenants as someone who fought for tenants. I will say I never had a tenant case in Alameda, so I think our landlords are doing a good job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think that we have a widespread issue of exorbitant rents, but I really would like to see the data and that's my suggestion and a thanks everyone and thank you Jeff for for all your hard work on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member de sac.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you Mayor Spencer for a purpose of tonight. One of the things I wanted to do was review a range of data, largely because that was one of the issues that we had raised way back in November when City Council then discussed how we might approach this matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I put together a data table, a presentation, there are just six tables in and the presentation, but I just really want to focus our attention on three of the tables and for what the presentation is about is about, you know, what has been the experience of oh.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You want to do this? And then I'll just. What has been the experience of rental households in the city of Alameda? I made comparisons with San Leandro and the city of Oakland as well as Alameda County. But for our purposes tonight, we're just going to focus our discussion on the city of Alameda and perhaps on the website'",
        "'speaker_4': '. On our website, I'll post further discussions about comparisons. If we can go to table one. We'll just skip the objectives right here. This is a key table because the data comes from the United States Census American Community Survey, which is a survey of a sample of residents in the city of Alameda over a number of years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you can see the way that I prepare the data. I look at pre-recession recession and recovery period. Let's just focus on the recovery period. According to the eight U.S. Census acts, the typical health rental household pays 29.4% of their income towards their rent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the reason why that number is important is because 30% is the threshold for what constitutes affordable housing. Now, bear in mind, this is from samples from the 2011, 2013 period. These could have just jumped way off the charts in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when you look at the typical that is the median household who rents, they're paying 29.4% of their rent of their income towards rent. So they're just slightly under what the Fed constitutes as unaffordable, which is 30% is the threshold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next slide. And this is a comparison with other cities, but we're going to skip on table three. I think this this really gets to one of the reasons why we're dealing with with the stresses that we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even though the typical rental household pays slightly under the affordable rate, the typical rental household income is $51,700 in Alameda. Relative to the typical household owner occupied household income, which is $113,300. So someone mentioned, for example, that they experienced rents of $450 increase for $50 a month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So multiply that by 12, that's $5,400. So you can imagine 12 times 20, 50 plus 5400. So you can imagine monthly, you know, when you annualize the monthly rent increase for renters, how that really draws down on on persons is constrained incomes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the important part about looking at the 51,700 is when you look at table for next table. Now, this table comes from an Oakland based outfit that talks about, you know, what is the income that's necessary to lead self-sufficient lives.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in this in Alameda County, if you have one if you're one adult with one child under under five years old, you need $55,700 to eat to lead a self-sufficient life. And that's you know, that's a bare bones income to, you know, that all the frills are not included.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Likewise, if you're a single adult with two children in those ages, a roughly $66,300 to who lead what's called what this outfit calls a self-sufficient lives. So you can see that when you look at the typical rental households income in Alameda of $51,700 and compare it against standards like the self-sufficiency standards, that kind of underscores even more'",
        "'speaker_4': 'how just, you know, slight change in in the rental in the rent upwards as affects disproportionately disproportionately affects renters. So let's go to the next slide. And the other thing, too, is, prior to the recession rent renters in Alameda, the typical renter had $59,700.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was a household income. And then coming out of the recession, the typical household is now as their income has declined by almost $8,000. So you can see that, you know, the rental housing market and the households in it, that there there are special constraints that we need to be cognizant of for the typical renter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the thing that I get out of this data is that. The typical renter, for the most part, has an affordable rent. But you can't just look at that affordable rent just because it's 29 under 30%. Rent to income ratio, just because it's under what the feds constitute as affordable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can't say, oh, well, you know, we don't have to do anything because you have to look at not just the rents, but you have to look at their income relative to, you know, what it takes to lead a self-sufficient life in in Alameda County.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also, you have to look at the income in terms of how it's changed in the past six years or so. And so I think what this tells me then is that while the data doesn't speak to any grounds for a generalized approach for dealing with the with a rent issue, generalized approach, meaning rent control, however defined'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and loosely defined as price controls. I don't think that those data from the households perspective to justify rent control from a generalized perspective. But I think there is enough there to to say that, you know, we do need very particular case by case type of solutions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think to me, this data speaks to I actually I think it confirms the six points that were raised through the forum. I still believe that the forum should take those six points and have them vetted more by the Rent Review Advisory Board, but as well as a social service human relations board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I will say, though, that the six points, in my opinion, need to be strengthened. I think that, for example, if we're going to make the changes that we're contemplating with regard to strengthened rent review advisory board in the relationship with equal housing, that implies that there's going to be a lot more cases involved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is ECHO or is the rent review advisory board, do they have the capacity to handle the rising expectations that we're creating in doing this? So I think we have to have to strengthen either echo housing our relationship with them or the review when fires report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One specific way of strengthening the rent review advisory board or the echo housing is. We've got the business license fee, you know, property rental property holders of a particular type, hey, into the into the fee. So what we could do is we're always adjusting the fee, you know, for, for, for purposes of inflation or maybe we hadn't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'adjusted it for for two or three years or so. So, you know, let's just say hypothetically, the fee is $110 or for the for property owners, the business license fee. And independent of this whole matter, we're going to adjust it anyways and we adjust it, let's say, to $125.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what I would propose is we take that increment and we reserve the increment for housing related issues. So and that and so if it's a $10, a $10 incremental change that that we would have made anyways regardless of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But now we're reserving that $10 incremental change. You know, you multiply that $10 times roughly 55,000 buildings that that contain 15,000 rental households, that $10 amounts to ten times 5000, which is what it's $50,000 for. Suddenly, you know, without having added on a new special fee, we would have come up with an amount of money that we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can help pay eco housing or rent, rent, review and value board, be able to handle the increased case that's going to come down the pike. And I think it's important to increase the capacity of echo housing is because last year in our Cdhb budget process, we actually took money out of eco housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, it was a interesting discussion that we had, but we ended up taking money out of Eko Housing. But city manager John Russo found ways to backfill that money. So, so, but but the issue though, is the way that we're funding our portion of Eko housing right now, it's, you know, it's subject to the budgetary, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, things. I think we should continue to fund them via CDBG, but we should also take a look at this kind of approach that I'm talking about with regard to the business license fee when it comes to rental property houses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, another specific item to improve the capacity of of of the rent review advisory board or eco housing. I, for example, I believe I don't have to pay a business license fee, though. I live upstairs and I rent out the two houses downstairs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you look on Craigslist, you know, there's a lot of people, I'm sure, you know, homeowners who are, you know, helping make their mortgage payments, you know, things like that. Well, I think, you know, rent review advisory board, it would be it would be great for them to, you know, to to look at to help us in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'under in looking at this issue with regard to that particular change that that we might contemplate. So that's that's another way that we might want to take a look at that. Oh, okay. So I do think that we're on the right track.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do think that there are substantive decision points that we can take to strengthen the six points that were were raised. So that and I do think that we can do it in a way that the property residential rental property owners, you know, if they were concerned about an increase in tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The way that I outlined it well, it increased anyways, but now we're just reserving the increment towards this issue. Like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd also like to echo, thanks to Mr. Canberra and everybody who stepped forward, participate. It's not been easy and. To see the five points to have consensus of. And the six point that is still being worked on, I think, is I'd like to seize the moment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And City Manager Russo asked for some specific direction, and I'd like to. Make a motion to have a staff of bring back an implementation plan for applying those principles to the Review Advisory Board. Because that first part is protecting and, and, and establishing fairness in dealings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a mediation process. It makes it stronger. It doesn't substantially change the process except to strengthen it. So I think that we have to we have to take advantage of the hard work that was done and move forward on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there are questions that were asked in the staff report of a September that haven't been answered and the data necessary to answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before you continue. If I heard correctly, you're making a motion. Yes, I will second that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I wanted to add or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Continue. Now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second part of the motion is to have staff gather the necessary data to answer the questions. It were posed in the. September report. And to use the resources that are. Out here in the coalition, as well as the housing provider group to help gather that information, because that's a group that didn't exist when this was was'",
        "'speaker_0': 'posed. So that's my motion is to do both.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I shouldn't. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to make sure the motion is. Is that. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I'm not going to stick it out. Someone else wants me. That's what we're looking for right now. So that we can continue the discussion. Yes. Okay. I'll second. And I would like to and I agree. No, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not for you to continue discussing. You've had no idea. I see. I know. Yeah, but that I haven't had an opportunity to speak at you. Comes back to you to finish up motion second. It comes back to you if you have any other comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I still have discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Then I get to speak because I've been waiting. You spoke at the beginning? No, but I said that I would if it was more than just a proposal to continue so we could study. They said I had some comments about the proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will get back, but everyone gets a turn. Then we can go round again. Okay. Thank you. That's fair. Okay. I am the other person that rents. I've been renting for 15 years. The same house when we first moved up here 15 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They were my husband and myself and four children. At that point, the renters market was such that we had to pay a fee to have someone help us find a home. However, it changed after that. Our rent decreased.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've actually had a very good relationship with our landlord, who is someone similar to some of the speakers we've had this evening and this. I know some of you have moved here in the last few years and you're experiencing this part of the renters market.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, over the 15 years that I've been renting here, it has gone down and it has now is going back up. And I do appreciate, as a renter not knowing for sure month to month what's going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I personally strongly support the first part of the motion because these are five things that we've had all these people spend all this time on, which started back in September, their house. And for me, I'm very concerned if we're going to have the spend, I don't know how much more time before other people are ready to support'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the work of the community here. I think it's very important we move along as quickly as possible. On your five points, on the five points that were unanimous, one through four, some of those are law. So there shouldn't be any problem with trying to get us to do those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eight out of nine, that's I don't expect to get better than that. I do think time is of the essence. And I understand I recognized back when this was sent by prior council to Geoff Cameron, it was to try to get people talking and trying to resolve this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They did their task and now it's our turn to actually take action on what the work that's already been done. So I do strongly support one through four and number five because that was it. They agree. It says no agreement on number six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would not have that hold up the process. I personally am in favor of 10% to me is too high. When your rents are 2000, 3000, whatever it is, 2500 10% is $200 on a $2,000 rent. And that I think many of us that are renting are paying close to the 2000 or actually higher than that at'",
        "'speaker_2': '$200 increase when it's handed to you actually works out to be 20 $400 a year. So for me, 10% is too high to restrict it to that I would entertain. I know there's people think that you need to have a percentage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really like the way you guys have all been working on this together, so I don't want to take anything away from this process. But for me, maybe 5%, just not that I'm saying that's the recommendation, but 5% if you're paying $2,100, that's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know. So for me, that's something to look at. But I would really hope that we could agree to take action on the five things and not complicate, which is why I'd like to break it down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the discussion. So I move that we make the five hour. Amend my motion, make the five consensus points. I'm back with an implementation plan in parallel with taking input from the working group as the recommendation comes back on the six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or consensus come back on the six or whatever it might be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we can have lots of promotions. But for this, I'd like a clean motion. One through five. Hand it to staff. Let them figure out how we can support the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Only to second vice mayor's motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that what that was, though?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it's just the five, for sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Six. Could we just do that part?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I don't want to hold up the train because people are working on that. Have them work on the sixth. If the staff report comes back and said there's no consensus, there's no consensus. We'll keep working on what we've got the five in the implementation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the five can move ahead without the six is my point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's okay. Okay. Five. Moving ahead without the six. But don't. But include it in there. So that is the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's other things we can include. But to make sure we're. I'd like to break it down so we can get our vote on what we can get. Then we can talk about the next thing. So. Okay. But there's a discussion before we vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did I get a second for that? Six. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So he has a second on that. So now if we could quickly discuss this motion because I want to get this through. Okay. I might ask you. Okay. So on discussion point too. I, I find the language about the tenets failure to appear unduly harsh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is what I mean. If you look at discussion point, too, we see that if the housing provider fails to appear or have a responsible party appear, although I think Vice Mayor would like it just to be the parties it was that, you know, no attorneys, just parties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's and I agree with that. That was councilmember member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree. I hold that thought. Okay. So that so if the the housing provider fails to appear, the rent increases is void. If the tenant, on the other hand, fails to appear, the committee will dismiss the case and the tenant will be barred from subsequently challenging such increase before the committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To my reading, that sounds like forever you can't come back. Whereas the landlord, all the landlord has to do is do another rent increase and show up this time and he or she is able to have the rent increase go through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I'm reading this correctly, I don't understand why we should subsequently bar a tenant from challenging such increase before the the committee. Or maybe it just means that particular increase. Okay. Okay. So not a future. Not a future bar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then in the text of the notice, the suggested text, I, I would like our city attorney's office to work on just making that language as user friendly as possible, because some of the folks who are dealing with these increases might English might not be their second language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We might think about what other languages it should be in. Other people are just challenged by legalese and this is better than some, but it could be better, I think just clearer. And the city attorney is nodding. She gets it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so then, okay, we're not we're not getting to the the percentage that triggers it. But that's the sort of thing I would probably like staff to study anyway. And then I would also suggest that staff talk with other cities who have these provisions in place to see what their experience has been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's no need to reinvent the wheel, and we might as well learn from others experiences. Maybe we could do this even better, but I think we are off to a good start. And then finally, should we as a council be asking for this matter to come back within a certain period of time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we just have a look at how it's how it's working out, how it's been playing out. Um, so before we go on to that, did you want to address this, this motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I did. But that's that was a question that you had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that was my last one. Should we just for council consider should we that that's separate that motion right now. So I'd rather.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Interpret it the motion what I'd like to see is a spell out range of possible implementations. I meant I specified two items that I would like, um, staff to take a look at because frankly, you know, if we don't improve the capacity of the review advisory board of Echo Housing to deal with a potential increase in, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, where we're probably in a worse situation, we've raised expectations, but we haven't improved the operations by which we're going to address those expectations. So I would like us to take a look at the business of those two business license item fees as part of the motion, so that there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Might be would be a separate and then I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do an amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So well, you know, one of the things, if I if I may respond to that is the we give staff direction to to come back with an implementation plan. My assumption is staff is going to refine these, not take verbatim and slap a cover sheet on it and give it to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's important to have your comment, um, be listened to by staff and incorporated into it is if it's going to be part of the implementation. Just like the point about item number six, is there a percentage there they may come back with saying, well, we could put 5%, but we advise that we don't put any'",
        "'speaker_0': 'percent because other cities don't have a threshold and the most democratic process allows anybody to challenge any increase. So I think that's the work that I expect staff to do. And I didn't purposely didn't put a due date on because I was going to wait for the manager's response to say, Well, we can do this in 60'",
        "'speaker_0': 'days or we can do 40 days. And then we would respond to that accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah. Oh. Well I said according to that fairly. If you want the answer. Now, I have to talk to Debbie for a minute. Let me. Let me talk. I don't want it. I purposely put it. Not in there to get your reaction after, should it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm hoping I'm hoping that we can agree here in a manner to support this community work. I actually am very concerned if we take if we if it's going to end, if we make it so complicated, it's going to take 60 days, 90 days to get stuff back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then it's going to be who knows how many more days before this happens. And this truly to me is a good faith effort. So I'm hoping we can come up with something that's not going to require.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The question that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I personally am not concerned about increase any license fee because I'll tell you, as any runner, I think most of us think when a fee gets passed on to the landlord, it's going to get passed on to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so for me, I would rather come up with a way that, as far as I know, is volunteers. We have many volunteers in this community that have already stepped up on this issue. And if there's a way I would rather put out the outreach of I need more volunteers to volunteer on rack rather than starting to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'increase fees that are going to be passed down. But isn't it isn't it fair to at least have staff look at overstocked, unwanted bonds and the suggestion that rate increases do not affect renters? They absolutely increase effect landlords and they affect renters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's something to keep in mind.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here's a question. Are we going to send this back not only to staff, but then the rent review advisory board for their view and input? Or are we sending it back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To give it back to us and then we'll make a decision?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would think that staff can communicate with them. The our direction is to staff. Um, so we have a motion on. You. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The answer is 90 days for publication and not for presentation because we have the two week agenda and we have to look at the data issue and what the data is going to cost and we want to be able to bring back to you and we may be able to do that more quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What the cost is to determine whether you want us to retain somebody to do that level of data collection. We'll move forward on the five points. There's no question that's easy. We can do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That. And so could you explain your comment? Because I want to I do want to address the five points. First, how much time do you need to do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': '90 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To do the five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Points, to do the five points and to work further with the community group that's already been established 90 days for publication. We'll have something published in that within 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when you come back to us in the meantime, then as part of that process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was not planning on doing that because then I have to we have to write another report and there's there's a limited resources. It's not this is not a huge staff. We will bring you something comprehensive back in 90 days and we will consult with the folks who were already the stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will come back to you before 90 days to let you know after we check with various. We don't want to just go to one consultant. We want to talk to a group of different consultants, and we will come back to you, even though it may be under the threshold number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll come back to you with a short report about this to collect data. This is what the proposals we got. What do you want to do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. What data are you talking about?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Collecting the data that we mentioned in our initial report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So that is separate. And I want to I want to speak to the issues separately.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's that's entirely your right to do that. But I was asked a question by the vice mayor about how long this dissipated these things would take. So I'm just answering his question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let's so let's focus on the one through five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You still need 90 days for that? Yes. You need the same 90 days to do your data collection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I need to come back to you and give you options on data collection so you know how much it costs. Because if we wanted to, we could do a data collection process that could cost you a half a million dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You may not want to spend that kind of money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But personally, I think that once we the sooner we get this going, we will be collecting our own data moving forward. And that can guide the process and we can see how effective this is. And as opposed to looking backwards, I think that we can look forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm happy to have that conversation in the meantime. But in regards to these five points, does that satisfy. Well, we have a motion on the floor and it's been seconded and I and it was we've.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you repeat the motion please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The motion that I have down includes all six points. Correct. Not just one through five. It includes all sections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's still 90 days.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for staff, though, to look at what percentage that number six should what percentage, if any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will come with a proposal. But in the end, it's going to be a policy determination by the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Okay. And that doesn't slow down your 90 slow down your days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. The part that slows me down is the data, because the data is the part that scares me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we'll keep that separate. I appreciate that. Okay. So we have a motion and a second digit. I just I do just want to hear the motion back to make sure we've got it all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So. We find it. Okay. So it's to take the five consensus points forward to staff to come back with and then on a parallel track input from the working group on six at the same time to keep them working on it and then.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was seconded by member Odie. And then. County Council member as he Ashcraft asked if there would be no attorneys allowed, just the landlords and Councilmember Matt, R-S.C. agreed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that was that's not part of the motion. It's my understanding that that would go to staff to look at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's separate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From a separate statutory. Yes. Okay. I wasn't sure if that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was in the my staff will take all our comments. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Yes. So it's basically just that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then to at yeah. Have staff gather the necessary data and that's separate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I, I backed that out so that we can have that discussion separately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So thank you. I appreciate that. So we have a motion. Second. All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. Others oppose. Passes unanimously. So now we do have other. Did you want to revisit your data at this point on this? Because I did want to get that done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I think we need to gather the. Hmm. The motion was that we asked staff to prepare a report that answers the questions post September. Staff report. Gathering the necessary data to support those answers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the response from staff was that this would be something they would be looking a consultant for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also contacting other jurisdictions who have similar ordinances in place to gather data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we want I'm sorry, go ahead. And I think hearing the manager's comments, because we can ask how much data do we need to answer, these can rapidly inflate itself. So perhaps having gone through this, we can look at having staff come back with us to us, rather than a report with an estimate of what it might'",
        "'speaker_0': 'take to answer each question. And great range, and then we can revisit it and refine it so that we get the we get the questions answered that really we could prioritize which question really need to be answered. And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And keep within the budget, but actually accomplish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I think remember detox information actually goes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To some of this. That he did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The word helpful. I mean, so we and we have other sources that can help provide this information. So information has been gathered. There is a survey out there that was already taken. So actually, some of you can some of you spoke publicly about your comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can also submit those to council and staff to support this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I? May I? Yes. All right. I want to be crystal clear, because the data that is selected. Will often determine and color the policy decision. Let me give you an example, and I do not mean this in any way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was very impressed with the work that Councilmember de Saag does, and he's always welcome to stop being a council member and come work with staff and do those kinds of reports, because that was terrific. But well, he is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the but the point is the data collected as he. As he stated at the outset, was from the point of view of the tenant. There are other policy decisions. I'm not unsympathetic to that. By the way, I started my career as a legal services attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to be clear. I'm speaking here intellectually. There are other data that may have to do with things like the cost of whether or not the apartment includes heating or doesn't include heating and what the cost of heating oil is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It may not include what other jurisdictions do in terms of requirements about soft stories. There are so many different things. If you took it from the point of view then of the housing provider and then what the costs of that are to a city if we don't keep the housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not making an argument for any of that. My point is what data you collect may very well drive your decision. And I don't want staff to be stepping into what is essentially a policy choice. What you choose to collect, I feel, is itself a policy decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why I want to bring it back to the council. And perhaps it would be more helpful to get a an analysis of. What we should be discussing, because you brought two points of view to bear. I was on the council when we put the soft story ordinance into effect and an unintended consequence of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Spun off of it because of cost. And it was mentioned also the pitch roofs versus the flat roofs. Um, there are other requirements that come up and if we could get the landscape of that so we can have a public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Education of what the landscape is. We might be able to make an informed decision about what data we gather. That and that's what we'd like to do for you, is give you the landscape and then have you pick and choose off the menu what you want us to actually go in and buy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'd like to comment on this in that we have I personally really want to look forward as opposed to backwards and the data that you're going to be collecting, depending upon what it is, is actually data based on a system that we are actually trying to work together and change and make more responsive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I am afraid I'm concerned that rather than looking at so so we've had a lot of agreements made and we got behind these agreements. And the data, the relevant data will be, is it working? But we just changed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is it working? That's that's what we need to know. I actually don't need to know. I think we the reason we're having this conversation is because there did need to be improvement. And now we're hoping moving forward there will be a better relationship that will work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm more focused and I and I really want people to have their energy to focus on how we're going to resolve these cases or this environment that we're working together moving forward. So so that's why that's really my concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That I hear that concern and I think we can accomplish that same. And as even looking forward, we have to understand what the landscape is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to be positive. I really want to stay positive. And I'm afraid that if you spend too much time looking at this other stuff, we know we needed to work together better. That's what this group told me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they also told me they are going to be doing that. Madam Chair, I want to stay positive, too, but I do think that these four questions are important, and especially number one, and I do think it helps us know what the current state of the residential rental market is, so that we know that the solutions we're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hoping to institute are really going to address the the concerns. And that was what is the state of the residential rental market in Alameda. This could I can answer that too. There are next to no rentals available I would if I could just finish because I think staff did a very nice job of putting this together succinctly'",
        "'speaker_2': '. This could include a quantitative analysis of rental rates, vacancy rates, absorption trends, and the length of residency, the race, ethnicity of residents and different types of rental units. The answers to this question will help identify the need and define the problem regarding housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also and the second question goes to the impact of what impact rent control and stabilization, for instance, has had. And the other the one other category I would just like to add to for consideration is age, because we have had a number of seniors that we've heard from that they have been priced out of the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rental market and they especially tend to be on fixed income. So I do think it's important to stay positive, but I do think it's important to note the situation that we're facing and I'm confident that staff can find a way to get that data to us expeditiously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm not I think that they are overburdened. I think that we have a lot of things we're talking about. Do we have is there a motion of someone that wants to make a motion on this issue?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I'll make a motion that we have staff provide us with an analysis of. The. Of the considerations needed to answer the questions that are in the September. Staff report. Yes. And. The potential costs if they can be identified.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Gathering data that might be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Second?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oppose and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Abstain. And frankly, I'm much clearer as to what maybe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if you look at these questions, one of them is what changes have any made to the vote? I get to speak after I vote no, I get to explain my no vote. I thought you usually I voted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You. You passed. No, that's not correct. Procedure is that. Yes, the motion passed. Actually, there was a change. It was three, three in favor, one abstention and one no, thank you. So when you look at these questions, the reason why I'm voting are the first one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What is the state of the residential rental market now? AMITA I've answered that. I think we've heard there are not very many units. And so for me, I want to have staff focused on things that I think are would be more productive for this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Antisocial. I'm sorry. I I'm sorry. You actually as when you vote no, I get to explain my nova. It's not appropriate for you to speak at this time. This could include a quantitative analysis of rental rates, vacancy rates, absorption trends, and the length of residency and races and ethnicity and age was added to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll be curious to see how how much this cost. But I think it's very time consuming and I'm not. And for me, the focus has got to be moving forward. We have an issue moving forward. What's going to happen with our rents?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What have what has what have been the impacts on rental rates, supply of rental housing and the physical condition of rental housing? Again, these are issues that I think will be better raised moving forward. But people this desire to have their just when they have their disputes that it goes direct and I want to support REC and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the community to amicably resolve these and we can do the data collection moving forward. What changes have any need to be made to the city's rent review advisory committee rack? I think motion number one address that. Number four, what changes, if any, need to be made to the Alameda Municipal Code relative to residential rental housing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, I think that we had already directed staff to look at that as part of the first motion. Thank you. And I really do want to thank everyone for coming this evening, submitting all of your written communication.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I encourage you to continue to email all of us and work with RAC. I mean, really, I support all of you coming out here and Mr. Camara Bell staff and you know, I agree we're going to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Moving on. Next agenda item is six I. And is this something that needs to be so? Right now we have one, two, three, four plus all of the referrals. It is 1 a.m. and two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Additional items on the joint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And there's two additional items. And I would request that we allow staff to let us know what needs to be done this evening and that we move those to the next item. STAFF Could you let us know what items you need to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Miss warmer them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Thank you, Madam Mayor. The two items that we really need to discuss. One is from the six K, which is the professional services agreement for our audit audit firm. And then also on the SSI, c is the financial report to accept the audit, which is freebie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And preferably we do three B first because we still have a consultant here from business associates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. So counsel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She's just what would you entertain a motion to? Well, I'm sorry. I had asked earlier about this. So now we are at 1 a.m. address. Let's continue, please. Three B. So to do this procedurally, do we need a motion to move this to the next agenda item?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do we need to do on the next? It's on the next slide.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you can just just decide to call three B or six K and then I guess the rest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, so count. So Council, are you supportive if we just keep moving to the agenda quickly, can't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We just have a concern about you know, some of the referrals have been on there twice and I know somebody in the audience that waited till late last time to talk about it, and they're still in the audience today to talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we want to consider the three or the the referrals that were carried over, I hesitate to want to carry them over to another meeting. In a mirror.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's 1 a.m.. I would prefer that we get to the agenda items that need to be addressed this evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go ahead, madam. It's just a procedural slash, technical slash legal question with regard to hauling over items. We do have a city council meeting tomorrow. So is it altogether politics?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it altogether.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Possible to not close tonight's city council meeting with regard to those items? And are we still within are we brown at correct. And also Sunshine Ordinance, correct if we keep this open and then continue it, keep those referral items open and continue till tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City Council meeting is that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Closure with the I believe that the technical language of the Brown Act and the Sunshine Ordinance would allow you to continue those referral items to tomorrow. It's just a matter of I mean, people are not going to know that and the community might not be very happy about it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think you can do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So then do you need us to rule on to have motions on those two items? So could they could everything wait until tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Preferably to have those two items done and then the other items can be heard tomorrow?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. So, Counsel, are you agreeable to moving forward with the. The first one would be three be. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. And then we're going to deal with the referrals tomorrow belonging.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's a separate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So right now, could we do three be? It could have motion to proceed with three. I'll move that. We proceed with three B second. Just to keep things moving along. I'll second it. All those in favor. I thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll be proceeding with three B at this point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So you recessing the council meeting and calling to order the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There you go. So, yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Got it. Yeah. I have a quick PowerPoint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quick.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. And members of the council. I'm waiting for. Yeah, there we go. So we have a very brief report about the comprehensive annual financial report and. And the audited financial statements and all the compliance reports.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'State law requires this annual audit. City Charter also requires that the auditor provide the annual provide for annual audits and financing covenants, and granting agencies require annual audits with some special testing requirements. There are several standards which apply.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are generally accepted accounting principles, generally accepted auditing standards, and that the audit must be performed by a licensed firm of licensed certified public accountants. Now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Find if.'"

    "Audited Financial Statements and Compliance Reports for FY 2013-14.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'So moving right along. Every financial report, every audited financial statement contains three main sections. Next one to the introductory section, which is just a summary of our organization in the context of the results. The financial section, which first of all contains the independent auditors report, which is their opinion, and we always want to see that they give'",
        "'speaker_5': 'us a clean opinion, that our statements are fairly presented. And the second part of that is the management discussion and analysis, which is a context for all of the results and then the statements. And they are presented in a variety of formats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if you've looked at the reports recently, we follow all of the required generally accepted reporting requirements. So it doesn't look like just in the quarterly financial reports that we give you, but it's done in a variety of fashions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Excuse me, government wide is summarizing those funds which operate to provide services and business type, which are the enterprise funds of which we have only one now with their net position, which is assets and sources as well as liabilities and uses the major funds which are the individual funds, including their budget, the actual position with fund balances'",

Notes to the statement which detail the historic information and provide a narrative description of specific items, including assets and long term liabilities, pensions and OPEB, other post-employment benefit liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if you really want to know more about those issues, you can read the notes and you'll get a lot of detail. Other funds include the non-major. They're smaller in size. They don't have as much operating impact. Internal service funds, which do have impact in that they operate with the operating funds and fiduciary funds, which are things'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that we do in trust for other people or other organizations. The final section is the statistical section, which which presents financial trends, revenue capacity, debt capacity. I put debit debt, debt capacity, demographic and economic information and other operating data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is important to note that this is not audited information in the statistical section. It's what staff, supplies and provides. And we rely on other resources and other agencies to give us information as well. So finally, what are our results for this past fiscal year 2013 and 14?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So all funds grew as revenues increased and expenditures were contained. So it's true overall for all of the funds. Some of the financial highlights, our net position is $402 million, $23 million of which or 5.7% is unrestricted and available for use for future uses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Governmental Funds Combined Fund balance of $95,000,000.20 $9 million 30% is available for other uses, the reserve policy has is 20%. It actually came out to be 40% at the year end. Subsequently, five additional percent has been at three and a half million dollars was added to the reserve as an exigency reserve.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in addition, we added another $3 million for deficiencies and other long term obligations. So we've reduced that 40%. Debt increased by only $289,000. This increase due to the fluctuation in debt service schedules. They're not all even in the state, just the same all the time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the final pieces that the auditors perform is called the Memorandum of Internal Controls and Required Communications, and this report is required under generally accepted auditing standards. And they reported two significant deficiencies. The first first deficiency was is being worked on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that has to do with continuing disclosure. We did not fully meet the requirements by not timely filing all of our reports. We have contracted with a company DAC Bond to maintain and maintain timely quality filings. One one deficiency was resolved and that had to do with the administrative access controls to our accounting system.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we with the movement to the cloud system are able to more finely tuned those controls and maintain better internal controls. New pronouncements by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board will require that we present the pension and OPEB data in new formats, and we are working with consultants already in order to begin formatting that so that the auditors'",
        "'speaker_5': 'will have that information in the format that they need. Finally, we have compliance reports. You see in the exhibits attached to the report that there are a lot of smaller reports. These are compliance reports required by either granting agencies or other parts of the state government.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We all of the data comes directly from the Kafir and is presented in the compliance reports and perhaps in a little bit different format as required by the granting agency. And that's why we have these separate compliance reports.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All of these reports, the audit, the memorandum of Internal Controls and Required Communications and all the compliance reports are posted on our website and are available for everyone to read and query. I'd like to introduce Ms.. Grace Zang from Mason Associates, who has kindly come and kept kept me company this evening and is available to answer any'",
        "'speaker_5': 'really technical questions that you might have about the audit report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ashton's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I'm going to ask, is Adam here? I'm going to ask a general catchall question. Is there anything that, however you so define it that's substantially different in the way in which the report was prepared as substantially different from the way in which reports were prepared in the past?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you need to speak in the microphone up here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Prepared this year with last year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Year before. Yeah we have been the auditors for multiple years and I am not the in chief partner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On a job. I'm just representing Catherine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, based on my knowledge, there is no, um, we have been consistent in our reporting approach. And in other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Words, except for whatever the state says that you have to report now, the methodology, data sources, the way in which the data is treated for the most part is the same as before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's my catch up basket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And I'd like to share that. As far as I know, this presentation was not online. I don't think it was part of this packet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, the presentation is just a summary of what was in the staff report. So no, the present the the powerpoint was not online.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So if the PowerPoint could be added to this and some PowerPoints were included, so then we can see them in advance. And that is my preference, if at all possible. And actually it to me it's an aid and I'm sure it is to our community of it's possible to include the PowerPoints in advance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there was a comment and yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also the there's information in PowerPoint. I think the staff report it. The CAF are the one that jumped off the page to me is the 40% versus 20%. Or if it's not in the staff. Oh, that's the first time I saw.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that came about as I was preparing this and Miss Warmer Day and I were looking at the analysis of what what the results were and we said, oh, look at this. This is an interesting fact that we didn't know when we would just have a report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you can come back and tell us what that really means. Why? Why is there that disparity?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The disparity?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, why why is it so much more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why it grew was because the revenues increased and the expenses didn't. And it it was already at 30 or 35% in prior years. And so what we gained in this particular fiscal year then added it and brought it up to the 40%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I may if I may, in a nutshell, we predicted revenue growth of under 3%. We got 3.6% in one year that went into the reserves, the extra. Then last year we closed at 8.1%, having projected about 2.9.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That all went in reserve as well. And at the same time the labor contracts began to bite into the employees paychecks by taking more out for health care, taking more out for pensions, all of that. So there was there were cuts and costs happening the same time as unexpected growth in revenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And hence, you ended up with a, you know, double the policy in terms of where we are, which is, you know, not a bad problem to have, but it shouldn't be confused with the solution to the long term problems that still loom over the city financially.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why the word unrestricted. Is I mean, it may be true, but it's not. Right. Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A a part of that is unrestricted, but a part of it is restricted by the actions that the previous council took to restrict those that. A $3 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, it's unrestricted and restricted or technical terms for the for the auditors and the accountants. It doesn't mean that anybody should look at it and say this money to general fund is not the only fund. There's a lot of other funds that we manage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things that is changing, however, over the past several years is that pension and other post-employment benefit obligations now must be characterized, according to Gatsby. In the past, you didn't even have to put those on your balance sheet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now you do. I think that kind of application is really important for all the people who may be watching of us to understand the budget that's coming at us a year in calendar year to see what our position.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that, that explanation. Late hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that you will be repeating it that, you know, at another meeting, because I can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tell you I have my notes right here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lisa, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, there will be a systematic approach to the Council regarding the budget beginning in March and working our way through March, April, May, June to get to a two year budget resolution in early June. So as that happens, these issues will be decanted in significantly greater detail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gather member data just quickly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Something like a $29 million budget that amounts to 40% of a 40% reserve, I mean, is absolutely great news with Capital G. I think the key thing for purpose of the public is to understand what's the the key components that's driving it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For example, my understanding is from what former Mayor Mary Gilmore told me, is that a key a key component of that tonight, what contributed to the $29 million reserves is a one time sale of property transactions that generated some level of of of extra taxes that we had not initially calculated, though, that that went to the good'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So so I think that's what we're getting at is whenever there are these big things that we all want, there are great. But also one other big things that are not so great understand. What are the key driving elements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, and we've already discussed those issues for the budget we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And it turns out that in the last revenue report when we announced the 8.1%, we broke it down into these are one timers and these are ongoing and thank you for bringing that up because the the one time events can't be counted on for up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's one of one of my council referrals. Principal I'd like us to discuss. Actually get to that for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other member comments. I'll move. Accepted. And I'd like to make a comment. Oh. So I was at a conference for mayors and new members. Member authority was also there and a slide was presented in regards to Alameda County City's unfunded OPEB liabilities as a percentage of their general fund as of June 30th, 2013.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I want to share this as part of this discussion that showed Alameda, those cities ranged from 7% to 140%. And the city of Alameda was the 140%. And I think it's very important that we share that as part of this conversation, because we were talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, someone paying attention right now on TV could think we're doing actually very well. And then we have this other issue that is very contrary to that that we will be discussing as we're moving forward. I wanted to add that in your motion now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I would move recommendation to accept the fiscal year 20 1314 audited financial statements and compliance reports. All those in favor I oppose. Motion unanimously carries. Thank you. Now the next item meeting. So we will now adjourn that so we can hop to the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam Chair. Just a point of clarification on the item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At three A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is the joint meeting. And we cannot continue that meeting until tomorrow night's meeting because it wasn't noticed as a joint meeting. So that one will have to be deferred until the next meeting of the joint body.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is staff that you're okay with that they'll still care. All right. Thank you. So's council. Most of you are okay with that. So then we're going to have that item come back. That was three. We'll come back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to adjourn that meeting and re adjourn go back to that now reopen our general meeting. And the next item was 66. K is the one that you'd like us to address. Six K is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute a professional services agreement between the city and AFRINIC, Brian Day and Company for two year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For two years with three one year extensions for a total.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amount not to exceed $750,400 for independent audit services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any questions? Yes, I would just make a comment that not only and I think the point was well stated in the report that it's not that the current auditing firm has done anything wrong, but they've been our independent auditors for 24 consecutive years.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'And sometimes it's just good to get some fresh thinking and new blood in. And if we do approve this contract, we will actually be saving $32,725 over a five year period compared to the previous fees charged by the previous firm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. I would certainly move approval or of the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I second it especially given the. From a pool of eight candidates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a city auditor was on the selection team. Any other comments? All those in favor. I oppose motion unanimously passes. Thank you. Now of. In regards to the other the balance of today's agenda numbers. What would you like us to do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My opinion? Yes. My opinion is that we continue the matter. Moreau but doing so if if if allowable under Brown Act and and that's an ordinance because no 130 right now and you know you just think that will be fresher and the public would be better served.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So like yes I just make clarify. So just to be sure that what we're saying here, all of the items that are still remaining, you want to continue to tomorrow night's meeting that correct.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So and if there's if there's some items that can wait, then maybe we could get together. We can discuss that to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Met a mayor asking a question to the city attorney. So is the correct way to proceed and make a motion to recess. And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Uh, what, what.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Those can be those. I would suggest you move those to the meeting of February 3rd so that you can focus on what you're going to be doing tomorrow and getting the referrals done if that's what you're going to do.'",
