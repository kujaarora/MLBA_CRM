My name is Brad Farmer, and I'm in the finance department. The city here. We're looking currently at the second quarter collections for sales tax that actually were sold and collected in the first quarter for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'last year. So just to remind you, I know two weeks ago you were reminded that there was a lag period of 90 days. This is the second one that we received. One of the nice parts about this current one is that we're at 40%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Compared to last year, we were at 32%. So we're a little bit ahead. One of the questions that did arise last time was there was a $313,000 one time adjustment. The entities that were adjusted to actually are on our normal tax roll.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that will continue to come forward. Second side you're seeing there is the best part is for the last 13 quarters were up 28%. And it seems to be a pretty solid trend line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. But.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the. Trends that we see, we basically see strong sales pretty much across the board in the top 25 are really strong and top 100 continue to be very aggressive. Business and industry continue to lead the way. Order by restaurants in general.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Consumer goods. Probably the biggest thing that we're going to have coming, I think, is going to be the online retail sales, which are going to come from the county pool. That seems to be the fastest growing area is me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unless we can get more retailers in here and this is going to continue to probably be our fastest growing pool. This graph here shows you basically the industries. And as I said, business and industry restaurants and consumer goods tend to be really strong.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The one concern that I would have if there's anything is going to be on fuel and as you noticed, the prices, I think when we were here last time, we're down about $0.25. Tesoro just had a strike, so prices jumped again, $0.30 in the last two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that all depends on what happens in the fracking industry and as the prices go up and down per barrel. But I think this is where we're going to see some loss in the next year, probably as well as HTL, who handles all of our sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They also suggested that this might be the case. And then once again, we are still at the bottom of the chart as far as sales tax goes. The countywide tax, or this was another question that came up last time was 9%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In San Leandro, it's 9.25. Albany is 9.5 and else redo is 9.5. Those are all special taxes that their council along the voters represented and passed to get on to their ballots. We don't currently have that. Any questions?'",

        "'speaker_7': 'But evening, Madam Mayor and members of the city council. So. Oops. Oh, we've got to change. Change the scene over here. I'm going to talk with you about the quarterly investment report. All right. Faster than I could have done it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So as you will recall and we talked about last time, the government code requires that if the city council so directs that we are required to report to you on a quarterly basis and we must state that it complies with our investment policy and that there is cash coverage for the next six months.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those are the requirements in state law. Our investment policy was last updated in February of 2014. So it's coming back to you soon. It stresses safety, liquidity and yield. It provides limitations on the type credit, credit, quality and duration of investments as outlined in state law.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the policy itself is located on the Finance Department website. In case anyone is interested in reading all of the fine details included in that policy. All of these limitations are intended to preclude the misuse of public investments in risky investments over a long period of time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the city's statement of investment policy is very typical and is in conformance with the State Treasurers Association. Last month we were asked the question about limiting losses. And Kevin Kennedy, our elected city treasurer, is going to speak to that issue when we address the update to the investment policy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The report contents are determined by state law as well. In the staff report. A short summary is of the portfolio is displayed. The investment types are listed from the most liquid to the least liquid. Market value is provided by the investment advisors and reflects the market on the final day of the quarter being reported.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is compared to the cost or book value for review purposes only. Every negative number indicates that the market value is less than the book value. The average duration is the average age of the investment. To measure the performance of the portfolio, the two year U.S. Treasury bill rate is used as the comparison.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In this case, the portfolio performed at about 2.28%, better than the two year Treasury bill rate. And the exhibit contains the detailed investments by INSTRUMENT, and the advisory firms report on the credit quality and the return for their individual portions of the portfolio.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Most of the portfolio is in restricted in its uses. The majority of this is debt service funds or other special revenue funds. Those funds are not totally restricted, are in the general fund and in the internal service service funds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cash is managed on a daily basis with the goal of making certain that six months of need payroll accounts payable, debt service will be met. Historically, Alameda has had two investment advisory firms. The 1 to 3 year portfolio is managed by public financial management.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the 3 to 5 year portfolio was managed by Chandler Asset Management. Both firms must, must comply with the investment policy, and the policy also prohibits investment in companies which receive more than 51% of the gross revenues from cigarets alcohol or other gambling products.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And again, elected city treasurer Kevin Kennedy will speak to the issue of socially responsible investing when we address the investment policy. This is a summary of the investment portfolio as of December 30th. Investments with bond trustees. Are those funds required to be held by the trustee by bond covenants?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A duration less than 3030 days indicates that they are very liquid and the local agency investment fund is managed by the State Treasurer's office. The maximum that we are allowed to invest is $50 million. Between these funds and cash on deposit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The six month cash needs are met. The certificates of deposit are safe instruments for holding small amounts required to be maintained for a variety of purposes. The remainder are instrument instruments managed by PFM and CAM two investment advisory firms.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The quick thumbnail gives the reader a quick view of the elements of the portfolio how the book and market value compare and the duration and average yield. Last quarter, the average will yield was 0.35% and the total total portfolio was about 157 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This this increase in cash is due to the closing of the 2014 refunding bonds sold on December 23rd, 2014. And that concludes my report.'",

I just wanted to share that the second page of the Treasury report provides that Kevin Kennedy, our city treasurer, has reviewed the City Values Treasury report for this quarter ending December 31st, 2014, and found that it complies with the investment policy established'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I know we're having some technical issues. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Oh. So.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This financial report is for about midway through our fiscal year, and it certainly will show us if we are succeeding. Which we are. And if we are being able to keep spending within our budget and yet revenues are coming in at a rate greater than what we had anticipated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm going to start and we'll catch up. But I love it. Oh, okay. Well, just so. Now. I want to go. Back when. Financial reports are presented quarterly to the city council and to the successor agency of the Community Improvement Commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The first three quarters are unaudited and no independent auditor reviews those results. The fourth quarter has some review by independent auditors, but are still not final numbers. There are three components to each report the general fund revenue and general fund expenditures, capital projects and the summary of all funds for each element.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The year to date expenditures are compared to budget. General Fund is also compared to prior year and the summary of all funds provides year to date results. Overall we are on budget with 51% of the revenues collected and 48% of the current year expenditures, expenditures through one half of the year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we've collected more revenue than we anticipated and we are spending a little bit less than we had otherwise anticipated. Now, some of those differences are due to timing. Some of them may be too, as the expenditures may be lower due to other causes, such as vacancies in budgeted positions, etc..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here is the second, second quarter or year to date revenues. Second quarter revenues are within expected results. Property taxes were received in late December and expected again in May or June. So that's a very kind of lumpy revenue stream.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't get don't get their biggest revenue except for two times a year. Sales tax revenues are one payment behind schedule at quarter end, but collections are higher than the prior year. So it looks good compared to the budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Utility users. Tax collections are slower than expected. And we are watching this item closely. We think that there is a change in the marketplace due to. Due to the definition of what the utility user's tax can apply to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so there's a lot of. Definitions and discussions going on among cities and among the utility user tax payers, collectors and payers. So we're watching that item very, very closely. Franchise tax collections are on target. The transfer tax appears to be ahead of schedule, but includes approximately $280,000 of one time payments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in the next quarter, we know that there are some bigger one time payment. So it's we have to keep it keep those in mind as we look at this. This item, the transient occupancy tax is ahead of schedule as local hotels, motels are experiencing a higher occupancy rate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't have any track on what they charge for rooms and we know that it can vary if they offer rooms. There are extra vacant rooms. On websites that give discounts. So we don't know what roommate rate they're applying it against.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Business licenses are renewed in July, yielding almost all of the revenue in the first quarter of the fiscal year and departmental revenues. Are those revenues unique to each operating department? And they are on track. Interest and rental income is ahead of expectations due to the timing of receipts in the second quarter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the cost allocation. These are charges to other funds for services provided by by the operating departments is on target. Transfers in and other revenues are on target through the second quarter and which was slightly behind during the first quarter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's talk about our expenditures. Expenditures are under 50%, indicating spending slower than budgeted. In the general government category. That's the city council, the city manager, city clerk, city attorney, economic development. They're spending at a slower rate than expected through the second quarter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We think that's primarily because some of the larger budget items have not been expended as yet. Contract services, those kinds of things. Administrative Services, Finance and human services are spending at a slower rate than budgeted, but are tracking to be on budget for the rest of the year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Police spending is lower than anticipated as vacancies continue to create savings. Fire spending is close to on budget for the first two quarters of this year. Although we do note that their overtime is higher and that is because of unexpected emergencies to which they had to respond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recreation and Parks is just under budget and anticipates being within budget for the next quarter. Public works is slower than anticipated due to vacancies, creating savings, transfers, out support other functions and are slightly ahead due to the timing of projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Otherwise, they are on target. Let's talk about the other funds. The capital maintenance projects are under 50% of budget. But these are hard to predict because they all have a different schedule. And, you know, the size of the dollars in the budget influences the outcome.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But individually they appear to be well within where they are expected to be. The fun balanced summary shows the subtitles by each fun group which have similar characteristics. The Internal Service Fun Group is represented by working capital and not a fund balance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The working capital is that portion that is usable. The successor agency has unique reporting requirements. Total debt is included and included, resulting in a negative fund balance. So if you look at that, please don't get excited as I did the first time I read it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is a requirement of the new laws relating to dissolution of the redevelopment agencies. Revenues are tax increment and I received in January of this year. The next payment is expected in May or June timeframe. And that concludes.'",

And if I may, Madam Mayor, and therefore, I think it's important at this time to get instruction, to get confirmation or other instruction from the council about the proposal, from the staff in number three, which is. And it's the report says, you know, with council's concurrence, we would propose to speed the creation of a liaison committee'",

        "'speaker_5': 'But that is a potential option, given there was a clear desire at the time this referral came forward to look at the historic relationship. And the historic relationship going back 30 years is that they did meet jointly. Again, it's not the staff's recommendation or recommendation is two from each body and meeting quarterly, and we would propose that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to the regional park district this week.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice Mayor Yeah, I, I think that the formation of a liaison committee was clear in the referral. It's a method that's been used with the school district here. It's been a method that's been used with AC Transit District to much success.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And those the members of that liaison committee would bring the recommendations jointly worked out in in those meetings to the respective bodies for action. And my question is, let's let's get started on this and let's do it now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm as is of the essence, I think. And we also part of this of this referral was to help rebuild a good working relationship between the city and the park district, because this is not the only project out there, $6.5 million of East Bay Regional Park money slated for Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think a liaison committee would be very helpful in sifting through the pieces and bringing a recommendation to the respective boards on how to move forward on spending that money. So I'm in favor of getting this resolution on the board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with the city manager. That joint meeting of the two boards, the council and the East Bay Regional Parks Board is difficult to schedule and unwieldy. And the liaison committee is the shortest distance between two points.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. If that's the will of the council, the.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And as a school board member, when I was on the school board and worked with these gentlemen and the Park District to bring a resolution in front of the school district, and I'm very proud to have been able to work with East Bay Parks again, to be part of bringing this to our city to to approve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I agree and I appreciate member Ashcraft stepping up on this and her explanation. She's absolutely right. It is imperative that the East Bay parks have a resolution like this so then they can do their work and have the best possibility of being successful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you very much. And again, so I also want to thank staff for their work on this. So keeping having that stated all those in favor. I oppose motion the resolution as approved unanimously. Thank you. And now in regards to the liaison committee.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And so I have a question. Would we select members at a future meeting or do we do that at this point? But to come back?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Protocol would be you have to wait for them to formally accept. You can bring it back at another meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's it'll. You could bring it back. I mean, you could even put it on the agenda. I don't think it requires a report, a written report. You could put it on the agenda for the March three, the March three meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then go into, you know, go and do that as you choose. But that's up to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't buy most.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How you do that is up to you. Not if you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want to amend your motion by saying it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Matt. Yeah, I was just going to make the suggestion that perhaps because it seems like it's been sufficiently publicly noticed, perhaps the council could actually decide who are two committee members would be. And then certainly pending acceptance of our offer to the the acceptance of the park district's reciprocal agreement, this could then come back perhaps just'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Sure. Because we're going to be speaking with them about a meeting date. So this week. So, I mean, not the meeting this week, but we'll be talking with them this week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we could put it on.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But we could express an interest in being part of that liaison committee today.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm Madam City attorney. Acting city attorney. So on the title of the the staff report here. So it's adoption of a resolution supporting a conveyance of the surplus federal property on McKay Avenue. We've done that and approved the work plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pursuant to City Council's directions. So the work plan, is it not these four specific actions under discussion. What is the work plan that we're discussing?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, if I may just I understood the workplan to be the four items that are under discussion. The only issue is whether somebody's looking at the agenda with no one appointment. What's happening? So, I mean, the council the council can take the decision it wants to take, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why not cross your ts would be my advice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there are four points that are specified on staff's report. And it says number three is establish a council, East Bay Regional Park District Liaison Committee. It does not include language and appoint members. And I think that's the issue being raised.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Up to the body. It's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's fine. It's not that I'm over the anxious that we have to do it tonight. It's just that we sent. We tend to have a lot of agenda items coming back to us. And I was just thinking, if your economy is fine, but maybe it's time to stop discussing this one and move on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perhaps we could bring it back as a consent calendar item as John.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, so do we. If we want to discuss who would be on, we don't have to vote on that tonight. You want to have the discussion and then it could come back on consent, if that's the council's desire.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Were you to bring it back on consent, then you'd have to have the names, which means you'd have to discuss it tonight. Which means it doesn't talk about appointment here. I would. I think you should just have it as a regular agenda item at your next meeting so you can decide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then going back to appointments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Going back to the motion. The motion is to set up the liaison committee and to agenda is on the third. After hearing back from East Bay regional parks that they're agreeing to it and to sit the committee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Isn't it broader than that? Because it proves the work plan would be all four of those items, right. Or is that just assumed in proving this?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're asking for you to approve the work plan. I mean, just. Okay. Yeah. You approve the work plan is the appointment that I'm advising you not to actually do. Yeah. Okay. And you can't do it by consent. Or you would have almost certainly violated the Brown Act by having a chain meeting to decide whose name was going'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to be in there to consent to. So you don't want to do that either.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I'm going to call the question. All those in favor. I oppose none. Motion carries unanimously. Thank you. Now we're on item six be.'"

        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So, for example, I do not have the expectation that on February 25th that we will we will know that we want a shuttle and we want a shuttle with ten minute headway. We want and we want to spend as much as the city of Emeryville spends on Emery go around, which is roughly $3 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do not have the expectation that that will emerge on on February 25th or soon abouts. But I do have the expectation that out of it will emerge a desire to as next steps to begin. What does it take to begin to get these kinds of an understanding as to the different types and levels of of transit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'solutions that we that we might go after a first we have to have some shared agreement that that that is in fact the approach. And I think in having the February 25th meeting that you're having and then subsequently the march, it begins to outline that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. I was just going to say, if I may, I just I want to I think that's exactly right. And that's what we've thought, too, is that, you know, and I'm glad I wanted to make sure, you know, and hopefully when you actually read the report, you still agree.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the intent was really we're not going to come to you with a detailed scope of every single thing that is going to be addressed in this scope of work. But what we are doing, though, is kind of setting out some I mean, we are going to, you know, staff's job, we believe, to make some recommendations to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of, you know, look, we went back and looked at all the documents we have. We've talked to you know, we've really analyzed things and really thought through it. And so we do have some recommended approach to it and a process that we think might make sense to help figure this out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Some principles, some goals and things of what we might accomplish in the study. But that's exactly right. Like creating that framework, helping everyone to understand what that framework is that we already have. And then where are the holes?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How do we fill them? What should the study do? And so that's what we've tried to make that approach or we're trying to take that approach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I am more than happy to kind of just type out. People still use the word type, type out. Some of the thoughts as to why I thought that when I mean, I, I acknowledge, you know, there there is a lot of hard work that went into the different teams.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But in my opinion, I did think that there were some extra level steps that were still needed and that was the whole one of the points of it. So I'm more than happy to type out even more, you know, what do I mean by extra level steps and how does that sync up?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ultimately with the process that you're putting in place.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And so we'll hopefully whatever we put forward will facilitate a productive conversation about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Brody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I also agree that this is, you know, a good plan, I guess. And thank you for expediting it. I have two questions. The last one, based on feedback provided by the council staff, prepare periscope and budget and consulting contract.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I know we kind of haven't had the February 25th meeting. We haven't had the March ten meeting, but know can you can you give me a ballpark on one the time frame to finish the finish, whatever the end product that we asked the consultant to deliver will be the deliverable and then kind of a ballpark on'",
        "'speaker_6': ', on budget because I saw some number on the Internet today. And, you know, I'm not sure if that's a that's a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So our ballpark for what we're proposing and it really is it's a range and it's a wide range because it really does depend on a couple of different factors, which I'll mention in a second. But is 250000 to $400000 to do a study like this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It really depends. And you'll see. And then the schedules are affected by the same thing. But we've outlined in the staff report that'll go out tomorrow for the joint meeting and then ultimately for March 2010 is a very detailed process scope and that is about it estimates.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know this is based I do a lot of consultant studies so went through is about 17 months. And 4 to 6 months, if you do an RFP takes 4 to 6 months to do and after being selected consultant and then probably another, you know, maybe if it's expedited, it could be 12 to 18 months.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it really in the factors that really is how much community participation do you want? How many times do we come back to the Transportation Commission Planning Board? We've taken a pretty aggressive, you know, a lot of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if you look at it and say, maybe we could save here, we could save there, we could cut down the time. But every time we go to the Transportation Commission, Planning Board, City Council, it's a month ahead of time essentially for the staff report, for each of those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then if you want to actually have the council respond to what the Transportation Commission, the planning board says, you can't do them to close because you need time to turn around a council staff report. So those meetings, how many of those formal meetings we have make pretty much a a big difference in terms of cost and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'schedule. And so we've done the kind of very intense community engagement. And if, you know, if that feels like two months much, then we can scale that back an RFP, you know, maybe we could do it for months, but it usually, you know, depends on how much again, how much community stakeholders do you want involved in the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'selection of the consultant scheduling those things? It unfortunately just takes time, but that is that is what we're estimating at this point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the 250 to 400 is that include staff time or is that just the outside consulting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just outside consultant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Time? Well, that's still less than the number I saw online.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, okay. Well, that's good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's good news.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hopefully we're right. Ultimately.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do have a speaker for this. Thank you. So unless there's more questions, then I'd like to go ahead and call the speaker.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, John Spangler.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you again, Spencer. Members of the council. I appreciate the vice mayor. His remarks early on about the connection between the number of people needing to be moved from A to B and the number of vehicles. And I'm glad this plant gestation process is underway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I want to say that in the many months leading up to tonight's presentation on Alameda Point and on the Del Monte, I heard a lot of people saying. The traffic is terrible. First of all, it's not terrible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you've ever driven into downtown San Francisco at rush hour. Okay. We have no problem at all. And an extra 2 minutes in the tube at 8:00 or 5:00. It's peanuts. We don't know how good it is. And if anybody has trouble parking on Park Street ride a bicycle, it's really easy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There is no parking shortage there of. The problem with most of the comments I've heard about traffic and congestion in the last 15 years I've been in Alameda is that people are thinking that everybody gets to drive his or her own car everywhere he wants to go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We are no longer doing that. When I helped the bikes onboard BART Task Force two years ago with some research, we found out that bike commuting in San Francisco and most other Bay Area communities is up 70% over less than ten years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is a trend line that is not changing. The same is true of BART ridership. It's going through the roof. And so is AC transit ridership. We don't have to worry so much about the number of cars in the tube because people are giving them up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we need in our transportation planning process that was now underway. And I I'm glad to hear the organizational scheme that's that's been adopted. We need to look at making sure we rebalance the skills not only so that there's more rental housing and only to point, but so that there's more access to transit choice in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If our transportation is working on transit transportation choices, this is a major sea change. They are finally paying attention to what's been going on in the Bay Area for three decades. So we need to not be stuck in 1960s or 1950s thinking when we're talking about transportation problems and worry about how many cars are going to go'",
        "'speaker_5': 'through the tube with rush hour. We need to look at how we're going to move people and make rational choices based on how you move the maximum number of people. Given currently available technology it means you put more AC transit number 51 a busses on the road and it's very easy to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We just have to build more housing that has higher density in more concentrated places like we're doing in the North Waterfront, like we're doing on measure a at site a rather so that we can justify sustainable, convenient service that takes care of the problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's all we have to do. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. He was our only speaker on the item. So my comments go to a. And I'm assuming the council members are done. My cases go to the notice on the for the February 25th meeting. I don't know if other council members are interested in attending that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to attend and I don't know if we need to give notice to include city council members so that we could all attend if we wanted, if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can post that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd appreciate that. And then that was my only turn on that. And we're all welcome to attend. Thank you very much. Next item six E and that was for information only. Right. Next item six.'"

    "Resolution to Revise the Sewer Service Charge and Set Protest Procedures.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Adoption resolution declaring the city's intention to revise the sewer service charge and establish procedures for accepting protests pursuant to Article x i d of Section six a of the California Constitution regarding property related fees and charges. Good evening, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members of the City Council. City Staff. My name is Aaron Smith. I serve as the city's public works coordinator. Before it tonight is adoption of a resolution to set council's intent to raise the city sewer service charge, according to the procedures set forth in California's Proposition 218.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over the last few months, the city has engaged with Bartle and Wells Associates to conduct a comprehensive review of our sewer fund bottles and bottling wells as a local public finance and consulting firm. They have nearly 50 years experience guiding public agencies in California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The results of their findings are included in Exhibit one to the agenda item, the Sewer Rate Study and Alison Lajovic of Bartle and Wells will actually be presenting a summary of those findings this evening. One last note before Allison's presentation for clarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The resolution tonight is not authorizing the increase of the super serious charge. It's authorizing city staff to move forward in sending written notice to Alameda property owners announcing the proposed rate increase and the public hearing that's scheduled for April 28th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The resolution tonight also establishes the submission and tabulation of protests for that public hearing. The city council does have the authority to approve the increase in rate subsequent to the public hearing, assuming that there's not a majority protest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'll be available for any questions. Following Alison's presentation, I hope that she'll be able to provide you with the content you're seeking. I can answer any programmatic questions afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Erin. Okay. So the bottom line is that the city of Alameda is under an EPA consent decree. So that's the Environmental Protection Agency consent decree to conduct sewer repairs and replacements and to have funding available for that. Sewer rates and charges must increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if funding is not available, sewer rates are not adequate to make those replacements of the sewer system. The city will face fines, civil liabilities and the potential for sewer overflows. So that is why we are here today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Yeah. Um. Yes, please. Oh, thank you. Okay. So the city owns and operates a sewer collection system, so that includes pipelines and pump stations that collect and convey wastewater flow to the East Bay Municipal Utility District, regional treatment facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So today we're just focusing on almeida's sewer pipelines and pump stations and East Bay Mudd's regional treatment facilities are totally separate from this rate study. So the city has already accomplished a lot of work in upgrading the sewer system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Continue. You've replaced a good number of miles of pipeline, reduce your sewer overflows. But there's a lot more work that's mandated, legally mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Three miles of sewer pipeline per year. Pump station replacements and condition assessments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to fund this significant amount of work, the city relies on sewer rates and charges paid by the residents of this community. And what I found was that the city of Alameda, its current rates and charges are actually low to moderate for the East Bay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this chart shows the average single family residential monthly sewer bill and Almeida's sewer bill is $23.23 per month, which is significantly lower than Oakland, Albany and Piedmont. And so Berkeley and City are actually lower than City of Berkeley or city of Alameda right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But siege and El Serino has already adopted rate increases. And City of Berkeley is actually considering a 25% increases potentially that high. So Alameda is is well priced in this area for sewer service. Okay. So you the city last increased rates in 2010, there was a 14%, 14%, 14% and then inflationary cost increases thereafter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the city also issued sewer bonds in 2012. And those sewer bonds are municipal debt that allows you to fund large repair and replacement projects. Those 14.7 million in projects and we conducted a financial plan for the sewer program as part of our analysis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we are spending down the sewer bond proceeds first. And as a second priority, we're spending down available cash reserves. So those are past sewer rates and charges that have built up in a fund over time. But over the longer term, we propose to increase the sewer rates by 3% annually, and that's roughly equal to the rate'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of inflation. So I did some historical research. The Consumer Price Index has averaged around 3%. Pipeline replacement costs are increasing because all the other local agencies are redoing their sewers as well. So it's really on pace with inflation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those cost increases are needed to fund your EPA consent decree mandated items to keep up with inflation and promote long term financial stability for the Superfund. And the good news is 3%. Equals $0.70 per month. It's only $0.70 increase per month for the average single family residential customer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this charges illustrates that the majority of the service base in Alameda is single family and multi-family residential customers. And this chart illustrates the proposed rates comparison to the current rates. So 3% annually for five years, that's the proposed rate of increase and $0.70 per month increase for the first year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then $0.72, $0.74, 76, 78. And U.S. multifamily. Residential customers pay slightly less. They release less sewer flow on average, so they pay proportionately less. And then commercial customers have a minimum charge and then a flow charge if they release more sewer flow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And so the bottom line is, even with the proposed increases, Alameda sewer rates and charges will be very comparable to all the other East Bay municipal utility district feeder sanitation agencies. So there's not even a change in ranking there with the proposed increases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda is proposed to stay between berkeley and Oakland. So as Erin described, the next steps will be to authorize the Proposition 218 process. That's the legal statute that governs how sewer rates can be implemented in California. We would develop and mail a notice to all impacted property owners, and they would have the opportunity to protest the proposed'",
        "'speaker_0': 'rates. They would also have the opportunity to speak at a public hearing regarding the rates. And if there is a majority protest, then the rates could not be implemented. So those are the conclusions of my study and I'm open to questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member Ashcraft Oh, I was just, I'm really going to make a comment because Councilmember Desai and I served on the previous council. We lived through the, the lawsuit and the consent decree and all that. So I am fully aware of the need to do this and ready to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But thank you both to Ms.. Smith and to you for a nice presentations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This. We don't have any speaker steps. So at this point, council, you could do both questions and comments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Members, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I just looked up my property tax bill to find out my sewer city sewer rates. And so my annual city sewer is 200 7876, which is basically 23.23. As you would indicate on the month end. But the important thing, though, for the public, though, it's really while we're we're talking things on a monthly basis, the'",
        "'speaker_3': '23.23, it's really the annual rate because we're multiplying it by 12. So so I'm paying 278 and then I will subsequently pay 280 795. But I think the key thing, though, and I think it's important. Is that, you know, by increasing it by 3%, as you indicate there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think 3% is normal inflation, even though right now we're in an extremely low inflation period. But I think 3% is a reasonable rate. So technically, really not even ethnically actually increased. We're not increasing it in real inflation adjusted dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're just it's the same money as increasing it. So we're always paying 278, but it's 278 expressed in future dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. I don't tell anyone that. So, yeah. As a council member, as he Ashcraft said, this is an important decision that we have to that we've made. And, you know, when I look at the rate at which we're increasing it, it's quite reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are right. I think most people right now are paying 278 or $23 a month, however you want to say it. And as we increase it from one year to the next using a 3% factor, I mean, that's a reasonable increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to thank you for bringing this. And I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. But I'm really.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry. Thank you, Madam Mayor. It's a quick question on the process and then another one on the sewer system overview. So. The number was like 19,500. So a majority of those 19,500 have to protest in order for this not to go into effect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct? 50% plus one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then on this, this may be getting into the into the plan. And I apologize. I'm doing that. But so we are the hundred 28 miles minus the 13 that we've already replaced. I mean, how many miles are we going to replace with this new.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This new plan and over how long of a time period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was only 13 miles. In the last five years, the city has replaced probably about somewhere between 35 and 38% of its from original installation. The consent decree requires approximately three miles per year for the next 23 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, so it's a 23 year project. And this is this is on the property tax bill. It's not like what they do in Oakland where they slap it on the East Bay mud bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's stuff. It's dedicated sewer fund. We collect it through the county tax roll, but it's not a tax, but we collect it through county tax rules. So it's two and two payments, two installments per year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then on the on the plan for the the 23 years, are we going to see that at a future meeting or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So the city's near completion of what we're calling a sewer master plan. So we've conditioned assessed our entire system and we've ranked each pipes, essentially assigned a risk score that's based on the consequence and likelihood of failure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll be able to lay out which pipes are going to be replaced when during those next 23 years and then be able to coordinate other utility construction projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'll save my questions on that till I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can elaborate on that. Bob on Public Works Director, essentially, we have to take.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It and I'm sorry to interrupt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have to do 2.6 miles per the consent decree. So the program is really three miles of sewer every single year for the next 23 years that we once we get the condition assessment, the finish up our CCTV, then we're going to rank the pipes well square the pipes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Leaving aside the progress and where we're going to hit first in the primary areas, that's the meat of the consent decree. There's some other ancillary things, but that's really the meat of the thing as far as the work that we have to do, because we transferred the private sewer or lateral ordinance over to the state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the key is the three miles here. I just want to remind council I take every opportunity to remind everybody about this. The sewers in the city of Alameda are the city's largest asset at $202 million. So it's really an investment in our largest asset.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. This is biggest thing we own. The most expensive thing we own are the sewers. And one of my consideration in replacing pipe is we're replacing it. So there's going to be very likely a longer seismic lifetime. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we have an earthquake, clay tile pipe will not make it. But the type of pipe we're using that welded together as opposed to joints or things like that, that's going to have a much higher probability of survival.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, yeah. Well, just briefly, statewide, I was asking that question. I was at a East Bay broadband summit a couple of weeks ago, and one of the things they talked about was Digg once and also about building a broadband infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, I mean, I don't know if three, three miles a year, over 23 years, I mean, who knows what technology will be in 23 years? But I was just wondering if that was something, you know, we would be interested in, in pursuing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it doesn't seem like it's going to be feasible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's kind of incremental and it's going to be again, it's going to be based upon the condition assessment of the pipe. So we might be jumping, we might be doing a block here and then moving over to the West End and doing another block over there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to be really based upon. So we're going to be kind of moving around the island.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Well, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And I think we need a motion to continue the meeting past 11 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All those in favor. My motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Any other council member questions? Comments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got to do this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. I did have some questions and I wanted to and also share on page. I believe it's on page eight of the report. It speaks to the history of the rate increases. And according to this report. It said that since 2010, sewer rates had increased by approximately 56% for the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With the city completing its last rate study in 2010, which included annual rate increases of 14% per year for fiscal years 2011 to fiscal year 2013. So so that's a significantly higher increase that we're speaking to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. In 2010, Red Oak was actually the consulting firm who did that. And at the time, the city was under an administrative order. But the amount of work that was going to be defined under our regulatory orders was not it wasn't defined at that point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you you go back to that 2010 rate study, it's actually based on a number of different scenarios, of projected scenarios of what they thought was going to be the workload under our regulatory requirements. The highest scenario that they did was two miles per year of pipeline replacement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, here we are now under consent decree and it actually ended up being three years. So hence there's that additional increase needed in this this go round. In addition to the fact that the 2012 sewer bond provided a lump sum of money, the majority of that's going to pump station renovation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then obviously, we'll kind of soften the impact of this this 3% rate increase as we spend that down in the next couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what were the rate increases for fiscal year 2011 through 13?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They were 14% per year for three years and then it was CPI for the last two OC.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then the CPI you shared earlier was approximately the same 3%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The CPI for those specific years. Do we have that? 2.4% in 2014 and 2.7% in 2015.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I'd like to share as much as we can with the community. So they're aware that back in 2011, 313 for those 11, 12, 13, those three years, it was a 14% increase per year. And then it was anywhere it was 2.4 and then 2.7% in years 14, 12, 14 and 15.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is just a little bit higher than the last two years, but significantly less than the the prior three years. On page nine of the study shares that there's going to be a debt service reduction with the sentences that two of the SRF.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is clean water. Revolving fund loans will be paid off in fiscal year 2018, which will reduce the annual debt service to payments of approximately 900,000 beginning in fiscal year 2019. So there so there will be less expenditures when we get to paying that off.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yet you're still thinking that we'll need the 3% at that point per annum increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so remember we have will have exhausted the 2012 sewer bond, which right now, you know, we have from when it was issued a three year period to exhaust those funds. So we're making use of those now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then and I'm sorry, I don't seem to have the page number, but it says that there's a reduction, a drawdown on the reserves, too. Apparently, the study thinks that there should be a target number for the reserves and that the amount in the reserves has been above that, so that there would be what is best'",
        "'speaker_1': 'described as a moderate decrease in the amount of reserves. However, it's approximately 50% from 27.4 million to 15 million. And do we expect it then to stay at 15 million for future years once we get there? Are we continuing to draw down?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah the target is and it's specified it's a believe a year of capital, 60% of operating and a year of debt service. And that is the best management practices for maintaining a baseline operating fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the the 3% would be sufficient to maintain that 15 million. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, we're only approving tonight of five years. So borrowing whilst projection is for 20 years. So there's financial stability for those 20 years. But tonight's resolution and the proposition to 18 only dictates that we can increase rates up for a five year period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how many years before we reach the 15 million draw down? Where is that in this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the end of five year period.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So at that point, we've drawn down to half of our reserves. But you're not continuing. Do you have your projection beyond that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We would have to come back in 2019 for this very same process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So my concern would be. So I'd like to see the numbers that say that in fact. After Year five, do we have to increase the rate significantly above the 3% to not continue drawing down because that just shows a great reduction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To me, a signal even was described as a moderate reduction and I would actually suggest that that's an inappropriate definition or choice because it goes from 27.4 million to 15 million, which is half, almost half of the reserves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's a significant drawdown. I don't interpret that as a moderate, and then that's within that five year period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in the appendix of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our report, we show all for the full 20 year period. And we show. Basically inflationary increases each year of the 20 years. And at that level of rate, the fund balance would continue to be at the minimum operating recommended target that we developed, which was the 60% of annual operating cost plus one year pipeline replacement expenditure, plus'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the annual debt service payments. So we have forecast over the 20 years and maintain that level of reserve. Fiscal year 2015 is a higher than normal reserve year because you do have all that bond funding still sitting in an account and you're legally required to spend that on projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's a normal flow of funds to reduce that bond funding. The first two years, fiscal year 15 and 16 also have very high costs for the pump station replacements. So it's about 5.2, 5.3 million, and the remaining years don't have that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's a high capital expenditure in the first few years which will draw down funds and then will maintain a healthy level of funds. For the next 17 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So is there somewhere within this document or that we're approving that provides that because this is my concern really is come five years, someone else will be standing in front of us with some new numbers. So where is the protection to the consumer here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I don't think we'll legally per proposition to 18. We're not authorized to. Council's not authorized to commit the rate to anything beyond five years. So as much as I think this can lay out for in five years, when we do another rate study that will relook at this that can say, well, this was the plan at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the time was to continue this 3%. But beyond that, I don't think there's anything legally we can do to bind the council in five years to a subsequent rate increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I wasn't speaking to that. I was speaking to the target of maintaining the reserves at the 15 million for that that that's clearly set but spoken to somewhere in the document because that's that's what you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. And we can can we can put that as like a financial policy related to the sewer fund. We could codify that as some administrative policy for our sewer fund. That that's how it operates. I should ask the attorney that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's but it would seem like that could be a policy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would appreciate that because that was a huge reduction in the reserves, however, that could come back. I want to be able to continue my discussion at this point. Please. Thank you. And finally, finally, when you did your comparative rates, the example for Piedmont was on a property that was 5000 to 10000 square footage, which is'",
        "'speaker_1': ', I think, above our average. And did Piedmont have a rate for of residences that are below 5000. Because I think that is more apples to apples in Alameda. Most of our lots I don't think are 5000 to 10000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, there's a lower rate for Piedmont residents who are lower than that square footage that we could.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that should actually be substituted here so that we see what that rate is and that should what would be what we should be comparing. There are not very many lots in I think the average and maybe staff knows, but I would think the average lot is less than 5000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so since Piedmont has that lower rate, I'd like to substitute that for the rate that's here. And then I notice also the rate for Oakland includes a wasteful of 4055 gallons per month. And did you know is that what the average is for Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Waste the flow because that's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's. Yes. Because that's when you look at how you chose which numbers to use for our for comparison we had footnotes that spoke to Oakland's rate was based on this rate weighs for 4055 gallons and I don't know if that is the average.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, I think it's important that we're comparing apples to apples on our comparative on the comparison.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So each agency sets its typical residential rate based on the average flow or that service area. So each agency is a little bit different on how they define what a single family home is. So that's the most common rate charged for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I don't know if that translates to Alameda, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So each single family home, regardless, we don't actually if you're a single family home to be, we don't actually look at your water usage. It's assumed that you're going to use a certain amount and you charge the $23.23.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe that the city of Oakland does it the same. It's an assumption of what's called an equivalent dwelling unit. So we assume that each equivalent dwelling unit is going to use a certain amount of water and that 23, 23 is a sign it's for commercial where we actually start getting into flow based rates, where we will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get East Bay MUDs, water data and it is calculated based on that. So I think comparing a single family unit in Oakland to a single family unit in Alameda to a single family unit in Albany is apples to apples.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, in regards to Piedmont, it sounds like there is a lower rate that could be used, so I'd appreciate substituting that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, Piedmont whole structure is a little bit more unique than the rest. It's actually part of a tax over there, and I can't speak to the specifics of it, but certainly we can update the statistics. So it's more comparable to what we're presenting here for Alameda tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I appreciate that. Thank you. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Um, I, I think the the salient point about what we're being asked to vote on tonight is really contained in the first sentence of the staff report. The city is required by state law and city policy to collect revenues sufficient to cover the costs of operating the sewer facilities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And because of this lawsuit that we've just come out of and the consent decree under which we're operating, we must fund these certain minimum improvements to the sewer facilities over the next 20 years. But we can only go out in five year increments legally under Prop 218 to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While I appreciate all the work that's gone into this, and I think you both did a very nice job. I'm satisfied with the information that's laid out in your tables and your charts. I'm less concerned about how Oakland or Piedmont does their billing, because I know that in Alameda, our pipes are of a certain vintage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're old, and we've been doing a great job going around. You've probably seen the crews out in the street and we're, you know, using cameras and all this to see the condition. But we need to make sure that we're doing these repairs in a timely manner or we're going to end up in another lawsuit again and we're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going to end up spending even more money on litigation costs and fines. So I think this is fairly straightforward, and I don't know that that any council decisions are really needed to say, you know, offer a different way of looking at the different rates in Piedmont.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not sure that the council as a whole is really suggesting that. So anyway. Oh, and did we do that? We did do the vote to go past 11. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft, I appreciate the comment. One other unique factor for Alameda is how flat we are. We have 34 pump stations that are a significant capital investment that those that live in Oakland and others that have are blessed with gravity don't have to incur those costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'd like to I'm sorry, I'd like to speak to member Ashcroft's comments. I raised the issue because there is a chart on page 17 in this presentation that does refer to Piedmont and with a footnote that the service charges for flat lots, size 5000 to 10000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If there is a dollar amount that is more accurate, that is more similar to Alameda, I think it is appropriate to substitute that so that we are being clear with our residents. And so so this point, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think people need to understand that the lawsuit and the consent decree were because our pipes were spilling sewage instead of sending it to the the treatment center. And we do have to do this. I think it's been pointed out that we have pump stations that are big ticket items that we've bonded for and we paying for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in this early end, which accounts for the drop down of the fund balance is really not a reserve. It's the fund balance, correct? So with that being said, we have no choice regardless of what our comparables do. But to fund this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I move that we adopt the resolution as presented and get the process going so that we can have the hearings, so we can get public input, so that we can meet our requirements to provide sewer service and to meet the mandate of the consent decree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I second this in regards to discussion. So will this be this presentation will be shared with the public? Correct. So I would request that that charter in regards to Piedmont be modified. Where does the council where is the council on that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you making a motion?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Well, I'd like to know you apparently have concerns about modifying the chart to be accurate. So I'm hoping that other council members are agreeable to making that modification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can speak for myself. I know, I said. I think we have all the information we need before us in the charts, in the tables, in the footnotes. And I think we need to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate that. That's why I was asking if the other council members have a problem with that presentation being modified before it goes. So it's accurate for the residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My come on that topic, my comment would be, you know, any additional information is not going to hurt. I think what Mayor Spencer is getting at is just make sure that we're characterizing this as accurately as possible. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, get the additional information on Piedmont, from my perspective. But in terms of the larger picture, my perspective is also that. As you know, the 3% that you're programing coming for the next five years, that's a reasonable increase.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The reality is that council and the public really bit the bullet in 2011, 2012 and 2013 by doing the 14% increase just between those 14, 14, 14, accumulative, 42% increase. But now we're doing over a five year period, cumulative 15%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My caution would only be that sometimes it sounds too good to be true. I mean, if someone had to bite the bullet at 14% before, you know. You don't have to. Don't feel like you have to soft pedal the information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know you don't. You're not. But no. Because if the if the increase has to be higher than 3% and let us know. But but if that's your level best that that you think that that's what it is then then okay then I could live with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I realized that, you know, part of what? What? Feeds into the 3% increase is the fact that we're drawing down on the reserve. Had we not had a reserve and the amount that we've have it would have had it would have increased annual increases would have been would have had to be more than 3%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. But by the same token, I realize that that reserve, though, exists because. We've accumulated dollars for this purpose in which we have not expended well. So it's not a real reserve in the sense that, for example, when we talk about our general fund balance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. But but I think, you know, the additional information that Mayor Spencer is is asking for, I think it's. Sure, you know, let's let's gather it. But by the same token, I do think, though, that what's been presented here is reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, then, Brody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess I'm not convinced that there's something inaccurate in the original report, so. That's kind of where I am. And I think, you know, get back to the vice mayor's point again. You know, it's about the big picture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's about something we're obligated to do. Let's not lose sight of that. And in and spend a lot of time arguing about whether, you know, one person's interpretation of what a certain rate is versus another person's interpretation. Well, I don't do sewer rate studies as a living, so I guess I have to put a lot of trust'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor's Challenge for Safer Streets. Safer People. Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety Initiative. The challenge is a yearlong effort and begins on March 12th with a kick off event. And it requires the city to make a public statement about the importance of bicycling and walking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It also requires us to form a task force and to take part in seven challenge activities that are shown up there on your screen. The first one is to take a complete street approach. The second one is to remove barriers for all road users.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The third to collect data on bicycling and walking. The fourth to use best practices designs. Fifth, to implement bicycling and walking improvements with maintenance projects like resurfacing. And six out of the seven is to improve the laws and regulations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the last one is to educate and enforce road user behavior, working with the police department on that one. We're really fortunate in the timing of this challenge because the Public Works Department is just embarking on an update, a required update of both the pedestrian plans and the bicycle plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can easily fold this effort, this national effort, into our local effort that's required to update these plans. And we can use this as a national best practices checklist. And so we will be starting the work scopes of those updates next month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we don't foresee too much additional staff work on that on this effort at all. The questions and comments. I remember Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you for that update. I. I thought, too, when I read this and I know it was recently added to the agenda because we just got this information. But I thought it was great timing because we're just about to do the ribbon cutting on this fabulous shorelines cycle track project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I was just at a workshop that you led last week on the Cross Alameda Trail. And. But I did have the question in my notes about how much additional staff work and time and resources would be necessary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it sounds like. What did you say that that Public Works is about to embark on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That we're about to embark on on required updates for the bicycle plan? Okay. That was and also the pedestrian plan to the bicycle plan was update was back in 2010. So it's required every five years. And then the pedestrian plan was back in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And and I would just like to say that I would certainly want to see Miss Payne as a key member of this effort, because she is so knowledgeable and has been at the forefront of some really great projects we've been doing for bicycles and pedestrians in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think you did mention the police department because that was also my thought about the educating and enforcing proper road behavior would need to get law enforcement in on that. So other than that, I think this is really exciting.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The top three are things that I think are supposed to happen and then you do as much of the challenge activities as you can. You're not expected. You don't have to do them all. And it's not as so they'll be following up and seeing if we in fact are able to do all of these, but that we'",

        "'speaker_1': 'When when I read that, I think we do need council approval to sign up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I agree that we need council's approval. I would certainly not want to see us limiting our goals before we've even begun, because I, quite frankly, think we're capable of doing all of them. So I think you you start out and you set your sights high.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I have a feeling we've already done more than three of these and, you know, probably aren't that far away from doing all seven. So I think Alameda is equal to the challenge. Let's do it all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have a motion to the motion members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just wanted a quick comment, you know, kind of second. What was their second to the motion? No, I'll do that. But then also I continue my comment. Councilmember Asker We can't just say we're going to do this and give lip service, do that to this.'",

It just seems kind of kind of silly if if we're not going to actually go, you know, full in 100% of this.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So the way that I'm framing this is, as is indicated in the summary, is basically being a sounding board for the city manager as he goes about or she or he goes about preparing the city budget. In a way it kind of ties in with where city treasurer Kevin Kearney said earlier tonight when he indicated that perhaps'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there should be involvement ahead of time when, when, when the Budget is 90% done. I mean by the time it comes to city council for draft, I mean, it's, it's almost there. We just have to make the policy choices as council members.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And the other particular thing that I'm interested in is also a charter. Having it having an institutionalized way that says there is a group of people who are also a sounding board when it comes to our unfunded liabilities, particularly CalPERS and OPEB.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the city manager has he discussed the trust fund idea? And we've also taken on a preliminary basis, there's been some initial concepts that that illustrate how the trust fund idea in terms of dealing with OPEB can get dealt with over a 20 to 30 year period, well beyond the time that I'm on council or beyond'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Secondly, no, in all seriousness, I have a personal preference that if we're going to have new commissions that, you know, each council member gets an opportunity to appoint someone to that commission, because I think we all bring a diverse background, diverse views, and I think a diverse group of supporters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that that would help if we do do something like this. I guess I'm kind of wondering, you know, kind of how this is different than will a the budget process be the council's ultimate responsibility to be the decision maker on these things?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And I think back in. In front of that approval. They have something that is codified either as a practice or as part of our budget process that accomplishes what's outlined in Task C is very important. So I think that that's a very good point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether this is a charter committee, I think the notion of charter is to make sure that it's it's there and it's constantly being looked at. I'm not sure of an. I guess. I don't know what other cities our size.'",

Given the times, but I'd like to see us at least address this as as a council, this this check on these unfunded liabilities.'",

A significant step. And again, yeah, are there other ways to achieve the same objectives, which I think are laudable, by the way, and I really appreciated hearing from the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'city Treasurer earlier this evening. We do need to keep our eye on those very important balls are unfunded liabilities in our and OPEB, but to the point made by the City Treasurer, adding even more meetings for the public to have to keep up with and attend is not necessarily increasing transparency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, sometimes it's just the opposite because the public has a hard time keeping up with all of our meetings as it is. And I also look at the amount of staff time that is required every time we add a new a new task force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that or committee or commissioner or what have you and I think there's something in here about that could meet twice a quarter. And ultimately, this is, as we said, the role of the city council. I think that it's a great idea to get these issues out before us, as the city treasurer alluded to, sooner'",
        "'speaker_2': 'than when 90% of the work in the budget is done. I think that's something the council can, through the city manager direct to be done. I'm asked staff to do. I think the the process described would be time consuming require extra staff time in duplicate a function already performed by the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't always convene an ad hoc committee similar to the OPEB task force, which may be. And if that's different now, that is different from the Fiscal Sustainability Committee. So we've done this in the past, and I think that bringing together those kinds of task forces or committees that are tailored to a particular need at a particular'",
        "'speaker_2': 'time is more effective than something as extreme as a charter amendment that fixes it for all time. So why I again laud the the objectives that are are laid out in this council referral? I think that that's something that all of us on the council should pay special attention to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'd love to see these issues come to us well ahead of the budget. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm really sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, thank you. I think everyone's comments are taken to heart. I do think that the magnitude of the challenge that we have with regard to our unfunded liabilities is some of which is $200 million, $100 million on the OPEB side and $100 million on the CalPERS side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm not even including the unfunded liabilities when it comes to capital improvement. I think the magnitude of the challenges and the long term solutions that we will put in place, especially for OPEB, requires, in my opinion, a charter change so that we can have a vehicle to track this over time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I mean, the voters will, one way or another, vote on this. And also, I think the magnitude of the. Of just our budget as the city council. We've got not only the $75 million general fund budget, but we have all our other non general fund items and you know, annually we're dealing with it a quarter of'",
        "'speaker_3': '$1,000,000,000 budget. I think the magnitude of what we're dealing with requires at a minimum. Additional community input. So in my mind, this ranks up there as being a charter type of committee. Along with a library commission or the or the planning commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there will likely be a vote on this in the chart. So whether we decide on this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I appreciate that. And I and I do appreciate the goal here of it's my understanding that staff is planning to have a workshop about the budget.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Share with us what the process is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly. So actually we have I'm just pulling up the schedule right now. We have six meetings planned, the first two. The first is sort of an introduction of the process. The second is introducing the preliminary budget, including assumptions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that would be the time that I'd suggest that we include early on the discussion of OPEB, CalPERS and maintenance. So that would be the second meeting. Then the next three meetings are our departments doing their departmental presentations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The final meeting, which is roughly in the early, early.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'June, is adoption of the budget. So we're looking at a total of six working meetings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you have dates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'March 17th to June 2nd?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are any of these would any of these be a special meeting like on a Saturday, which is what I believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have right now tentatively.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Three regular meetings and three special meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The special meetings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are during the week. We're not planning on having them on the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that would be something that I would be interested in trying to do a Saturday morning meeting to if we or some other time so that to include different members of the public because I do appreciate the concern of making sure our public is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That we're very transparent about what we're doing and including the public. And I'm so so maybe that would be another way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To tell if we talk about one of those weekdays.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exactly. Exactly. Instead of a. But these are be like Tuesdays or Thursdays.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I know the dates. Yes. One is the one is a Thursday. One is a Wednesday. And then one is a Tuesday in an opposite week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my only concern about Saturdays is I think families with children are. I mean, I remember when hours were home, you're just going from activity to activity. So I hate to. I hate to. Leaves them out. I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hear the same thing about evening meetings that, you know, only certain people can come that parents can't because they're doing homework or babysitting or whatnot. So I was just thinking a choice so we could have some on the which we already have evening meetings on weekdays if anyone else is interested in making a different time'",
        "'speaker_1': 'available for different members of the community to be able to attend.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But of course, this would be a special meeting, so there's nothing else on the agenda, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right. That's right. The special will and we can bring this back so that you all have the dates in front of you and then we can talk about it. But the first two meetings were regular meetings on Tuesday evenings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The special meetings were actually the individual presentations by the departments. So you would want to have one of those on a Saturday because they're not going to be able to hear the whole budget. You're only going to hear, let's say, police and, you know, a few departments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So those special meetings are just departmental meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just a few of the departments will be going each time. And then the adoption of the budget is we're proposing that to be the beginning of June. So June.'",
        "'speaker_7': '2nd.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then in regards to Mr. Kennedy also brought up the certain slides. Be always part of the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. Duly noted. Yeah, they will be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So then that I think goes to the slides are in regards to the capital projects, summary unfunded projects, the CalPERS rates, projected increases in rates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I, you know, I mean, don't get me wrong, I understand the the substance and the process by which we deal with the issue, the budget issues from time to time, whether it's through, you know, workshops on Saturdays or or weekends or whether it's through the normal channels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This really is kind of independent. This is about creating a lasting institution. And to me, this is a missing piece. So from my vantage point, I mean, I would like to go out and collect signatures and and try to put this on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I we'll leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So so then we're going to move forward. All right. So then we have our next agenda item nine B.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What was the what was the outcome of this? If it's tabled. Is that what you're saying? Now, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mean. Well, I bet I would prefer that that that it be moved forward, but it's being tabled. So I will move it forward on my own.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, there is no motion. Okay, got it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if I may, just technically it should be described as withdrawn. If it's tabled mean it's coming back and it has to come back by a date certain. Call it if you like. If I may suggest to the council member the chair that you consider it withdrawn and you can say withdrawn at this time, but I think'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that'll be cleaner in the minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I prefer not to withdraw it, so. What would be the cleanest way to. Well, then I would make a motion to to pass to adopt the recommendation. And if it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then it's. But that's different from tabling it when it's tabled, my understanding. And it could come back at a later date. Sounds like you don't want to eat that way. You'd rather make the motions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. All right. All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So there's a motion. Is there a second? Motion fails for lack of a second, and then we move forward with 9090. Thank you. You.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And I it's probably somewhat ironic or not that we're hearing this almost at midnight. I was concerned about meetings going long and maybe lacking direction earlier on. And so I went back and I did a little research into the whole council referral process and how an item is placed on an agenda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I learned that indeed another council back in 2007 brought this very issue of who could place an item, who and how place is an item on the agenda. And what I found is that that job really belongs to the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But a council member could bring a referral, could do a council referral to place an agenda on the item. And then it is simply up to their colleagues to decide whether or not or what to do about that proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in fact, in going back and doing my research, I would think that the attachment is familiar to at least one member of this council, because the Vice Mayor was a member of the council at that time.

And lastly, the Council referral process makes no distinction between the mayor and other council members placing an item on the agenda.'",

So, you know, I think there are two issues. The first issue is agenda raising the matter, which is what is at the heart of this right now, this discussion.'",

However, no council member individual has the authority to direct the city manager to do a certain thing, a certain way if it's under operations. And.

There was a 30 day period to take action and and I would actually suggest at some point that that be looked at in regards to if any council member thinks that there's something that comes up that we're not paying attention to for whatever'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, I think I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think that's the key word in the referral process. If you notice, it's not a direct staff, but it's direct manager. So that the referral was to prevent spurious direction from. Opinion from a single council member. Regardless it is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when there was a direction and having to do with operation or expenditure that would come a majority vote of the council that was that was at the root. Of. Setting this up and the referral form the way it is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make it clear, though, I think what I'm trying to defend, the argument that I'm trying to defend is and I could be wrong, but if there has in the past and I'm not I don't just mean with the manager, Russo and the previous mayor, Mary Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't get that. I mean, many, many city managers, if there have been, has been a deference given to by the city manager to requests made by the mayor so long as it was reasonable. And it didn't require any kind of, you know, going through the the the the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Whether the process was the one that was said in 2007 or the process that was put in place per the ordinance that's already in there, that that specifies that we have to turn something in at Monday at 5:00, blah, blah, blah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If that difference has been there, I'm arguing that I don't think that we should now do away with that difference. If at some point in time it becomes unreasonably overbearing, then, you know, that's why I say, you know, I have all trust that this city manager and any future city manager would say, you know what, I'm out'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And they would first say that to the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I could address that, you know, we spent a lot of time on this council talking about transparency and allowing the public to understand what we do when we when we take action and the the tradition of deference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I you know, I don't dispute that it's been there is not something that was voted by this body and it is not something that you will find written down or, you know, could search for in the city's archives or on the website.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we are better served as a body and we serve the public that we that elected us better when we are a council that adheres to rules and regulations that are in place. And three of us on this body are attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we understand the concept of stare decisis, roughly translated to what let the decision stand. And it doesn't have to be a unanimous decision, of course. So I feel that what I'm trying to do is make. Bring attention to this procedure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That, again, has already been. Approved by a previous council and for all intents and purposes has been in place. And especially now, as we're starting out the new council, we have a lot before us with some very substantive issues that are coming before us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want to make sure that we're using our staff's time and also the public's time with meetings and agendas that they have to sit through and listen to. We want to make sure that we're we're doing that judiciously and prudently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, again, as as the mayor pointed out, I think we all would agree with her. There is nothing that would keep any of us from going to the city manager and saying, Mr. City Manager, there is an issue I think is important and should come before the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What do you think? And trust me, he'll he he's he's a very wise, experienced man with a lot of depth of experience in city government and was formerly a city attorney. He'll he'll he'll listen to us. And I, you know, so I don't think in that regard any, you know, any special requests that anybody had as long'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as, again, that it's operational and it's within reason can still be addressed. So I don't think we're foreclosing anyone from from taking that course of action. But at this point in time, I'm ready to call for the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Their motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will move that the city council adhere to the Council referral process adopted by the City Council on December four, 27, as referenced in my Council referral.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My my discussion quickly is one, we had a similar issue way back in 1997. And while it wasn't involving the mayor at the time, it was involving a city council member. And issues like this arise from time to time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess something happened in 2007 that led to that. My sense is that there are two incidences that are leading to this issue being discussed tonight. From my interpretation, I don't I don't I don't see them as defining moments that the system is broken, quite frankly, in terms of the first item, it was just one of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'those odd things, you know, you just had to do it in terms of the second item. I do believe it is a city's city mayors prerogative to to call special meetings. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, you might say there are two strikes. I. I'm not seeing these strikes. I mean, I have no vested interest to defend this. But I do feel like that that that this is, you know, a an issue of mayoral prerogative and an issue of the council's relationship relative to that and to the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and the practice that I've seen in the past, the deference that I do believe had been given in the past, I see no reason why that ought not to be continue. And I think we can all agree that, you know, so long as, you know, we proceed reasonably.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'BRODY You know, and to kind of give the flip side, you know, I'm not here to attack Mayor Spencer, but I'm concerned that, you know, we have this process in place and I think it's worked. We had the referral on the Park District and collaborating and we had a really robust discussion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We gave staff directions. They came back with a resolution that that fit exactly what we wanted to do. And the idea got fleshed out. We all had an opportunity to weigh in and discuss it, and I think we can be very proud of the end product.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The same thing with the you know, the traffic idea. The traffic study idea. Now, I'm not quite exactly sure it was the exact same idea that, you know, it may not be the same that you envision it when you first put in the referral councilman or de song.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But, you know, I think the amount of time that staff has put into it and and given thought to it and researched it and looked at all the different studies that have been out there, you know, I think we're going to have a really quality product that we can all be proud of when we're done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that, you know, that's I like that process. I think that process works, you know, when we still don't have, you know, the vice mayor brought up, again, a rules committee. You know, I think if if that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Meaning. While I do Grant, the mayor has the project to call a special meeting. Yes, that's true. But I think if we'd been able to go through a more thorough discussion during the council referral period and give staff some direction, you know, we might have, you know, some actual concrete action items that we could discuss like a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'rules committee and some other agenda change ideas and things like that. So I guess I'm concerned that as Councilmember Ashcraft stated about the transparency and I, I got an email a couple of weeks ago about from a Sunshine Committee member, you know, wanting to decrease the amount of of notice that the city gives for our agenda item'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So I guess I'm just concerned that if one person can put a not fully vetted item on the agenda and we're moving towards, you know, a discussion of, you know, contracting our transparency instead of expanding our transparency that, you know, we're not going to get the best ideas and we're not going to get them that are not'",
        "'speaker_6': 'fully baked and we're not going to get them that, you know, that the public has a real opportunity to discuss. So I mean, I, I do think maybe this is something we try on a trial basis. And, you know, if we want to revisit it in six months and revisit it in a year, you know, I think'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that would be a good idea. And if we say, well, it's kind of stupid, you know, we don't need that, or we say, yes, it's working, you know, let's let's keep it in place. But, you know, I I'm fully open to having some, you know, time limit on it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As we all know, start to get used to each other and learn how to work together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This information the. Was adopted. 27 did not. The mayor calling a special meeting, that is. I remember. That special meetings were called by the mayor after the. Bay is just reaffirming. We already have on the books. Of course, I'd like to cover the question after hearing your comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All those in favor. I suppose I. I suppose so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I suppose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. Three, two, two. A motion carries. And did you want to explain your proposition?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did. Okay. So he explained, I will be opposing because I think that it's unfortunate that this was brought. I think that I have been afforded the same courtesies by the city managers were afforded to the prior mayor. And I think that a review of the referrals by the prior mayor make it clear that that was in fact'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the practice. So I would submit that it's unfortunate that I am being afforded a different respect from council members than the prior mayor. And with that, I will. Oh, actually, I think there's more on the agenda. Council Communications Number ten.'"
