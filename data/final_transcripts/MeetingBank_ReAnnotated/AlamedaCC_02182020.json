    "Amendment to Agreement and Annual Report from Centro Legal de la Raza for Tenant Legal Services.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, Debbie Porter, you there you are. Do you want to come up and give a brief overview and then we'll hear from if it's okay with council, we'll hear from the public speakers and then we'll make our comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Council Mayor. I'm Debbie Potter, the community development director for the city. And the item before you this evening is a recommendation to approve a First Amendment to our agreement with a central league out to provide legal assistance to low income tenants.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This was a contract that was approved in November of 2018. It was approved as a three year contract. It was funded for a total amount of $500,000, with the funding spread pretty much in equal parts across three years, about $166,000 per year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Last year, the first year of the contract was from November of 2018 to November of 2019. And at the conclusion of the first year of the contract staff, primarily myself and Michael Rausch from the City Attorney's Office, sat down with central legal staff to discuss how the first year had been, how they felt about their work scope'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and the service delivery. And based on the annual report, some of the quarterly reporting and conversations with staff, it was decided by both central legal staff as well as city staff, that it probably made sense to renegotiate the work scope for this current year of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The second year of the three year contract staff is not recommending any additional funding or reduction in funding. Essentially, we're recommending a reallocation of funds with a revised work scope. The primary change is to modify the work scope so that there is a reduction in the number of folks served for the legal services to reduce that number'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and to reallocate funding for two general activities one to increase the budget for outreach. There have been some challenges in reaching some of the tenants. Low income tenants in Alameda. So Centro is proposing to do more robust outreach in this upcoming year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then there is a recommendation to reallocate funds for an emergency financial assistance program. And that is a program that central legal has been running countywide. And in the city of Oakland since December of 2018. And Alameda tenants have been able to take advantage of that emergency financial assistance via Centro's contract with the county.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That contract is set to expire in May of this year, and there is not yet a guarantee from the county whether that contract will be extended. And so the proposal is to augment those services and fund those services directly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In the city of Alameda, Alameda tenants have been the sink, the second highest users of this emergency financial assistance under the county contract. And it has been a great resource for keeping tenants in their homes and keeping tenants from becoming homeless.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that is a program that that Centro thinks that it can put to really good use in this upcoming year of of the contract. So that that's kind of a high level overview of what the recommendation is and what staff is recommending.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I am happy to answer any questions after public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have any clarifying questions about the staff report? Okay. Hearing that we'll move to. But did you have something.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Else to say? Sorry. And I did want to point out that Monique Berlanga, the directing attorney, and Teresa Gonzalez, the executive director of Central Legal, are here this evening and they are available to to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Let's go to our public speakers, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Terri Johansen and Kathryn Polley.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You have to boil it down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor and Council. I would once again like to commend this mayor and this council for everything that you've done for renters in Alameda. I am a renter and I'm speaking tonight as a renter. I do feel like the renters have been one of the most vulnerable in our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with the efforts of this mayor and council, we have done a lot to protect people and to keep them in their homes and to thereby reduce the homeless population. That's just escalating. I think these changes of of reaching out to more community members and to offering them more services, especially the assistance when they need it, I'",
        "'speaker_2': 'think is a is a great expansion of the protection and the parachute. If you're going to go sailing at 100 miles an hour, the parachute and the safety net that you all have provided. So I, I commend you all for all of the protections you have have afforded our renters and hope this continues in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Pike.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to add my appreciation to Cherise. I think you all have been doing tremendous work on so many different levels regarding Central Ago. What we are hearing since Jessica's evictions came into effect is we are getting a lot more calls, a lot more questions, not just about habitability, but about buildings being sold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I feel that now that we have just cause protections, tenants seem more willing to come out and talk about it. And the next step is, if things are advancing or complicated, we will be doing more room for referrals to Centro Legal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you for having this program in place. I feel like there's a lot of progress being made and it's going to be a tremendous help to the tenants there. The changes mentioned, I think, are smart. I know that a lot of Alameda residents excuse me, a lot of Alameda residents have drawn on that Alameda County money'",
        "'speaker_5': 'through central legal. So that is a very positive step and to make sure that that that is continued to keep people housed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have one more and one more speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lana, is Sheena.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Misery Sheena.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor and City Council. I also want to thank you for having this program in place. My father was the one who benefited from this program, and unfortunately he's not here. But if he were, he would have said the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. This program is very important. And now that the city made changes to the city laws to protect the tenants, it is crucial to have this help because the law will be meaningless if there is nobody to implement it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one thing I want to say in favor of De La Rosa is our personal experience with them. First of all, they're very knowledgeable about the issues on the island. They know the ordinance and know what's going on and they are available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are other places like, say, for example, illegal. They're very good, but they are overwhelmed. And today, the housing situation is such that all this housing services, advocacy groups, they are tremendously overwhelmed. And tenants on the island have a resource like De La Raza.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then they have that resource available to them. Sorry. And that's number one. Number two, is that having that program in place facilitates settlements. Because anytime I used to do pro-bono advocacy in San Francisco years ago, and my experience with that was any time a tenant shows up to a court house with a lawyer, then usually 90% of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the time they woke up settling. And this is one of the things that we need. And with the crisis, with the homeless crisis driving people out of their home, we really need this kind of help. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I hope that you support this program and this program will continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Recine. Okay. That's all of our public speakers. I'm actually going to lead off because I was one of the ones, and then I'll turn it over to you. Councilmember Desai and I wrote a long email this morning to Debbie Potter, and you did get back to me this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I support in concept the program and the having an agreement with Centro Legal de la Raza. My problem is with some of the amendments. So we know from the scope of services and from what the reason that the council voted in 2018 to allocate a half a million dollars, $500,000 over three years, $166,666 each year to El'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Centro to the center. The was to provide legal services to low income tenants to reduce the risk of displacement. And certainly those of us who work often in the housing arena and working hard to combat our housing crisis know that the best way to address homelessness is not to let it happen in the first place, and that's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'why things like the emergency funds are so helpful. But my concern with these proposed changes are threefold. One of them is Centro Legal has come back and said essentially after the first year, you know, we just didn't reach as many people as we thought we would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So pay us the same amount of money while we reduce the number of legal consultations by 5%, the number of clients served by 25%, legal representation by 50%, and providing housing stabilization strategies by 33%. And there is a proposal to include, over the course of two years, $55,000 of city money for this emergency financial assistance that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we heard Ms.. Porter speak about, which has up till now been provided by county funds. But those funds look like they're going to go away in May of this year. So certainly good to have the ability to supplant those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel that whenever we're taking money from the general fund, we want to make sure that it's well spent. And as an attorney, not actively practicing now, but if I were bidding on a contract for services, I would be looking at the number of clients we expected to serve, the number of attorneys, paralegals, staff, time it takes'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But now, with this reduction in still wanting to be paid the same amount, I I'm I'm uncomfortable with that. But another concern I had in reading your annual report is that Centro Legal has no Asian language proficiency. In fact, they stated that in their first year they learned from outreach that Alameda has a high.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Relation high Asian population, many of whom are non-English speaking well around Alameda. It's a pretty well-known fact that our population is anywhere from 33%, maybe even higher. Asian Pacific Islanders. And I was surprised to read that Central. They didn't know that until they did their initial outreach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in the the annual report, it was stated that additional funding beyond current contract amounts would be required to conduct a needs assessment for those communities, the Asian Speaking Communities to determine best program designed to address their specific legal needs and elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It said in the report that. But, you know, we can probably just deal with them using a translator over the phone. That bothers me, because for English speaking and probably Spanish speaking clients, they would get a person to person consultation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if you're Asian speaking, you're going to be talking over the phone with a translator. I just think you're very vulnerable, as are two tenant representative. And as mentioned, you're very vulnerable. And so we want to make sure we're giving you the best representation possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My modification to this agreement would be okay if you're going to keep the $500,000 over three years, but you're telling us already you're serving less clients. I would expect central legal to bring in Asian speaking interpreters to actually I mean, who are trained to actually work with folks rather than saying, oh, you can just use our phone'",
        "'speaker_0': 'translation service, that that's unacceptable for me. And then the third concern I have is the clinic locations and hours are not helpful for working people and those with limited mobility. So in the staff report, we read that legal consultation services at Central Legal's location are just over the Fruitvale Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those services are provided again in the Fruitvale District every Tuesday at 9 a.m.. If you were on a weekly basis or once a month at Mastic, which is in Alameda from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.. Well, in my email to Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Potter, I said that formula is backwards. Central Legal should be in Alameda once a week. And I would propose I don't want to micromanage, but I would propose at a set location whether it's the first Tuesday, the month that mastic, the second Tuesday at our midpoint collaborative the third at the library that you should serve Alameda residents'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in Alameda because not everyone is able to hop on the bus there and get there. There are there are, you know, physical limitations sometimes. But also the fact that the clinics and the services are only offered weekday mornings is troublesome because for working people, you wouldn't be able to I mean, many working people would not be able'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to take time off to go and seek this legal consultation. And so, as I said, that, you know, legal representation is only effective if you can access it. So I and I know Ms.. Potter, when she responded, said that, well, they tried and they just didn't get much response at their clinics in Alameda, but now they're proposing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to do more outreach. So I would say in that outreach, tell people that you'll be in Alameda every week. And secondly, it was stated that, well, you know, they do a lot of phone consultations and find that those are sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, phone consultations for half a million dollars for three years, that that seems kind of steep to me. So I want to provide this legal representation, but I want it to be effective. And so, again, for the reasons that I've stated, unless we can make modifications, I can't support this in Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know you also wanted to pull this item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, thank you. I just have some questions. Perhaps staff can respond or or the service provider. So my questions are as follows In what way does the service provider ensure that it is pursuing only those legal cases after examining both renter and land small landlords perspective?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In other words, next question How does the service provider guard against situations where they are, where they are not getting the full picture from a client? I mean, what are what are the internal procedures in place? Policies, procedures that make sure that they get the full picture.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So central legal. Their first recourse, essentially, or their first approach is to to talk with both the landlord and the tenant and see if they can negotiate a resolution and to not have that the issue at hand end up in court.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And they did inform me that they have not yet initiated a single litigation against a single landlord in Alameda, but rather they've been very effective working to negotiate solutions without the need to the recourse of going to court so that as part of that process, there is a fact finding process where they are able to speak with'",
        "'speaker_10': 'both the landlord and the tenant and then evaluate the veracity of what both sides are saying. So that's their process, and they have not yet brought any litigation against any landlord.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have not brought any litigation against landlords, but they have written letters to landlords. Is that correct? On behalf of tenants?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm. Yes, they yes, they have. And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, will it be necessary? Would it be helpful? Are you saying the same thing I was?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Council Mayor Ashcraft. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you want to introduce yourself. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry. My name is Monique Berlanga. I'm the directing attorney of the tenants rights practice at Centro Legal de la Rosa. And I want to thank everybody for the questions. These are all very good questions, things that we've been examining internally as well in terms of how we are delivering services under the program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In response to your specific question about how do we make sure that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, if you have internal procedures or policies that institutionalizing the fact finding phase? Sure. I am aware of some small landlords who just received a letter that kind of took their presumptive position that. The landlord was wrong. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Without having. Really? Interviewed the landlord or gathered the facts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would say that there are there are different levels of services we provide. We often at our clinics provide consultation services. We can help tenants who may not be able to write letters themselves, write letters to their landlords.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that's different from when we enter into a legal representation. When we enter into a legal representation and retain a tenant for services, we're definitely going to investigate the facts before we agree to provide any type of litigation related or long, longer extended services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hope that answers your questions. But in a brief drop in clinic, often, you know, we don't have that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think. The thing that I would encourage is that, um, perhaps as that you create internal policies and procedures that if you're communicating with whomever, that you indicate that this is not a leak, you know, this is not, as you said, a legal situation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, a so that when a landlord gets a letter, they understand that while it might come from, from your organization or with the assistance of staff from your organization, that there is a difference between. This is a legal letter that says, hey, you've done something wrong and we're going to try to fix it through the courts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that there's a process by which it is clearly indicated that that this is. I know this is a non-legal or information gathering phase. Sure. Yeah. Um, because I have, I do know of landlords who have received letters and who felt like what you know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the bigger picture is they felt like they were the big picture. Their perspective was not taken into account. Yeah. Um, so, um. That that's what I would encourage. Is that, um. That you'd be more clear because, you know, there are small landlords in town for whom it is difficult to wage their own legal case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not like everyone has, you know, a bundle of money to pay lawyers. So I think a little sensitivity on that part is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So so one other thing I'd like to mention in terms of our model and and what we do for tenants, which kind of goes hand-in-hand with the modifications we're proposing tonight, is we really pride ourselves in intervening early before a situation gets to the point of eviction, which is why we are proposing a reduced number of eviction'",
        "'speaker_1': ', defense representations and more informational tenant education outreach efforts. A lot of what I'm finding when I go to Mastic and I conduct these clinics is tenants coming in and saying, Can you help me interpret my lease? Or I'm starting to have this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How can I de-escalate this issue with my landlord? What are some options I may have? What are my rights? Their rights? And we're able to intervene early at that stage or refer them to the rent board for mediation or whatever it may be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would say that that's that's where we're trying to focus at this point, is more collaborative efforts. But then again, we do have duties to clients to to enforce their rights and to help them provide notice as provided by the law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I hear I hear what you're saying. And we do take we are very, very careful before we enter into a full legal representation to make sure we invest all the facts, investigate all the facts. But it does put us in a little bit of a difficult situation when we do have to often take attendance words for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what their experiences.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I see this woman. You would. Would you like. Are you also from Central Park?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because my colleagues are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So is that where you're standing up to be supportive or did you want to speak? You know, if you're going to speak and please speak into the microphone and introduce yourself, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I'm Katie Guimond.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to need to look closer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I'm Katie Guimond. I'm ah, research and policy analyst at Central Go. And I just wanted to make sure that I'm available for questions. I didn't have anything specific on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. And then I do have a question from Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you think it's just to stay up or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know. It depends on the question. Is it discretionary question?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Both.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I hear my colleague's concern regarding the language issues I used to be when I started my legal career I worked in for a nonprofit law firm. I think that it's always difficult to find the balance between the informational sessions versus the, you know, the one on one client time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am wondering if maybe there's a way to create some sort of program to do a by appointment in Alameda where you can schedule with the language line, that sort of thing, or get an interpreter available once you've made arrangements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think that that might meet the needs of, you know, having the drop in hours, but also having a space within that area or working with staff to find a space where you could have meetings in Alameda with clients so that they don't have to go off island with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With respect, if you're referring to my concern with an interpreter on the line, I know that that would not satisfy my my concerns. So I would like an in-person.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I'm saying that it would allow them. My question is whether they could make arrangements to allow sometimes you can't get an interpreter to physically come in depending on the language or the dialect or language. Sometimes you have to make arrangements to have a call in.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But if there's a space, I think one of your other concerns was having, you know, accessibility for people in Alameda. And my question was, if there's a way to kind of carve out space for these one on one meetings, also potentially in Alameda where people can schedule, because I hear the concern also regarding the times, but sometimes'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it's a matter of making yourself available for a scheduled appointment. And I know people often don't like to go to the to the drop in hours because they don't know if they're going to have to wait to see somebody and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so if there's a process that they can go about scheduling that and schedule it, perhaps here in Alameda as opposed to going to the offices, and they can make arrangements for any sort of language if they have a language preference, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what that would look like, what you do for other contracts where you have language barriers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I think that's a great idea. I think so. Speaking of other contracts, we administer several different entities, placement contracts in other jurisdictions. And as this this contract is evolving, our other contracts are evolving similarly as well. Things start in pilot and as you learn to see a community's needs, you're often modifying as you go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would I think that's a great idea. In terms of the appointments, I don't think it would be a great use of our resources to have weekly drop in clinics necessarily. I don't I think an appointment based system would work pretty well, particularly given the timelines we're dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A three day notice is a tenant may not be able to wait till the next drop in clinic. And what do they do? They call us and that is what we end up often doing, is making an individual appointment with them or, you know, giving them the advice over phone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or if a tenant has an unlawful detainer, they have a five day response time, you know, having a set day. There will always be tenants who need services in the interim. And I think we are definitely open to some to a model like that where we are doing phone consultations but then setting up blocks of time within'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alameda to meet with tenants face to face where we can if we have, you know, a volunteer interpreter potentially or an interpreter, we hire in a certain dialect present, but if not, then we can use the language line.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wish we could have staff who speak every dialect and every language that's available in Alameda. I don't know. You know, we can we can reach out to our banks for clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did not ask that. Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, no. I know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was Chinese specifically. And I'm not asking for interpreters for every language spoken in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Even within Chinese, though, we find that there are many different dialects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think my colleague had some good suggestions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Definitely. I think that's something we're open to. And we, you know, we are also are open to talking with every council member about what their ideas might be for different locations, different sites, different groups. We can reach out to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are. We're happy to spend as much time on the island as works for tenants. That's why we've proposed to outreach community engagement. We want people to know we're here or services are available. We'd like to come out to community groups and do outreach education workshops.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those type of services definitely broke into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember villages to have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then a couple other things I think working with. We do have a tenants group working with them. I think it is important to have drop in some some drop in hours scheduled, maybe not every week, but coordinating with them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They have monthly meetings and things like that. So perhaps you can coordinate with them to get the word out about it or with the housing authority as well. I think it's helpful to have that available to folks. And then there is the other question I had is your materials make?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are they do we have them in some of the known languages here in Alameda that there have been requests, some of the standard informational letters or fax, getting it translated in to Mandarin or Cantonese or other dialects that we know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have a large population with the need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. We've in the budget modification attached to the annual report we have in excuse me, requested increased outreach materials funding so that we can contract for translation and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that but that specific to getting translated materials and fake use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. That that would be that would be a use of this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then, you know, just and I know we have a diverse group of opinions up here. I certainly appreciate the fact that you're contracting with us to preserve to to provide a certain amount of advocacy for a specific group.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so sometimes that means sending out letters where you're acting as the representative of that individual, where they might feel like they don't have a voice. You're giving them that voice. And I think that's a very important role that you're playing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's personally why I'm very supportive of this contract and the services that are provided. I think it's it's necessary. And oftentimes it does bring people to the table to prevent further stress on on either side and make sure that everybody is abiding by the laws and ordinances that we've set forth in the protections to make sure'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that it's a level playing field. So I know that you've provided that service, and I thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who's next? Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Again, thanks for providing the service. I just want to make sure we're clear that, you know, your services are legal services and they're governed by the business and professions code. Right? So attorneys are by nature and by law, you know, not the finder of fact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When there's a dispute in facts. And just because there's a dispute doesn't mean the landlord is right. So your job is to represent the tenants and be their advocate. And if there is a dispute, that could end up going to a court.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's not the job of you all to decide, you know, who's right, who's wrong. It's to zealously zealously advocate for your client, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is correct. And we take that duty very seriously.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I just want to make sure nobody expects that if you go to get an advocate for you, that they're going to end up, you know, proving the the other side's position. So, I mean, I look at the numbers, what, 62.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if 14% were API, that's nine, right? So do we know the languages of these nine nine folks that we're classifying? Well, we serve 60 to 62 people. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Are you an exhibit?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think I'm in the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you read the report? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We served 60 to 60 legal consultations, five four scope representations, total of 62 and duplicated clients. 14% were API. It is that so that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't have those numbers in front of me in terms of language?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess I'd be curious to know because I mean, are four big AAPI groups, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and I think Korean is next. So I mean, there's not a tremendous number of languages that you need to have people available on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it does kind of bother me that, you know, almost 10% of the folks that are four, 15%, one in seven that come to you, you know, may not speak the language. And that you know, I mean, when the mayor pointed it out, we're actually getting less for the same amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And now we have to pay for this, in addition, which seems to be kind of a deficiency in the current arrangement, it seems to me that you might be able to work with us on that. And, you know, maybe, you know, on the second point, you know, maybe coming every week is not feasible for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, there has to be something maybe in the middle. I mean, can you address some of the the things that the mayor had a concern on and maybe tell us some of those that you might be able to, you know, to help us with?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, but I am concerned about the language. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're looking those numbers up right now so we can tell you what percentage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while you're looking those numbers up, I would just add I was making notes in the margin that I don't know. I mean, we could help connect you with members of our Asian API community. I'm thinking of Alice Ly Becher, a former community county supervisor who's very well besides being native born, you know, from Hong Kong herself'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But she's, she's a fluent speaker and she's very tied in with the AAPI community. There are many others too, who because I just fear that there's the numbers you serve. But there might have even been more that had the need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But they didn't know if you didn't have materials in their languages. So I thank you, Councilmember Odie, for highlighting that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I mean, are, you know, one of our elected officials Filipino. Another one is is Chinese. There's the Asian Law Caucus. I mean, there's a number of resources that, you know, you could presumably find a translator that wouldn't charge, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over the roof or whatever the term is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, definitely. And I want to clarify that. I don't think it's been a problem for us in our service provision of providing services in LA, in other languages. My concern is I think there are communities who don't know about the availability of our services, which is where these types of connections which we hope that you all can'",
        "'speaker_1': 'help us with. And you know, as you mentioned, we do have many partner agencies who can help us with the translation of materials. But our number one concern has been is focusing our efforts into those communities in trying to, in a cultural, culturally responsive way of letting them know that there are rights that exist and that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'are here for them. And, you know, this is a constant struggle we do in every community that we work with a finding where the most marginalized and vulnerable communities and how can we make inroads into reaching them. So, you know, we can provide you the information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my concern is that people that haven't come to us. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Still, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You want me to speak to the. Oh, yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some of the things that the may or may have. And I didn't hear you address that. Some of those could be resolved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, absolutely. So the decrease in deliverables, I will say when we designed this, our initial proposal to the city for this contract, we looked at it and we said, okay, one attorney, you know, some portion of a paralegal, what is the maximum caseload that one attorney can carry in terms of eviction, defense?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe we proposed 40 reps because that's kind of the responsible caseload for an eviction defense attorney. In piloting the project, we've learned that that's not the primary need in Alameda, that the primary need that we've been seen is consultation services, no people wanting clarifications about the law, people not knowing what their rights are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we've proposed to modify, to increase our efforts there to, you know, focus more on outreach, on the tenant education, on the consultation services, trying to make inroads within the community as opposed to having kind of an arbitrary number of eviction defense cases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We want to prevent evictions. We want to provide the whole spectrum of services, not just eviction, defense, when a case has gotten to the point where there is no amicable resolution without, you know, a judge intervening, which goes along with the EFA services as well, that, you know, helps prevent evictions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like, no, I was just going to say, because you translate the acronym for people who don't know what that is, the EFA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, emergency financial assistance. So so we're not really viewing this as offering fewer services. We're viewing this as modifying existing services to meet the needs that we are finding that the community is presenting, that showing us that they need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, if you want us to focus only on eviction defense, you know, we could potentially do that. But we're finding in all of all of the jurisdictions we're working in, that having the broader range of services is the best way to combat displacement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the to correct me if I'm wrong, Mayor, but I think the two items that the mayor raised were, you know, the language availability and having to pay for that. And then, you know, the hours that being not convenient for people who live here and may also add on on language.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know we have a lot of folks that, you know, from East Africa or that speak Arabic languages and that's that's a growing population. Yes. In our city. So we need to be cognizant of that, those languages as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. And, you know, again, we use our language line. It's not a perfect solution, but we do serve clients from all in. I think right now I just saw our most recent bill for our language line translation. I think we had maybe 15 different languages that we are actively providing services to clients not just in the city'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of Alameda but throughout central legal and it is effective in court. You know, there's been recent case law where the court must provide an interpreter in court proceedings. But interpretation is expensive, you know, to have in-person interpretation. But it is it is important.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, again, we do have partnerships with other organizations where if if the need was presented, if we want to do a know your rights presentation and other language, we do have some partners we can draw upon to assist us with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, any any partners you can connect us with. Do you appreciated in terms of. Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And her answer. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we, we've, we've looked at the numbers for languages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So I just wanted to share that of the people we've served.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One person told us that they speak Chinese, Cantonese. Specifically, one person said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That they speak to speak Tagalog specifically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the rest were English, French and Spanish with a few people who did not report the language.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's for two. Maybe we shouldn't be built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It seems if it's only two. Maybe we shouldn't be billed extra.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're not. We're not. We're not building extra that we do. We? That was just part of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we haven't even agreed on what we're going to approve as far as funding for next year. So I you know what? I have got to wrap up really quickly. So you're going to say that the vice mayor would like to make his comments?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm just going to say, in terms of clinics and ours, you know, again, that that's a constant and we're open to suggestions or ideas. I think an appointment based system would be really great where we can do an initial intake by phone and set up an appointment based on the attendance hours, what works for them in the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city of Alameda, which we we do. We are doing that right now. That wasn't highlighted in the report, but that is something we are actively doing. And we have evening clinics as well, which I have noticed that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that in the report?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where was that? Yeah, that's just something we do. We work actually with the law school. So we have UC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Berkeley and you have evening clinics in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we do. And I'll tell you what, alameda tenants have been coming to this alameda me the hours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know alameda tenants have been coming but you can't count the ones who didn't come. And Councilmember Odie referenced people from Middle Eastern Arabic speaking countries. Some of those women who are veiled will not get on a bus and go over to Oakland by themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's part of being culturally sensitive. Let's hear from the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry. Thank you. So I actually before you before you leave, I just what I want to just clarify my my understanding when I look at your budget. So so you you had a you had a goal of a 125 connections last year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And now this year, we're we're going to we're going to drop that to 75. But ultimately, in the end, if I if I'm reading the report, right. You actually spoke to 62 people. Is that is that correct? So, so and the exact numbers aren't that important, but I just want to make sure that's that general understanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the general budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so this revised budget, really what you're proposing here is that you're going to do more outreach and for less money going to legal representation, you're going to you're still going to you're assuming you're still going to provide services to a greater number of people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. There will be more touches. We think the impact will actually be greater as we're out there giving presentations, providing that knowledge into the community, empowering the community to provide that knowledge to their, you know, friends, neighbors, family.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we do think that this will be actually a much greater impact by reallocate reallocating families.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes that went into this. So when I've been in your shoes talking to boards of diocese and these are never phone conversations, so thank you for your for your willingness to engage. My question is because I because I do agree that I mean, you know, when you live in a town where'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the ethnic makeup is 30% Chinese-American and somebody who and we've all knocked on doors as we're going around, knows that there are a lot of households out there that that there is knowing it's not even just, you know, low, low English proficiency, but but zero.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do think that that's a that's an issue that I would want to make sure is clarified if and as we move forward, how that is going to be handled both from the is, you know, I guess my question is this is this enough money for outreach, quite honestly, because it feels like printing some fliers and then'",
        "'speaker_7': 'dropping them off in some places and hoping people hoping people find them. So I might actually be interested in seeing if there's a slightly larger outreach in education budget that could could be used to reach some of the communities that were not current that that you've highlighted, that you're concerned you're not reaching into.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, I don't know what that right number is or in this may be it, I'm open to that. But I would also like to better understand how, to my colleagues point that if and when we move forward with with the contract, how we can utilize city resources and whatever else to have onsite in city meetings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I mean one of the good things about living next door to a really large city is that you have access to lots of resources that you might not if everybody was just the size of Alameda. On the other hand, sometimes there's this expectation that everybody leave the island in order to get services.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I am sensitive to especially the populations for. I can do here may not be the populations that have the flexibility, the time and whatnot to necessarily get in a car, drive and jump on a bus and spend 30 or 40 minutes traveling to a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'd like to kind of see that addressed as we're moving forward in this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I think there are, uh, you know, if there's a way to partner with some of these surrounding organizations, there are some that are actually active. They're based in Oakland as well, but active here in Alameda. Filipino Advocates for justice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, Asian Health Services. And some of those groups where, where perhaps it's not doing the drop in hours or something like that but actually doing a know your rights event co-sponsored with those groups where you could have breakouts in various languages and doing something like that where you're pooling resources to make it more effective and doing it'",
        "'speaker_9': 'maybe once or twice a year just to give the updates if there have been any updates to let people know what your work is. I'd love to see something like that. Co-sponsored with Alameda Renters and these other groups that are operating here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think as much as we can pool resources among the different nonprofits that are doing the work, as well as our legal nonprofits and our our activists to help get the word out. Then you have multiple people in multiple platforms helping with the publicity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not then an added budget expense and we can really coalesce and um, rather than duplicate. So I think that, you know, if we could see that and have some plan for that, whether from a staff perspective, I know that that's something that you and Debbie mentioned in your kind of report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There was an email that you sent clearing up some information. And I know we've talked about, uh, these sort of possibilities.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the perfect example of a know your rights that you co-sponsor is that I have referred when the Chans office wants to do a know your rights event in April, and I have referred them to Centro Legal to combine their forces and do something collaboratively.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're not having multiple events so we can get more bang. And the housing authority is working with central legal for a know your rights forum. So I think that that is exactly the kind of thing that's being looked at as part of the outreach and the enhanced outreach budget.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, finish your sentence and then I want to, I want to suggest a modification.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then I was, I was going to, if I, if it's helpful, I was just going to summarize a few of the key points that I heard this evening, which was on the interpret the interpreters. So, um, Centro uses the language, Centro uses a language line which we don't pay extra for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean that's part of the services and the language line. They, they do meet with a person in the room and then the translators on the phone so that they're with the client in person. And what I've heard is that the council might like to see a model where there is an initial contact and then a one'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on one appointment is scheduled with a time, and then arrangements can be made for an interpreter to be physically present. If, um, if that's what's warranted as a next step. I mean, it sounded like that there's either the language line or to try to identify somebody who could do interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, so I'll answer that. Although Council, I'm going to need your indulgence for about two more minutes when my time runs out. But, um, I, I have maybe softened on an interpreter, but if the, uh, the tenant says no, I would really like someone in person translating, I think that that person could be found.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I can't agree to is adding to this budget to provide more services, more outreach. Translation I think this budget has all that is needed. I know I read that whether you could do more outreach, but it would take more funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have stated that they're doing less legal representation, more tenant education. So that's non attorney time. So I would I, I think this this contract is plenty rich in terms of compensation, especially for touching fewer clients.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Asking for any additional compensation that the recommendation is a revised work scope with the existing the existing budget. So there's no request for additional funding from the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Notwithstanding what was said in the in the annual report.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, the point that was being made in the annual report was less about the translation and more about the cultural competency. And if the central legal were to do a deeper. I've around cultural competency that that was an exercise that would require additional funding.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And what they said was, however, and we're not asking for that additional funding, they were just pointing out that cultural competency is a different than just translation services. But what they're proposing is, as they do their their more robust outreach, they will be able to do some of what was being suggested tonight, such as reaching out to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Alice Liberty or the and other folks who may have connections in the community that can help with that, but not for any additional funding for that exercise. That's not what's being requested. There is no additional funding being requested this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Could I have a motion to give me maximum three more minutes on this item?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um. Yeah, I'll move that second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All in favor. I. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, um, I. So I take a few steps back, and again, I am stunned that an organization as well-regarded, incompetent as Central ago did not know that working in Alameda would involve working with Asian speaking, non-English speaking Asian clients.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so now they're having to do, you know, go back and make up for lost time. I'm saying that should have been part of the first phase in year one. So whatever they need to do to increase that cultural competency and there have been great suggestions from my colleagues about you don't have to reinvent the wheel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Asian health services, other you know organizations partner with other groups. But I, I feel strongly about they should do more to to do more robust outreach. But again, within that same funding envelope. And I if I'm going to vote for this proposal, I do need to see more time spent in Alameda for all the reasons that have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'been articulated and the um, because again, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is keep people from being displaced. And we're hearing from our tenants that now that tenants have a little more confidence or less fear to come forward and complain about habitability requirements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's already a struggle. People are working two and three jobs just to pay the rent. Let's not make them take time out of their busy days to go to Oakland. I think you know, you're serving Alameda. I think you should spend as much time here as you're spending in Oakland at clinics.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My thoughts? Okay. Who's next? Councilmember. Councilmember Diaz.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, thank you. I just want to make two points. First is, from a practical standpoint, the reason why we want to have more services provided in the city of Alameda is because from a practical perspective, we don't know if our if our funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are paying for clients from San Leandro or Oakland when they go to your Oakland office. So at least if we're in Alameda, we know that they're Alameda. So we know something about the way in which our funds are being expended.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Perhaps there's an answer to that that you have. But but that's that's one of the practical reasons why if we're going to fund services, that the services ought to be in the city in which, you know, the funds are coming from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, the second point is, um, I certainly, uh, I want to hear more and maybe it's not for tonight, but I just want to hear more about how your organization can guard against situations, um, where you're not getting the full picture.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, and. I certainly heard the. Part that you said that there's a clear distinction between legal representation, in which case you have to, as Councilmember Brody says, defend your client to the fullest. But I think I also heard that before you get to this phase of legal representation, there's also some information gathering that that that you do'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with the tenants. I think it's at that point where I would want somehow that that, you know, you also are gathering information from the small, small mom and pop landlords. That's that's who I represent. And, you know, those are the perspectives that I hear and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you know, maybe in this day and age, you know, it's not a politically correct thing to say, but it is what it is. And so that's that's what I want to hear, is that that there is a process by which, you know, you have internal procedures in place that that ensure that that you're doing all that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'you can in following your procedures to get the full picture of a certain situation before you take it to the next stage of of it being some kind of legal issue, at which point in time, yes. Council Member Ody is correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have to represent, you know, your client as best as possible. Not all landlords are right. Not all renters are right. You know, there's a gray area somewhere in there. And as professionals, you know, we have to figure that out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those are the two points that I want to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess my question was to our councilman. What, if anything, can we modify in this agreement here? Like could we require a check in in 90 days to, you know, implement some of the things that we've we've asked about?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could we require, you know, 5050 splitting of the of the meetings or, you know, as the mayor or flip it, like the mayor suggested? I mean, what type of things can we modify?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are all things you can modify, though the other side might have a saying yes or no as to whether or not they'll sign the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I'm not comfortable waiting a year. Yeah, but maybe there's some middle ground. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, the item is before you tonight, and you can amend the work scope and just just I just want to address Councilmember De Sykes at one point. We absolutely know that we are serving and paying for services delivered to Alameda residents.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is an intake form that is done and the central league, our work, our contract requires reporting. So we absolutely know that we are serving Alameda residents with the city's money. So I just want to make that clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Appreciate it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I was. I was. It sounds like the council might be interested in having the work scope further amended, which if we get directions, staff can do that so that we pursue the one on one appointments. And that I think what we heard from Central Legal this evening is that the the the drop in clinics more than monthly'",
        "'speaker_10': 'at mastic the know your rights events which are already contemplated are effective but that the one on one appointments may be the most effective way to to work with Alameda residents so that when they can be scheduled and they can have a block of time and they can schedule one on one appointments, we can absolutely provide space'",
        "'speaker_10': 'for them to conduct these meetings. We I think we should be able to do that. And then I think we can modify the work scope to include that. And then I would you had suggested 90 days. I was thinking about a six month check in back to the council where we could communicate, you know, a six month'",
        "'speaker_10': 'report check in. We can either do it as an off agenda or if the council wanted a presentation from from central legal staff, we could do that. And that might be a way to track how things are going and that they would be doing more outreach and work with translating materials.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those kinds of things are already contemplated in the work scope. And so it sounded like one of the bigger changes was the one on one appointments here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would add to that, I think I've said it a couple of times. I want to see more robust outreach to non-English speaking communities and then, uh, let's see, did someone else want to chime in? I just lost my train of thought to try and get it back at Councilmember Avila.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think one other thing is with or we're doing a rent registry right now, so we're going to have addresses and more information, correct. I think somehow utilizing that information or in anything that goes out from the city, including Centro's information on it, that has to happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I know there was a delay in having that happen before, and that was on our end. And I would like to make sure that that that that is part and parcel of it, that we are also doing our our job and getting the word out about these services being available.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that not only do we note that that Centro is a resource for for tenants to call, but also that that perhaps we do that in a couple of different languages so that are our tenants who speak different languages and especially languages that we know are prevalent, that they can call Centro and that language services are available'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to them. So they will get they will get legal services that this is not only for English speakers. So I think that that's something that we can do on our end. And certainly we need to make sure that we're doing that because that's part of the outreach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll just say there's already a line item in in their annual report for outreach and marketing. So this should be well within the scope. And what I was also going to add is this emergency financial assistance recommending $25,000 allocation the year in year to 30,000 in year three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But yet in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants received $47,462 in CFA grants. So why would we then reduce that amount? This is where I would feel more comfortable just holding back some of the $166,666 for the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to say, okay, you do the you find out who needs this assistance, let us know what you'd have to do anyway, because we have to have ultimate approval authority. And I mean, why would we only authorize 25,000 in emergency assistance this year when last year they allocated 47,000, I would say is the need getting smaller?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, last year out of this budget there was no right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understand. Understood, Ms.. Potter. But again, it's the same money we're talking the same funds that we're talking about. Emergency financial assistance to keep people from slipping through the cracks. So it's looking like the city will take that over now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm just saying, why allocate less for this next year than was spent last year?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, because they've been because tenants have been able to access the county money from last November through May. The county contracts still in place. It's an augmentation now. And then if the county contract is not renewed come May, then there's the 30,000 for the following year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it may be that one of the report backs to council can be what the county did with the contract in May to understand whether or not it's going to be a reduction or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm just reading from the annual report that says in the first year of the grant city of Alameda, tenants have received 47,000, etc..'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's correct. That's correct. From the County Funds Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me try something. So I'd like to move approval of the item with the understanding that staff comes back in four months because six months is on break. And then so that really that means seven. So I don't think that's feasible with hearing all of the concerns that were raised today and then seeing if you could come'",
        "'speaker_4': 'up with some agreement or modifications we could consider at that point to amend the agreement based on, you know, further research and negotiation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If needed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If needed. I don't know. We'll see if that fly. You can always.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Extend that again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, rather than change anything today, just come back in four months, because I'm sure everyone has heard everything that we've we've talked about. And then see if you can come up with different ways to amend the agreement in four months time that could help alleviate all these concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At no additional cost.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So based on council comments. Right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. Yeah. I mean, that way we keep moving forward and we don't let it lapse or anything, but we get a sooner reaction to some of these these things because I don't like the idea of amending from the dais, but, you know, I'm open to it if my colleagues have something firm that they they think the legal'",
        "'speaker_4': 'services group can agree to, but just it's emotion. We'll see what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Happens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second discussion. Vice Mayor That's right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So my biggest concern is four months isn't very much in time to get something here. We're going to have two months of data. I don't I don't I much as I don't want to wait until September, I really think that we should give them till September so that we can actually get some time, some time for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'them to to do something that they're going to be turning around. A report starting in about a month without time to have actually done anything that we're that we're looking to address. I'm fully supportive with the general motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would also just want to give a little bit, make sure that there's clarity on what things we're reporting back on, which in terms of in my mind is the in language, the how meetings are going and how outreach is happening and how successful that outreach has been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you making a substitute motion?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess I'm asking Councilmember Ody if he would be willing to accept that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, maybe if we can get it before the end of July. But, you know, it shouldn't take that much time to report out on the outreach efforts that are being done. It shouldn't take that much time to figure out which languages they need, you know, supported.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I mean, I don't know. I guess that's a question. So whether, you know, we give away X hundred dollars for assistance or we have, you know, 30 cases versus 60, I agree that we're not going to have that data, but I think there were some specific points that were raised specifically around meeting in Alameda and interpreting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'services that I don't know if you need data on. But, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Bell is going to clear this all that person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No pressure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No pressure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm wondering if we can get an off if if we can get an off agenda report back before before in four months and then have an A have this come back on agenda after the break in September. And I think that that that will keep us on track to have that report in time for September.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if there's if there's updates or information that comes in, it'll be it'll come in in time. For a report from staff to be developed, and it will give us an opportunity to weigh in. And if there's more information that we're seeking or more details.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So perhaps it's we can amend the motion to have an off off off agenda report back and in four months and then have this agenda is to come back to us in September.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does that sound to you? Councilor Roby Okay, so we have a modified motion that's been seconded.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yes. Sunbae, can somebody say goodbye? Councilmember Vel, any further discussion? All in favor. I oppose. Abstain, said the motion passes four in favor and one abstention.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you, everyone, for all the information you provided. At this time, we're going to take about a ten minute break. We will resume at 830. Thank you. 30. Okay. The council meeting is resuming. I get that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. I'll take that. Okay, so we are resuming, but we're going to do a little bit of. How could I ask everyone? Everyone. There would be everyone to please. If you wanted to have a conversation, do it in the hall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This council meeting is in session. Hello, everyone. Okay, so I've had a few requests about looking at the agenda. Order. Um, Madam Clerk, can you tell us you have the speaker's lists for all the different items that are still to be heard, which is to say the entire regular agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's 830. Which of them has the most speakers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Six, eight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Six, eight has five. Okay, well, why don't we start at the top of the alphabet with six? And then, um. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then six P has one and six F has two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's pretty similar. So. Okay. We are starting with 6a6am and three. Oh, you know what? I want to I want to just announcement or just keep coming up, ladies. Um, I did have a request from staff that not all staff were agreeable to merging items six B and 60.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we are. And merging them and they going to be heard separately. See, that was easy. Okay. Six. Wow. Is this right? What? You guys are doing that to me again?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, it's it's normal place. And usually it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It may just be a brighter group, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Yeah. Okay. To. Okay. Okay. So could I have a motion, please, to separate items B and C, back to being individual items. So move second a second by a council member. Decide all in favor I any oppose.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm Debbie Potter, the development director. And I am delighted to be here tonight to talk about the MRU with the East Bay Regional Park District for the Northwest Territory Regional Shoreline. And I'm even more delighted to have my coconspirator here, Amy Wooldridge, the Rec and Park Director.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I'm going to start and then I'm going to hand it off to her so that we're going to we're going to have to team you or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So open space and parks have been a really important part of the redevelopment of Alameda Point going all the way back to the Community Reuse Plan, which was adopted back in 1996. We have always had a big emphasis on open space, access to the water, more park amenities for the community.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the Northwest Territory has been one of the most important open space features that has been in the mix since the beginning and pretty much since the outset. We have been working with the East Bay Regional Park District to construct and maintain the Northwest Territory.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The city has a long standing relationship with the Park District, Crab Cove, Crown Beach and East Bay Regional Park District has also a long standing relationship with the VA, its immediate neighbor. So they make an excellent partner with the city on the development of the regional shoreline.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we are thrilled to say that after a long time of negotiating with the Park District, we have come up with an emoji that talks about what the components of the park are going to be, the shoreline and what are the main essentially the deal terms in the lease that will be negotiated over the next up to'",
        "'speaker_10': '12 months. We hope it won't take quite that long. And the Northwest Territory the the shoreline just high level. It is intended to be a passive park. It's 158 acres. It really emphasizes bicycle and pedestrian trails, viewing and seating.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Habitat restoration is an important feature of the regional shoreline. The amenities are pretty basic, kind of reinforcing the idea that it is a passive park and then the VA. Just one of the things to add and acknowledges that the VA is planning on doing a visitor center on its property that is intended to serve both the regional'",
        "'speaker_10': 'shoreline and the wildlife reserve. So they've offered up that space and they've incorporated that in their plan, which will be a nice amenity and feature. So high level, that's what we're doing. And then I'm going to turn it over to Amy, who is going to talk more specifically about the components of the menu, and then we're happy'",
        "'speaker_10': 'to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor and Council. So what you have before you is the exhibit A from the memorandum of understanding that my view and highlighted is on the northwest corner of the Northwest Territories regional shoreline. Some of the main points of the memo you that you have before you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a no cost 66 year lease. This is a long term lease agreement because this is state tidelands. And so we can't actually convey the land to any organization. So that's why it's a long term lease. The intention is for this MRU to be a high level, high concept document so that we will use this as the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'guiding principle to then over, as Ms. Potter said, over the next 12 months, hopefully less negotiate the actual lease agreement that would then come back before you and the Park District's Board of Directors. This is for the Park District to design, construct and then operate and maintain the Northwest Territories regional shoreline within two years of execution of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the lease. So potentially up to three years from now. The Park District would be required to develop a concept plan. That concept plan. It requires that there's is input from the Alameda community. We've I've already talked to them saying I can help them with organizing the Alameda community to provide their their input.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then also it would come to the Recreation and Parks Commission and ultimately to you as City Council for your input on that concept plan. Back in 2008, the voters approved measure WW the park district's bond to build and improve more parkland.'",
        "'speaker_5': '6.4 million of that at that time was allocated toward this project. So it really has been in the thoughts and in the works for quite a while, and that money in this milieu is clearly identified as is being put toward park development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also in the most recent, recent in past years, Measure C and more recently Measure F, this park is also identified for the Park District to be putting dollars from those measures into maintenance for this park. However, this park will cost significantly more than 6.4 million to design and build and construct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the menu also speaks to the city and the Parks District, working cooperatively to identify through grants and any other mechanisms to both constructive but also for maintenance dollars in terms of what the area is. It is 100 and x 158 acres of the Northwest Territories.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In addition, there's a section of the San Francisco Bay Trail that goes along the regional sports complex that the city is required to build. But once constructed, then it will be as part of this lease will be turned over to the Park District to maintain it as they maintain other areas of betrayal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the island also has the option term to construct and maintain the seasonal bay trail that goes from Northwest Territories around the southwest corner of Alameda Point and to Pave Park in this M.O., it details that the Parks District Park District is responsible for design and construction plans as well as for permits and to do the construction'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And it's important to us that the community residents have an opportunity to see this what's out there sooner than than when it actually opens to the public as a full park. So there is interim access. The Park District most likely will be doing guided walks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So however often once or twice a month, they'll do guided walks out to Northwest Territories, to the community, can see it and experience it because it really is quite amazing out there in terms of shoreline stabilization with climate change and rising sea levels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is was an important discussion point. The city is responsible for for the shoreline stabilization along the sports complex in that section of the Bay Trail, because that is part of it as identified in the master infrastructure plan for Alameda point will be a levy because it needs to protect that significant infrastructure of the sports complex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, the Northwest Territories itself will be what's called resilient design, managed retreat. There's different names for it, but as sea level, it will be designed up front to acknowledge that as sea level rise and as the sea rises, that that that the Bay Trail and other aspects may be moved inward as the level rises.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It will not have a formal levy around this shoreline park in terms of naming the park district retains that responsibility to name. However, they will be taking city feedback. They will also be considering names that that have a connection to Alameda and specific.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The National Naval Air Station history. And in regards to lease revenues, that's something that's important to us. We have a number of of leases, leases out there and both short and long term uses. And so the city will be retaining that lease revenue until they actually are breaking ground for construction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that, the next steps are for this body to consider this this MRU. And then if approved, it was already approved by the the Park District Board of Directors on February 4th. So yours would be the final vote on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we staff would be working on the negotiating the detailed lease agreement and bringing that to you within the next year. So with that, my partner and I are both available to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel like I'm under interrogation with that light shining in my eyes. I'll tell you anything. Okay. Thank you. Great presentation. Exciting project counsel. Do we have any clarifying questions from four staff on this report before we hear from the public speakers?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to hold mine till later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So let's hear from. And how many public speakers did you say we had last year?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Five. Five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So everyone gets up to 3 minutes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have Richard Bangert, Mary Spicer and Amy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Burns are the first three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor, and staff members of the council. Thank you for moving this forward and please continue to do so. It's been a long time coming. I just have a couple of comments. I would hope that before we get to a year from now, before a year passes, that there is some sort of workshop check in on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this IMO you process, let's say in the fall just so the public is apprized that we're not suddenly reaching an impasse because this is what happened with the wildlife refuge. There was there was essentially an understanding between the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Navy to have a national wildlife refuge until there wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it was really because of a few people that couldn't come to an agreement. And the public had no input on that. The city had no input on that. It was just we woke up one day and found out that it was going to be given to the VA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I have no problem with the veterans facilities being there. It is what it is. But I if this deal is not going to be consummated a year from now, I think the public has a right to weigh in because it's not like one of one of the parties is a private developer with proprietary financing information that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they don't want to divulge. It's to public agencies that we both pay taxes to. So I hope that we could have a check in if maybe in the fall some workshop or an agenda item where we can weigh in and find out if things are going smoothly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One other thing I'd like to comment on is in the staff report, it said something about the public being able to go out during construction. I'd just like to acknowledge what the Navy has been doing for the past five years or so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in effect, construction has been going on for about five years. And and it will continue this this year and perhaps a little into next year. And that involves about two thirds of this regional park area. And so some tens of millions of dollars have been or will be by the time they're done, put into re landscaping'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and re-engineering two thirds of this area, including a shoreline stabilization plan for everything essentially from about where the sports complex ends out around the tip. So that's also going to happen probably a year from now. So I think during the course of this, we should acknowledge what the Navy has done to bring it to where it is'",
        "'speaker_3': ', because they could have done much less and still pass muster for safety, but they went beyond what they needed to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Boehner. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mary Spicer, then Amy Barnes, then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pat Lamborn. Hi, Mary and hello City Council. I just want to say, last time I spoke, you unanimously voted against the server farmer out there on insulin. And I wanted to say thank you so much for that. I spend a lot of time on the water out in the estuary and insulin on Killarney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These the paddle the outrigger team out there. And I also stand up paddle and I'm very familiar with the land and of the Northwest Territory from the water. And I'm really coming here to to just give a little bit of future input on potential potential things that I think might be important.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some of the teams are some of the teams out there are very excited and wanting to get into wanting to get involved in some of the park development ideas out there. One thing that we're really interested in is potentially having a landing spot on the Northwest Territories, not something where boats can park, but places where sups stand'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up paddlers and kayakers and people that go around the island all the time, a place that we could land there and really enjoy the nature out there. And I also organized large garbage cleanups at Jack London Aquatic Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I call it I Heart Alameda Oakland Estuary and we pull out 2,000 of garbage every six months out of the shores of the estuary. And I really would love for the support to start to think of the garbage out there along the shoreline.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's so much garbage and also the garbage from the ferry parking lot that blows into the ocean, into the estuary that we end up cleaning up. I really would love for that to start to be if it could somehow be involved or some future thought on how we could start to clean up that garbage out there.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'My friend saw a big turtle out there once. We don't know how it got there, but I really think it's important that we make space for nature. With all the park development and all the development that's going in at the base, that we really start to think about how many boats we're going to put out there, how'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. Good evening. Mr. Ashcroft. Vice Mayor. Vice Mayor. John Knox. White Oak. Changing cast of characters, council members. It's late. I'm here. Well, let's see. Who am I? I'm a resident of Alameda. Long term, I am, as you well know, a proponent of parks on our bay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was recently elected to the. This is going to be a longer, long thing. Northern Alameda County Executive Committee of the Sierra Club. Right. Doesn't make an acronym. That's OC Sierra Club. Sierra Club endorses this. I think if there's anything that Aimee gets up and says, let's sign this memo, you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would just say just. I agree with Amy. I can't tell you how excited I am to see that Amy has put forward to move forward on this East Bay Regional Park District wants to move forward on this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Please agree and I enthusiastically ask you to sign this memo. You. It says a year we can achieve everything the previous speaker just said, but it will be a step towards that. We can spend $6.4 million, but if we don't sign the memo, you we can't even consider how to spend it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And so I just think it's it's it would be so inspiring to the people of Alameda if you went forward with this. I've seen in the Sierra Club, every city's passed a climate, you know, a climate emergency resolution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, what have we done about it? We're starting to do some things, but that's about the future. But what have we done about the kind of inundation, sea level rise, etc.? This is positive. This would be a shoreline resilience approach.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can look at the kinds of things the previous speaker talked about. We can do other things. We'll do this in cooperation with the East Bay Regional Park District. And as Richard said, and, you know, what an advocate has been will include the public will go out there, will have guided visits, you'll have a voice in that'",
        "'speaker_5': '. But we can't do it. If you don't sign the MOU, you please sign it. Say yes, sign it tonight. Um, and the last thing I'd say is there was this amazing article in the New York Times about and it compared us to Manila, you know, the whole San Francisco Bay in terms of sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was a phenomenal article. There was nothing in there as amazing as as these kinds of actions in our area. So let's be let's be the first city to do it. And let's be in The New York Times next year or the year thereafter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Irene Peter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. Council and mayor. I am Irene Dieter and I am a member of the East Bay Regional Park District's Advisory Committee. The Park Advisory Committee was appointed by Director Ellen Corbett, and I am here to wholeheartedly support you signing the menu tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This has been a long time coming. I have personally been lobbying each of you for this moment and lobbied your predecessors. So for the last decade we have been trying to get a park out on the Northwest Territories and it is becoming real and it is exciting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I encourage you to sign the menu this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. This beaver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Okay, counsel comments. So, to the left, Councilmember Violet. We'll move right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Along. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to keep this brief. I intend to support this tonight, and I think that this has been a long time coming. I know that this council, as well as previous councils, have spent a lot of time on this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to thank Amy for all of her work. I think a lot of times there's we all know how much work you do, Amy, but there's a lot of work that you don't get credit for that you spend a lot of time on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And navigating between two agencies takes a lot. And so thank you so much for for putting in the time and making sure that this is going to become a reality for Alameda. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor next week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Thank you. I'll be brief as well. It's been a long time going. One of the first projects I got involved with when I moved here in 2001 was fighting against the golf course in the convention center, at least ensuring that we had access, public access to the to the edge of this property, enough that my father'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in law still thinks I hate golf. So I will be enthusiastically supporting this as well as I just want to give a shout out to Miss Barnes and her proposal. Well, we won't be hearing that or talking about it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I really appreciated the thoughtfulness of it and it looks like a great plan. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, thank you. This is going to be absolutely beautiful project overall and I really look forward to the Bay Trail extending southward outside of the area that we're discussing tonight, the bay trail particularly extending in the part of alameda that is San Francisco County.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, that area is absolutely beautiful. I haven't been there since I think December 1996, but I remember when Captain Dodge was driving me around there, um, being able to see just the panoramic of the whole day with San Francisco in the distance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um. This is going to be a beautiful project. And I all of Alameda will be proud about this. I like the idea of that was mentioned of allowing. Paddleboards or stand up boards at park places. That's a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess I just want to end by saying when I look at the visual of the Northwest Territories, it really looks like a piece of the puzzle that is called Alameda Point. And more and more now, so much of those pieces of Alameda Point are falling into place and we're able to see it coming and achieving the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'vision that we had way back when. So thank you for the staff for bringing us here. And let's move forward with our M.O.. You with the East Bay Regional Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember Odie. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll. Before I do my comments, I will move approval of the item. Just so we get that table. I do want to thank Amy and our staff, and I think our city manager actually worked on this as well because we we've kind of had a logjam.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate everything that the community has done to push this forward. It's been ten years, right? I mean, I can't vote for this today without just giving a shout out to one of my former colleagues, Mr. Matt Arrestee, who, you know, when we were walking around town five years ago, he said that $6.4 million is not worth'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what it was when Measure WW passed. Well, here we are five years later and it's worth even less. So I'm glad we're finally getting this done. Just a few quick notes. I would like to, you know, make sure we have a check in if if we run into snags.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And these are two public agencies. So there's in my mind, no need to have, you know, discussions outside of public view because it's all taxpayer money. And I think I shared a concern with the city manager about the use of rodent sites.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So hopefully those things will be fleshed out in the you. But this is this is an amazing project. And to follow up on Mr. De Socks comment, I'm glad that we're now spending some time and some effort and input filling in the pieces because these pieces of the puzzle where we have parks, whether it's up in the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Northwest Territories or down in the deep park, are just as critical as, you know, site B, inside A and Main Street. So I do see actively and finally happy to say that we're getting this moving after ten years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, council members for your comments. I too am very enthusiastic about this project and Mr. Bangert, when he spoke, mentioned the Navy and the work they're doing. I thought you were maybe going to talk about the tours that they give, because once a year the Navy, along with the RB is Restoration Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The RAB does this amazing bus tour out all around to the areas that they've most recently cleaned up and the public can attend. It's anyone remember what tablet month is in July, so let's see if we can post that notice on the city's website closer in time to July, because I've gone for the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The views are amazing and it really gives you a sense, and especially we've gone from year to year just to see how much has been accomplished. I did want to clear up one thing, though, that there was a statement made that someone woke up one day and the land had been given to the VA, the Veterans Administration'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So just to keep things in perspective, we're a city, much as I would love to tell the federal government what to do. And I wouldn't I love to tell them a few things these days, but the pecking order just doesn't work that way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is federal property. Yeah. Some of it's been conveyed to the city, but first and foremost, the feds get to do Fed the Fed transfers, and that's how the VA got the area they have. But that said, we're a Navy town, a former Navy town.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a military presence here for many years. We're still a Coast Guard city. There will be an adjacent to the Northwest Territories, two very needed resources a vet, a VA clinic, and also a columbarium. And we are very excited that just a week or two ago in the president's budget, I know I didn't think I'd be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'excited about anything. But in the president's budget was a request for the majority of the funding that it will take to build the VA clinic where we have the funding in place for the Columbarium that I get asked all the time by veterans and their families, When are we going to see this VA clinic?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The last time I was in D.C., I met with the VA. Everybody was waiting for this budget, the current budget, and we were really hopeful. But lo and behold, the money was there. But I like to look at it is as we can all coexist.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think for veterans who are out there accessing the clinic, this is a very tranquil, peaceful. You just don't get more beautiful views than that. So there's there's room for all of us. And the only thing I don't think we're wanting to modify anything in this memo you but I think maybe in the least negotiation is when'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we want to make sure the road and rodenticide is like something that kills.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well yeah. The concern was that if you use that to kill the burrowing rodents, that then the wildlife would eat those and be poisoned. And we don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, so and again, because the the regional parks district has already signed the memo, you we don't want to been in the lease negotiation. It's just a lease term, not a lease to turn. Right. But anyway, the and then the one item that I want to include in the lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And yeah. We've got to vet. It was a joke, a little inside joke. Okay, my and my ask this is important to people opening restrooms. There is. Because I emailed with staff today and said, okay, I get we're going to have restrooms, but who's building them?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where does it say. Well, it could be the VA or it could be the East Bay Regional Park District. By the time the lease comes around, I want to have specifics, please, about who's building the restroom facilities. But otherwise, I think this is really exciting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bless you. And so we have before us a motion to authorize the city manager to execute an MRU with the East Bay Regional Parks District related to the Northwest Territories regional shoreline. It's been moved and seconded. So all in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any opposed? Any abstentions? Of course not. The motion passes unanimously. Good work, everybody. Thank you. You know, we're going to save time. We've it's almost it's after nine and we just finished our first item and we've now separated B and C.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that, thank you, everybody, for coming out and speaking. Could we have item six B, please.'"

    "Review and Direction on Planning and Building Code Enforcement Program.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to review the Planning and Building Code Enforcement Program in response to the City Council's November 19, 2019 referral and provide direction on potential future changes to the existing enforcement program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mr. Tom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Members of the Council, Andrew Thomas Planning Building and Transportation Director. As Laura said very quickly, this is a response to a November referral. The Council asked that we look at the city's code enforcement program. The referral included some suggestions and thoughts about how things might be changed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This has been a helpful process for us. We we took the last month or so to sort of do a sort of a self-evaluation. We hope that we did a good job describing the program for you in our staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we've sort of laid it out as in sort of three areas where this is where you might take the opportunity to make adjustments to this program. If you see fit the three basic areas that we sort of looked at that you might want to make adjustments is in the priority system, which was originally adopted by council'",
        "'speaker_3': '. This is how we prioritize these cases, how we in terms of addressing them. The second area is budget, budget for resources and staffing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Thomas, can you just tell us when were those priorities adopted?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were originally adopted in 1999. They have been back before. Later councils. Later councils haven't changed them. But look, every council is a little bit different. We are in very different times in 2020 than we were in 29, 1999.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's absolutely up for discussion and it's I think it's healthy that we are having this conversation about those priorities budget first in terms of just how many, how much resources you want to put into the program. And then a third area that we tried to think through and the referrals just sort of let us down this'",
        "'speaker_3': 'road is is there a way to sort of reorganize all of the city's code enforcement programs? So with that, what I'm going to do is turn it over to Greg McFadden, um, our long time building official and assistant planning building and transportation director.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He's been overseeing this program for many years and can really, I think, do the best job of taking you through the slides. And then we will be available to answer any questions or take your direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. McFadden.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Thomas Eliasberg Code Enforcement Department was established in 1997. Originally it was in the police department. In 1999 it was transferred under the building department and building official. Let's see. Currently, the code enforcement division is made up of four full time employees overseen by the building official.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a senior code enforcement officer to code enforcement officers and a code enforcement tech. We are comparable with other city surrounding cities with one officer for 26,000 residents. Code punishment stats the past six months. Which is the first time sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the first time in the last five years code enforcement has been fully staffed. We've reduced the outstanding code enforcement caseload from 1100 cases to just over 600 cases over the past five years. Our monthly average of cases has been 23.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Received two cases. Refer. This would be graffiti or something on the public right of way. We refer to a different department. Six cases determined to be invalid and 20 cases that are. We've gained compliance through permits or other methods, so the code enforcement priorities were established just over 20 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just before I became the building official here, the then City Council, including Councilmember de SOG, approved our code enforcement priority list. There are four categories high priority, which we follow up on within 48 hours. Medium priority, which we get to within five working days, low priority, 14 to 30 days and secondary priorities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We follow up as we can get to them. So briefly, the priority cases are high, priority are illegal units, housing code violations, illegal occupancy, and dangerous buildings. Medium cases. We have work without permits, abandoned vehicles on private property, vacant buildings and graffiti.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Low priority cases. We have garbage, illegal signs and litter. And then we get to the secondary categories which are noise use, permit violations, illegal parking on private property and fences. So code complaint processing. Code enforcement is a complaint based system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't go out looking for code violations. We take in the complaints. One of the premises we deal with when we're dealing with a code enforcement action is we need to determine everything we do. At some point, we have to defend in court or at a hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're there's a lot of process and detail that goes into it so that we can defend what we've done. Each case is entered into the permit tracking system, is prioritized for the council priorities. Initial assessment is done by the code enforcement staff through drive by inspections, photos taken permit history, and then they determine whether the complaint'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is valid or invalid prior to any scheduled inspection or notice of violation. Administrative Citation or Legal Action Staff does exhaustive research, sends letters, makes phone calls, has meetings at the counter attempting to gain compliance. All notices, violation citations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Legal notices are sent both regular mail and certified mail and are currently recorded with the county. So that's a little history. So potential changes we've looked at in doing this review. The first one would be review the priorities, possibly change them, leave them alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are no additional resources and that can be accomplished immediately. The second is provide more resources, more staff. Again, currently we have one officer per 2600 residents. The cost of adding additional staff one full time code enforcement officer is about $114,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One supervising code enforcement officers about $174,000. And then there's a one time 40,000, $50,000 for a vehicle and for reconfiguring office space to provide space for that personnel. How would that additional staff be paid for? Currently, all code enforcement funding is paid for completely out of planning building fees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fund 209. If we were to ask for additional resources, we could ask for money from the general fund, which again takes money from other city priorities. Increase planning and building permit fees, which would require a fee study. It increases the housing cost and correspondingly we would see reduced quality of materials to cover increased costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We discourage investment and as we see a lot, when we raise fees too much, we get the result increase in work without permit. There could be an increase in the rent control programs we have certainly seen since the Rent Stabilization Ordinance have been passed an increase in complaints to code enforcement from tenants and property owners regarding those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'issues. So that could require that would also require a fee study. It would be additional financial burden to landlords. Currently, the rent control fees are being studied to help fund the prosecution unit in the city attorney's office. If council if council wish to pursue this option, we would look at a third general fund, a third plan in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'building, and a third rent. And we would come back to the council at mid-cycle. So the last item is sort of where this referral had sort of originally pointed us to, which is a reorganization and consolidation of of all code enforcement activities within the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would be planning building public works, base reuse community development all into a single consolidated division reporting to the planning, building and transportation director. Funding for the new division would come from a combination of sources, including planning, building fees, public work fees, rent stabilization fees and general fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of the issues we have in implementing such a program is that current staff performing code enforcement duties outside of planning and building, that's just a small portion of their jobs. And so they're not. There would be an issue in how how would that work?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's also limited space in city hall to accommodate a consolidated division. Some of the pros of the reorganization. Consolidation had better coordination, increased efficiencies. Central point of contact for all code enforcement complaints. Some of the downsides are, again, limited space within City Hall to accommodate consolidated division staff outside of planning, building code enforcement or have other duties'",
        "'speaker_3': '. A small portion of their job is the conversion of duties or doing an increased costs. If council wishes to pursue this option. We would come back to council at midyear. So as part of this review, we are we took a pretty deep look at it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, we've been doing this for a long time. So it's always good to be reminded to go back and take a look to see how you're doing things. When things three things came out of this was her improvements we're implementing currently initiating a monthly coordination meeting between the five departments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're starting with the city attorney's office, starting and going to start to meet, ironed out how we want to do things, bring the other departments in so that we have a consolidated look whether whether we combine the departments are all having a consolidated look at how we're doing work, transparency, initiating a quarterly report on code enforcement activities'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for the city council in the public. And then I think this has to be the next item that we were joined in that enjoined is a streamlined administrative citation process. And then currently we are soliciting proposals for collection agencies to help collect unpaid citation fees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So inclusions code enforcement is not easy work, it is mundane, it is detail oriented. You go out to places where nobody wants you to be. Your code enforcement officer Linda Givens is in the room but can attest high places.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who are friendly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a lot of stuff out there. And again, nobody, nobody welcomes you with open arms when you come out for code complaint. If we do too much code enforcement, we get complaints. If we do too little code enforcement, we get complaints.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this referral is a good opportunity for us to take a look at staff. Again, there's always room for improvement. Any requested council changes to the priorities. Again, we could do that tomorrow. The other changes would either come back mid-cycle or mid year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for that presentation. City Manager Eric Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mayor and council members. I just want to add a little bit to it. First of all, I want to say that I want to congratulate Greg and the plane building and transportation director, because I think they've taken this and as he has mentioned, they've already started making changes even before you start to take action.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they're trying to at least start looking at it, start evaluating it. We see that there are priority changes at the council. We want more direction through this meeting, but I think they're trying to do that. Two big issues we're seeing probably the need to add one staff member, at least that's my view in talking with Andrew'",
        "'speaker_11': 'and probably sort of a working supervisor type position. But then the second issue is whether you want the more consolidated department that may take a phasing of first doing an addition in the department and then trying to figure out how you combine those resources if you want to have the larger consolidated division, because some of those functions'",
        "'speaker_11': 'are done by other departments, by staff that are doing other functions for those departments. So how do you take some taking them into this department would be problematic to those other departments. Not bringing the resources resources over could be a problematic thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's those are a couple issues we would need to discuss through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I know from reading the staff report that you do favor a consolidated approach, at least you were quoted as such in the step forward. So we'll come back to that. So thank you for your comments. Any other staff, Mr. Thomas, do you want to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So do any public speakers on this went to public speakers. Council Do we have any clarifying questions before we hear public speakers here? Vice Mayor Not quite sure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. Thank you for that report. Very helpful. Good to see you again. Also nice to see you, Mr. Evans. Appreciate how responsive both of you have been through the last year when I've had questions about about this issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. My first question is when you are doing the comparison staff per population, per residents, does that include if we add a new supervisor, is the supervisor included in that? So because it seems like right now we are currently staffed about similar to other cities, if we add another, what happens if we add add the supervisor'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that's been recommended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was we just first of all, let me preface this survey. I think one of the things we found out with surveys is every city does it. There's a lot of similarities, but it's a little tricky trying to figure out exactly how many officers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the what we did is we we did not count admin staff. So we have one person dedicated to admin and we didn't administrative services and we didn't try to compare that with the other cities, just officers, people just doing that work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if you added, I think what the city manager described at the end, there was what we call a working supervisor, not somebody who just sits at a desk, but somebody who's supervising and out in the field. So that would increase our ratio.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Relative to the other cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. For sure. And then my other question is, in a couple of places, you mentioned that throughout the city, not just in your department, the code enforcement officers are also doing other things. So in terms of the code enforcement officers, what proportion of their time in general understanding that's probably different in each division, are they actually doing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'code enforcement as opposed to these other duties?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I actually don't have that information. What we're talking about is primarily full time employees in public works who have do some of their job is enforcing city codes in the public right of way and other portions of their job might be maintaining streets and roads or things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's all we were. What we sort of struggled with with the consolidation was how do you bring primarily those people into a consolidated code enforcement division if in fact they have other jobs that they're doing and reporting to other managers for those jobs?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what we struggled with with the consolidated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Maybe don't go away. I think Councilmember Vella has a question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I have a few questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You stay longer. Oh, he's handed over to Grady.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, Andrew, I in the staff report, we compared ourselves with the comparables that we looked at were San Leandro Hayward. Do those cities have separate code enforcement, consolidated units?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Most of them had were organized very similar to what? How we were organized. So planning and building in forest planning and building codes, public works, public works codes or public right of way violations, I think. What? Was sort of struck me in on some of these when looking the other cities was some of them organize their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'selves around planning and building codes. Quality of life codes. You know, like we're going to dedicate a whole person to, you know, not, you know, life safety issues, but graffiti. Some of the things that are on your or your the council, the the existing priorities are very low things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're not life safety. They're the low priority ones. Um, I think I forget what city is, but they dedicated entire.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just to dealing with those codes and those types of. Mm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm on the lead abatement JPA and I do know that Berkeley has their own kind of way of doing things, but they have a code enforcement unit. They also have a health and safety and public public health department that works with that unit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, Emeryville is thinking about putting something on the ballot to create a new code enforcement officer. And the city of Oakland, which I saw we did a comparable with. They also are kind of amending how they're doing things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is there a trend to change things that you've noticed or is it just those cities that are that are looking at it?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think I did not see a real trend among the various cities. What I did notice was that, um, all the cities, including Alameda, I think, were struggling with, um, just the new kinds of issues that we have to deal with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um, you know, for all the right reasons, we're passing new kinds of laws that we just never did. I mean, I've been in this business for 30 years, like, you know, everything from, uh, you know, marijuana. We never dealt with that before.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We never, you know, rent control was pretty rare when I lived in Berkeley. We dealt with rent control, but no other Bay Area city that I ever worked in dealt with the rent control issue. So I think we're struggling a little bit and all the cities are trying to figure out like, how do we do we deal'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with some of these newer issues and what's the best way to organize ourselves? And I think each city's kind of going a different direction and independent direction.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And to that end, I mean, I think that there's I what what I've been struggling with is there's the building side of things and the building codes which are very detailed. And then there's the health and safety aspect of things that might be outside of that realm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you referenced some of them. So I was looking at our priority list. And the question I had is where does, you know, smoking violations fall within that priority list or mold or lead issues? Where do where do where do they fall in that list or the enforcement of the night sky ordinance that we have or ADA'",
        "'speaker_9': 'issues or Airbnb complaints or minimum wage violations or the straw ordinance that we have. I think there have been a lot of ordinances that this Council has, and the past council that I was on worked on, whether they were environmental concerns, health and safety concerns, accessibility concerns.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so where do they fall within that priority list? And do we need to give more direction about how those ordinances fit in with the overall goal of code enforcement or who who do those complaints go to?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'm going to give you the short sort of dumb answer, and then I'm going to like try to give you more specificity because he is the one who actually has to he and Orlando, like, figure out, like, all right, we just got this complaint where is a fit in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you're right, hold lots of new laws that weren't around in 1999 when this original list was put together. Um, but, and I think so for all the reasons you've mentioned, that's why we put the priorities first and foremost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like it does feel like that list is worth taking another look at and maybe updating, reorganizing, um, the, you know, the short answer on things, you know, once again we're split up so smoking on the public right of way police is primarily dealing with that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the things that we and um and one of the other things that we've been talking about internally and Greg mentioned this idea of like, we're just going to improve our coordination and we don't need your direction to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can start doing that already. But um, you know, the, we rely on the other departments, you know, like the nighttime inspections or nighttime complaints. We rely on the police department. Our department relies on them to help us go out and check that late night noise violation and those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Craig, do you want to say anything more about how we try to fit new ordinances? Into the old priority system. A lot of them that you mentioned, LED abatement is certainly a life safety issue. It's tied to the building code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we we address those and I think we've been pretty successful about with that. Orlando is, I believe, been given an award for lead abatement enforcement. So I'm very proud of them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there's all the trainings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If Mr. Givens would like to add anything to the conversation, please, please come up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are a couple of things that I would like to say specifically when it comes to lead and mold, we do consider those as very serious issues. Lead is an issue unto itself. Mold. On the other hand, we really treat a little bit differently because mold is more the symptom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The disease is water intrusion. So what we go after is from a code enforcement standpoint is we abate the water intrusion. Once you do that, then abating the mold is easy. If you simply attack the mold without addressing the water intrusion, the mold comes back every time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we you know, we're we're a seaside community. We see a lot of mold. This is a very frequent this is something my team deals with on a daily, if not at least weekly basis. So so what we've learned through through through more than a bit of experience is that if you attack the disease, then the system'",
        "'speaker_3': 'takes care of itself. I think from at least in regards to prioritizing the other issues that you mentioned, we are working on trying to figure out how to incorporate those things. But the life safety issues, we're addressing those immediately.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's very helpful. Thank you so much. Okay. Councilmember Vella, did you have your questions answered?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One other one more question is, I noticed that we included in the in the potential budget that there would maybe need to be a car. Are there other tools? I know that there's do we have like all of the you know, from the the Healthy Homes Department, they have different there's new new technology for inspecting, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', and finding mold, identifying it for and for finding moisture, I guess you could say, and identifying where the moisture is coming from. The led, you know, doing the on site led with the identification with the camera. Do we have those tools?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Have we been trained in that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have the tools where we are not trained on that little head stuff. We use the county to assist us with that. We work together with them. The 40 to $50000 that was in that line item was car office, computer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All the tools and code enforcement, surprisingly, doesn't need a lot of tools. Pen the red sticker that they put on people's houses and and just the research that they do. So there's not a lot other than the vehicle to get around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Other clarifying questions before we go to our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know if I have a question, but just a comment if that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. Well, yeah. We'll have a discussion after. Is it a quick comment? Go ahead. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It seems to me that what we as a municipality are good at when it comes to code enforcement has to do with the built environment. And when you look at, you know, the priorities that were established back in 1999, you know, I'm sure they spoke to the very same built environment issues for, you know, that preceded for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'decades, 1999 but continue to 2020 2019 I think were Councilmember Vela is getting at is that there are and as planning director Thomas says there are these new areas though that that there are in need of code enforcement they're just not built environment related but more and more are there there is going to be kind of an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'intersection of social code enforcement and built environment code enforcement. For example, when you look at the the buildings underneath the overpass at on Webster Street, that's a code enforcement issue. But also it's obviously a social and health related issue that suggests not just, you know, kind of the built environment framework, but also kind of this social, you'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know, working with health care outreach workers and all that. So I think down the road as as a city, as we're meeting, these new challenges were requiring the city manager to come up with different ways of of reframing what it means, what code enforcement means.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that's I think that's where. Councilmember Vela is coming from in, and I certainly agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I need to just comment quickly on the Constitution way over passing the encampment, if you will, that is going into there. There are tricky enforcement issues because that is actually Caltrans property. And so our police department, Alameda police department cannot go and enforce anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, we have to wait for the California Highway Patrol, which is the enforcement arm of Caltrans. So that isn't so much a code enforcement issue. I agree that it's health and safety. We are working across jurisdictions, getting more responsiveness from Caltrans, which is a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Still not as rapid as we would like. But I think as we speak in the last week, there was some enforcement action going on. And yes, it's but but that is not anything that the code enforcement folks would be dealing with just for the public listening to know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're on it. Okay. If that's all the council clarification, let's hear from our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Catherine, Pauline and Armando Grasso.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. I think this is really timely, as I mentioned earlier, now that renters are feeling a little bit more secure. They're bringing some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Habitability issues. I think there is a real need for education around this. Once you guys clarify it, I was very pleased that the city manager reached out and spoke with a number of tenants and myself about some of the issues that were coming up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I began to discover how many categories there are. And after all these years, I didn't even know that noise is actually under a nuisance under enforcement. So technically it is a police department matter. But one of the people with us had had many very serious noise complaints.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the problem was, is the police department doesn't have the decimals or I'm sorry, what is the first decibel, a decibel meter? I put them both together and this tenant discovered that there actually is an app for that, that you can download it on your phone and if you're going to track and if there's sleep deprivation is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it's a torture technique. I mean, you can't function if you're not sleeping. And there has to be a way to be able to track and to actually have what is the noise decibel? Is this truly a nuisance? Also, the issues around mold, the difficulty of that, certainly a health and safety issue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yet people who have called the planning department have been told that it basically is extremely low and these are both health and safety issues if they get to a certain level. So I'm very pleased that this is coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think for both property owners and for tenants, it's going to be extremely helpful that once this is defined that there is an education effort. And also, I believe tracking because I believe there were far more complaints that were not referred or followed up on to other departments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were far more than two that were referred to other departments. And so I'm a little bit concerned because tenants are being told we don't do that and it doesn't even seem like the information is being taken. So I think for their budget and especially if they want to hit the rent program for part of it, because'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we are getting a little more confident, we want buildings in Alameda to be maintained too. We want to be safe in our homes. So thank you for doing this work and we look forward to helping however we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Grassa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Amanda. Amanda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council member. And we need Center Central de la Raza. Your city residents need the program. I'm asking for every everybody's well-being in this time and age and the rental crisis. Seriously, we all can really benefit from their services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've helped many already mediate the rental situation, such as myself, and they offer valuable services. Please take in consideration what's best for our city's residents. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. With that, all of our public speakers. Okay. So with that, we will have concert council comments and deliberation. Let's start in the left, if I may, Councilor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So you're right. What are you asking us today? And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, for the audience.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are you asking? I'm happy to be on the left.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was. I was thinking that ideologically as I speak.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fine. What are you asking for? US?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, which is left and which is right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, this was. Oh, yes. You asked us for kind of an opportunity to make adjustments. Okay. Sort of our look at our program, I think, um, you know, the city manager's recommendation is that we should add another person to the department.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want to go that direction, we certainly can. We'll bring it back in the mid-year budget. Okay. That's sort of where it sort of sits as of now. But we we didn't want to just say, oh, yeah, hey, we need just more people solves the problems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we think it's this is really a multi there's many angles to this problem and priorities how we check in with you how we make sure that we're prioritizing things correctly given these new codes and new challenges, I think is very important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we'd love to hear from you about that. Um, how do you want us to think about the budget issues moving forward, you know, the consolidation of all the various departments? I think the what we were basically saying is there is definitely room for improvement and coordination that's can be done without any major decisions from you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've already started that process. Uh, the actual physical consolidation of all these different functions under one department is going to be a little just tricky, tricky and, you know, potentially expensive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I, I, I do agree that I think you do need an extra person, and I like the idea that you guys proposed to do a third, a third and a third. And I think technically half of that third gets passed on to the tenants, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I mean, it's not all quote unquote burden on the landlord. I do want to say I appreciate that you proactively looked at at the process and took this as an opportunity. I know this. I know there's very few staff left, but we do throw a lot of work at you and a lot of things above and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'beyond the normal, normal day to day work that you have to do in addition to everything that we want done. So I do appreciate that. And I actually had to get a permit a couple of weeks ago. And I will say it was a very smooth and efficient process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And everyone down in that office was was super helpful and super friendly. So whatever you're doing there, keep doing it. Yeah, I think that's basically it. I know. As we do. As tenants do, become more comfortable making complaints.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we have to understand that those those issues will be repaired. And that's why I'm glad that I think it's in April, an updated CIP capital improvement program is coming to the council so we can make sure that, you know, landlords have the ability to actually make those repairs because I mean, like Katherine said and many'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of the landlords that have spoke, you know, we all want to make sure our housing stock is safe and compliant. So I just, you know, thank you for everything you've done and I appreciate all your work. Andrew, and making sure your department operates efficiently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The heavy lifting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That you're talking about. You make your boss look good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember Desai on my right, my right, your left.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, thank you. You know, I think one of the things that is in the staff report is one of the things that's in the staff report is the point that that we don't as a city have a bulk of code enforcement issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, so if, if that as the backdrop, I'm concerned of having one additional code enforcement dealing with what are perceived to be problems on the part of landlords in the city of Alameda. I mean, one part of the community might say that's the case, but maybe that's not the case.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I, I, I, you know, it's hard for me to, I just don't want us to be going after landlords just because someone says so. You know, the data has to speak and stand for itself. And it's it's not there right now, at least.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Based upon my reading of the of the staff report. So I would be concerned about that. If there is there has to be a broader case to be made about the need for code enforcement, additional code enforcement. I'm willing to hear about it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if the case is narrow with a narrow one in which, you know, it's all about going after small mom and pop landlords, then then I have a problem with that. So I just want to point that out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Jason Weissman. That's why.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I think it's a little problematic to start choosing who we're going to and going not going to go after based on who they are. Personally, I, I represent everybody. I'm a small mom and pop landlord. I'm doing a bad job and I'm not up to code.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You should come in and find me. You know? So my biggest concern is I think there's been a good case here. This is the second meeting of the year in which, hey, let's hire a new person has been put before us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was the parade two weeks ago or four weeks ago. Now here we are, another one. And we're marching our way up to the mid-cycle. And I still feel like we have some issues, whether it's homelessness and transportation and whatnot, that that before I'm going to be comfortable making a long term commitment to to new staffing, I'",
        "'speaker_7': 'want to I want to have that conversation a little bit more holistically. That said, you know, I kind of understanding where this issue came from and whatever else, right? The way I look at it, we had a, you know, a building of people who were dealing with a a I, I, you know, it's hard to say who'",
        "'speaker_7': 'was responsible. They filed nine complaints and they finally had somebody come out and then the complaint stopped. But it took nine complaints. The planning board made a decision that didn't make them happy. And the response for me in the city was, don't worry, you call and we'll take care of the complaints, except for the fact that we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we don't we aren't responsive to noise complaints. Right. We we now have a I didn't know we had this list at the time. Noise complaints are the sometimes we drop by and check them out sort of thing. So, you know, to me, I think, you know, as we're having this conversation now, what I would say is I'm'",
        "'speaker_7': 'more than comfortable having a mid-cycle a conversation about this staffing position. Whether or not I'm going to support it or not is is completely up in the air for me. But I'm not saying I wouldn't support it, but I need to see it related to some of the other things we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would really like us to have a meeting. I don't know if tonight is the night at quarter to ten. With everything else, we have to start identifying the priorities. I'm a little nervous that it's way too specific.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think Councilmember Vella did a great job of rolling out all the different, you know, kind of, you know, smoking and noise. And, you know, some of these things aren't on here, but they are clearly the types of things that make a place you live inhospitable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. So and that should be a priority whether you are renting or whether you are owning your your your your your place. So I you know, I would ask maybe if if we can bring back the priorities, maybe maybe if you kind of thinking about that frame, I don't know if they if that's a frame bringing that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'back, you know, I'd like more data. I well, I found it nearly unreadable. It looks like an old access database that maybe I've created in college and would print out for people. And then they'd say, I can't read that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I did appreciate trying to, you know, trying to understand what's going on. Summary data would be really, really good, you know, so that we know what kinds of things, you know, again, I the things that came up great to know about the staffing congratulations on being at full staffing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My team at work was at full staffing for the first time ever in seven years on January 2nd and was no longer at on January 18th. So I know how that goes is my point. Right. And it probably will be another seven years before I have everybody back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But, you know, when we're looking at like March 21st. Yes. A couple of these things are when you read them like, holy cow, this is bad, and yet it's been open for nine months. It would be good to kind of get the, you know, what are we closing, what's opened, who's been fined?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. That's another thing we've heard is we're not writing a lot of citations, the lot of verbal and you know, maybe the first noise complaint is not a citation, but maybe the second or third one is. And so how can we tighten up those rules and start writing those citations?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have a prosecutor who, you know, who can start helping with that. We have a collections agency. We've had some bad experience with collections agencies in the past and a really bad one about ten years ago. So let's make sure that we're dealing with somebody who's not a shakedown artist.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But, you know, I thought that was a good one, but I think if we could maybe just get some between now in the mid-cycle, some monthly reports, what are the reports we're getting? What are the types of things what are happening to them while while we're talking about these priorities?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would that would be right where I would come in on this. But thank you. Good. Very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I could just clarify one thing. We had talked initially about the midyear, but we probably will be moving to mid-cycle because we're talking March. We're talking about March to May. Well, we admit a mid-year march to May, but that way you can see it within all the priorities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So soon. Yeah. Okay. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So this was my referral and I do know that there's a connection with kind of the mixed use complaints that happened, but this was also. The result of a number of complaints that I'd heard kind of across the board from constituents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to recognize that code enforcement is not easy work, and there's a lot of different elements to it. I think we've been very focused on the building code enforcement aspect of this, and I think that there have been a number of things that have evolved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have a lot more mixed use areas now, especially that are in development. And I think one thing that we may want to look at is are our processes in place in terms of our ordinances for those types of sites?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Have we thought about different types of notification processes or things to actually help facilitate to prevent some of the issues that came up? Maybe that's a recommendation that could come back to us from staff, you know, in a follow up, as is how to deal specifically with mixed use areas in terms of zoning, I think that something'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that that seems to me needs to be developed and I'm glad that the steps have been taken since the referral. Working more in coordination, I think that there's a lot of the right hand not talking to the left hand.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I do think that a consolidated unit can help us get get through that. And there is going to be a transition period, but it's something that we really need to look at doing. And that's because I think that this needs to evolve from just the building code enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are a lot of other regulations on the books, and we're doing things with our Climate Action Plan. We're doing things with with some of our other codes. And if we aren't going to be enforcing them, it's going to be problematic because it's just going to be an ordinance in the book.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And whether or not it's followed, I don't know. I think we need to. And what I would like to see is a process set in place. Who you know? Is there a single line that people can call for these code related issues?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What is the process for getting back to people? Greg, I thought you did a great job of saying these are our high priorities, these are medium, these are low. I do think we need to have a council conversation about the priorities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that that document's hard to follow. I think we need a matrix of like just generally speaking, general categories. And then this is the timeline who will be responding in how much time and then tracking it. We need to know if this person has had one code enforcement complaint on this issue or multiple ones.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And to the vice mayor's point, are we following up? Are we are we making sure and closing things out? There was there have been some big issues. And I know, Orlando, you you responded. There was a construction around a preschool where there was lead found and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, to me, if that person, you know, it took there was a whole process for that, that's great. But I think we also need to highlight when we do those big enforcement actions so that people know that this is not behavior that is tolerated here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We do not we are not okay with you spreading, you know, lead paint in an area near a preschool, things like that. I think now that we have the the prosecutor's office in house, I would like to know what our plan is for for potentially moving things over to that office or letting them know once something has'",
        "'speaker_9': 'risen to a level of, look, this person is just not complying. I don't necessarily see this as a tenant landlord issue. I see this across the board. I see this in connection with our climate action and resiliency plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I see this in connection with making sure we have dispensaries now in town, making sure there's a number of different issues that come up with that, making sure that we're our all of our buildings are ADA compliant, whether they're commercial or residential.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there are a lot of things that we've passed, and we're going to need a non-police code enforcement unit to really go out and and be accessible to people. I and I would like to see a proposal that has some sort of alternate workweek in it.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'to look at things differently than, say, police. And and I think that that aspect is going to be helpful in terms of actually facilitating conversation, communication and enforcement. And there's a lot of things that happen over the weekends and at nights.'",

So we're being asked to consider it suggested that we consider potential changes in the code enforcement program around three primary factors which are priorities, financial resources and or organization.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'were increasing fees for well, it could come from the general fund. We could increase planning and building permit fees. And it was noted in the the report that the problem with that is if you make permit fees too costly, it's a disincentive to people improving their properties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some people actually try to do work without a permit because it's so costly. So we have to be careful there that we don't defeat the very purpose we're trying to achieve and then increasing or providing rent control program fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're already there's a study fee study right now because we're looking at a portion of this fee to fund a previously approved prosecution unit within the city attorney's office. And again, if we impose ever steeper fees on our landlords, that's a disincentive for them to improve their properties.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we want good habitable rental properties. So I don't know the answer to that. We'll talk about it. When it comes to the budget, I do think that it is important for all the reasons that the council has articulated and staff has articulated, changing times.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You need to change your priorities. From 1999, we're a different city, I would say, because we're asked to talk about priorities. And in looking at the presentation, the one of the things that struck me, I mean, it's hard to quarrel with what is listed as high priority cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know that I would have graffiti. This is just something to consider as a medium priority over low what is considered low priority, which is garbage and litter. Because when I see and hear garbage, I'm not even sure what the difference is between garbage and litter, but someone can explain that to me another time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I do think about health and safety infestations, and I think protecting our health and safety of our community is important. I'm also a little unclear on what secondary priority cases are, but certainly when it comes to noise, I think noise is a health and safety issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we live in a noisy society and there are just layers of decibels accosting us from all sides. And so I think that is something that needs to to have particular attention. But again, that can be something for further discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would also like to know what, if anything, can be done about buildings, especially commercial buildings that have been long vacant. Last week I did a walk, a Webster Street walk with Linda Asbury, who's the executive director of the West Alameda Business Association.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And she walked me back a couple of spots, and I bet you I could point him out. And I said, Linda, remind me, how long is this one been vacant? Over ten years, more than one. So this is not a good thing for so many reasons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the question is, what can be done about that? Is that anything that could come within the purview of code enforcement? I think it's already been noted that when working with collection agencies, I don't even think it was as far back as ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I remember we had, you know, every stereotype you've heard about a collection agency we experienced. So we don't want to do that again. Don't call those folks who they were. But anyway, I would be inclined to to have a report, let's say, I guess, for being asked to recommend, to review the planning and to make a'",

I think the Vice Mayor stated that concern very well. At the same time, we we're finding that we're getting more of these habitability complaints because of renters now bringing these attention, these items to our attention.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the most part, our rental stock isn't getting any newer so that, you know, can be health and safety issues, too. So tell us how best to send this back to staff for next steps. Who would like to take a stab at that?'",

It'll give us a chance to think a little bit more about the priorities, think a little bit more about, inform you and the community, a little bit more about how we operate today and continue to develop our thinking around this idea of coordination, consolidation'",
        "'speaker_3': '. If we want to if you want to go down that road, what will it really take? Um, I mean, I think we've looked in a very cursory way, um, but I think that sets up a sort of mid-cycle conversation.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And it's it's almost impossible to prove. And so this is some of the the frustration staff has with the noise ordinance. I think it's time for us to go back and look at that and and part of this whole package, because that seems to be an ongoing issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's likely the issue the police have when they do it after hours.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And then to suddenly, you know, create this regime that's oriented towards this, the data is not there for it. It seems to me, yes, there are problem properties, but it seems to me that we have the capacity to deal with it.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, mayor and Council. This report continues the conversation with you about code enforcement. One of the stellar slides that you saw from the building official was that one of the immediate things that we are looking at is to streamline the administrative citation process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had an opportunity to look at that with our colleagues in the planning, building and Transportation Department. And we thought that like the priorities that were very old, the ordinance that authorizes administrative citations is quite old and needed updating.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this ordinance essentially accomplishes that purpose. It does not engage in major changes, but it makes clear that administrative citations can be issued for a full range of municipal code violations. It makes clear that when an administrative citation is issued, payment of the fine is not simply sufficient.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That one actually has to comply with the citation by abating the violation. It makes clear that once one receives a citation, that transfer of the property does not eliminate the citation. And these are just some of the many various enhancements that we're proposing to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I thought about administrative citations. It is an incredibly important tool in the code enforcement arena. And I think more and more so in recent years, court systems are incredibly congested, and it's not a realistic thing for cases to be filed in court.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the first opportunity, nor is it really fair to the underlying responsible party to not be given a lower risk opportunity to come into compliance and administrative citations is just that tool. It allows for more cases to be processed.'",

And when there is truly noncompliance, it allows the funnel to funnel down to the number of cases that really cannot be resolved through administrative citation and needs additional prosecutorial support.

        "'speaker_7': 'having some sort of a site citation? How that how that can be a. Or at least how it doesn't compound and become a problem. I'm not sure I entirely understand the question and the advance deposit, the way the waiver for the advance deposit essentially is to allow low income personnel to seek a waiver from having to deposit'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the fine. Yes, nothing accrues if there is a waiver. And so sorry, I understood that I meant once they are fined after the fact because this is the advance the advance deposit. But I guess the question is if they get the waiver for.'",

Someone will say, Oh, I need to appeal, but I don't have the financial wherewithal to deposit the fine.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So then they apply with the finance director to say, Can I not deposit the fine and contest my citation? And assuming it is proven, the finance director can say, okay, you don't have to deposit the fine and nothing is accruing other than the fine itself, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then they go through the hearing. They their appeal is unsuccessful and they now have a fine to pay. That's right. Right. And at some point in time, because we're talking about collection agencies and whatever else, their their start to be accruing of often accruing interest on those fines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. So so the late fees only accrue after a long period of nonpayment. And while the non that the the advance deposit just causes you to not have to deposit, that's all. And so let's say the hearing officer finds for the appellant, the appellant will be given a certain amount of time to pay, but let's say six'",
        "'speaker_7': 'months go by and nothing is deposited. At some point, fines start and penalty start accruing, right? Yes. And so that that's what I'm concerned about. I understand the advance deposit, but say with parking tickets, etc.. State analysis of what's happening with low income households.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They get a parking ticket or two. They go on. They go unpaid. They start a career in late fines and penalties, etc., to the point that that that actually they they can start, you know, people can start having thousands of dollars.'",

I guess I'm just asking, is there anywhere I didn't see it in here, but is there any any provision at this point in time?'",

        "'speaker_11': 'So you could do okay, but that would be 375,000. You could do that. I mean, if you want.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To do so, I would make that cumulative cap at three 300,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we've had a revised motion to have a cumulative cap on the number of settlements to 30 or selling liability claims up to $75,000. Do we have a second to that amended motion? Mm hmm. Yes. Okay. That's been seconded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, Mr. that Mr. Shand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll just share a couple of thoughts on this. One of them is that the counsel may, at a minimum, want to exempt workers compensation cases because those cases, as you probably have heard, generally involve very limited discretion and can have significant amounts, but very limited discretion and significant insurance coverage that may not make sense to be included'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the CAP. The council may want to also consider, for example, if you were to establish a cap to exempt personnel matters because for instance, the city manager more likely and myself with respect to folks in the city attorney's office in implementing our obligations to to manage the administrative service, may have a situation, for example, where there'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is a separation. And in that separation there may be a continuation of pay for a certain amount of time. And those are probably not what Councilmember de SAC is envisioning by acclamation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So personnel matters and what was the first one?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And worker's compensation matters. And so those would be my suggestion. One of the other inclusions in the staff report is that a third category you may want to exempt is any matter where excess insurance carriers already, where the claim pierces the excess insurance layer and excess insurance carriers have already indicated a settlement because if we reject the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'excess insurance settlement amount where excess layer is at risk, we risk loss of coverage completely, which would be somewhat devastating to the city's overall risk management process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually the okay, I just want to say, I don't quite understand what it is we would be accomplishing either. We trust the city manager and I guess the it is the city managers authority I believe to and the city attorney to settle liability claims up to 75,000 without having to come back to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we're trusting them with six of those, but not seven. I just it's confusing to me what we would be achieving. Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Um, matter to me. I share your concern. I think I'm less concerned with a cap than some sort of council. F Why I where there's and I would be more, I would be more open to a council if y I if there's going to be a number of settlements under that cap going into effect.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For instance, if for some instance you had a number of personnel issues and all of a sudden had, you know, a number that you were going to be passing through. So I would be I would be okay with that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we have we but if we had a council, if y then there could be a, you know, potential call for a review process or something like that. If there was some sort of concern that it could be raised and I would be more open to that than a, um, and again, I wouldn't want the details'",
        "'speaker_9': ', for instance, I wouldn't want the names of individuals or things like that. But, but just letting us know, just generally that settlements have gone through. That would be I'd be okay with that. I feel like it would be very difficult to have a cap because that seems to defeat the purpose of allowing the settlement authority.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I hear your concern, Councilmember De Sang about wanting to know about multiple expenditures. There's. And that's where I think an FBI would be helpful, perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, and along those lines, I mean, I would actually like to be advised, whenever you settle a case and maybe there could be the line at the end that says this, now, you know, we've now settled, you know, however many dollars, thousands of dollars in settlement this this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But and actually you do tend to give us those. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so we provide the council with an annual report on all settlements, which is an open session public staff report. And we are happy to continue to obviously provide that. And if the council wishes for a more up to date f why i I'm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly happy to commit to that. It sounds like the city manager is as well for anything that he would settle, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess where I'm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At some every day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So where I'm coming from is a you know, obviously it's always good to know, you know, at what point, you know, what where is the cumulative amount going. I mean, as a matter of information, it's always good to know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But B, without going into closed door sessions, I mean, it's altogether possible that this council or previous councils had dealt with on a closed door or matter things of this magnitude.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Desai, please excuse my interruption, but it's 1059 and we have to make a motion. We have one more item to consider, which is 9 a.m., which is actually my council referral.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I move that we we we waive time and hear that item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Do have a second. Okay. All in favor, I. Okay. All right. Yes. Continue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, it's altogether possible that previous city councils in closed door sessions had dealt with matter the the cost resolution of which was similar to what's being discussed right now as part of this item. Previous city council members, I mean, I don't know what the city council member like wouldn't say it out loud.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it seems to me my point be is it just seems odd that, you know, those things require closed door sessions and now it's completely possible that that well, if we adopt this this wouldn't it's it's like so it just seems odd.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because we didn't have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Okay, I think. I think I understand what you're saying. Do you want to? And I'll go to you in just a minute, Mr. Vice Mayor. But do either of you want to address what I think Mr. De was saying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That I think I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember de socks point is that by doing this, there will be less closed sessions. And I think that is right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, um. Okay. The Vice Mayor and then Councilmember Vella, did you get.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To the point I appreciate that there's an annual report, but I think there's a threshold. Maybe it's 20 or 25,000 at which I would want more more of an immediate we've settled for this amount. Just it becomes public.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would be good to know in that way if it became something that we were seeing a lot of, we would know quickly and be able to take action. The Council. My recommendation would be that Council give us direction tonight if that's what the Council's going to say, for example, that any settlement over 25,000, we provide you'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with an update within, let's say, five days of the settlement with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, I think I will. Let me let's hear from Councilor Brody because he's. We haven't heard much from you. I'm calling on you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Sorry. I mean, I'd be happy with moving that annual report to a quarterly report, if that's something you could do, that would give us a little more information, I guess. I mean, I do trust that you wouldn't settle something that you thought was frivolous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think there's also a certain subset of claims that many of us have expressed concern over. So I hope you would take that into consideration without, you know, ones that would cause our employee to be, like held liable or something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I think, you know what I'm saying. So, I mean, maybe you would not settle those. You would bring them even if it was for a smaller amount than 75,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so is your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I'm actually calling on the speakers and you're not the next one, Councilmember Vella, but I'll get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think part of the reason that we've heard some of these items in closed session is because this authority wasn't there previously. Um, but I, I think 25,000 is low and here's, here's in, in terms of getting enough why I, and here's why.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's a personnel matter where let's say you're negotiating, you know, basically a cash out of certain things or medical coverage or something like that, then you can you can hit 25,000 pretty quickly. And I, I just I am wary of it becoming a political thing where there's a temptation for council members to intervene politically somehow, and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'then it becomes a charter violation. So I, I do think there's certain personnel matters that that fall within in the scope of our designees. And I really don't want to have any. Even, you know, for anyone to even think that they could come to us on it, especially where there's a settlement involved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I do have some concerns over over having it be to especially over like a smaller amount. But I would be fine with it if I to me were, were if we're going to give you the authority, then I'd like to just give you the authority and then just, hey, give us enough y so that we know'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that there's been a settlement. I think giving a dollar amount makes it kind of weird, whereas if you just let us know, hey, we've settled it this matter. If you hear about it, I think that's more helpful, at least from my perspective, so that if it is in the press or something happens, we know there was a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'settlement that that was agreed to. So does that make sense? It's not really the dollar amount so much as just knowing that we've reached a settlement in some cases concluded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So maybe in the same week that it occurred, I mean, the city manager tends to give us weekly reports and the city attorney does before any closed session. So does does that count somebody and then decide, well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I second it so we can have a discussion, but I think I'm convinced that we don't need to put a cap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Daza. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the point is, after the reporting, if there's something things really wrong, then we put the case right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. What are we.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Seeing? Where we're saying that it's coming up all the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How about you, Vice Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's fine. Okay. Do I ever revise to have revised motion now? So I think I was hearing. But some have can stop me that we will approve this $75,000 limit to settle claims with the exceptions that the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't need exceptions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Need the exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For exemptions to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Reporting. Do you want to draw your motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd like to make a new motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make any motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like to move that. We pass the ordinance as drafted with direction to staff that that there be at Council F y when there's a settlement made.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll second that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd still like to see a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quarterly or a quarterly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Work within within a council of why within a week of the settlement. And do you want a quarterly report in addition to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, what's the litigation report? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's annual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's annual.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And could could we get in at perhaps get an update in the mid-year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Six months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perhaps or. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't want to because I don't think we wanted too much extra work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so then it would be part of the midyear and then. And then the budget?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So do we. Are we clear on that motion? Are you, madam?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cleared the next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear what the code says.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That you're introducing. The ordinance is drafted with direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That there be a council fire within a week of the settlement. And then you've just decided that what you want is just an update as part of the mid-year budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mid-Year and annual.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mid-Year and annual budget. So Semiannually.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So yeah. So I think that that works. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we have a motion. Do we have a second? Okay, move. Councilmember Vela, seconded by Councilmember de SAC. All in favor. I oppose your abstained. The motion passes unanimously. Thanks, everyone. Good discussion. Okay. Item seven City Manager, Communications.'"
