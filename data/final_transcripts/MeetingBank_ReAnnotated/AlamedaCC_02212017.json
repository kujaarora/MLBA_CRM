    "Status Update on the Enterprise District Development Approach.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries unanimously so five d. Angela. How about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Members of the council and mayor and vice mayor. I'm Angela hawk about i've lived here for seven years now and I'm here talking about five D because it is a commercial development at site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is meant to be the site, a business.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Park. And maybe I'm a little late to the party, but I don't believe California should be building any business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Parks anymore unless they incorporate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Housing. And I don't necessarily understand what putting it on the consent the agenda means, but we need all the housing we can get. And I just wanted this opportunity to bring it to your attention that this is an opportunity to leverage commercial development for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I believe that the Council did prioritize housing at their last Friday meeting. And I think this is an opportunity to do a new direction for not just Alameda, but for the state as a whole. We should not be building business parks without housing, especially without affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Much. Thank you. All right. So on five D do we have a staff member that wants to speak to that? We speak to it because. Jennifer Isaac So and if you could share in regards to point our obligation to the Navy and what the deal is and we punch in house jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sure. Jeremy Mayer, Council members. Jennifer Bass, Refuse Director. So I want to just zoom out a little bit because the area that the the point of the staff report is just one part of a much larger mixed use development.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I made a point. There are about 1400 housing units that are been zoned for Alameda Point in general. This area is an area that is focused on jobs. The when the base closed, the city of alameda lost about 18,000 jobs, which actually kind of created an imbalance really between jobs and housing in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And there is always been and really kind of the underpinnings of the no cost conveyance agreement with the Navy was to replenish those jobs, to try to essentially mitigate those impacts that the Navy caused when it left and we lost all those jobs.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so the bottom line is the agreement that we have with the Navy is to focus on a mixed use community with a real focus on replenishing the jobs that were lost or trying to bring back some of the jobs that were lost at the time that the Navy closed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that was called an economic development conveyance. And the city has that agreement. And that was one of the kind of conditions of the city getting the land for free from the Navy was to make sure that it gave a lot of attention to trying to replace the jobs lost during the during the closure of the base'",
        "'speaker_12': '. I do want to say is that it is we do plan for a mix of uses you know 1400 housing units right now. Zero of those units have been built and we're working really hard to get units built.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But, you know, they're this is a 20 to 30 year plan, but there's 1400 housing units planned for the larger Alameda point. And then quite a bit of making sure that we have some land available and zoned for commercial development as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Does that answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The record also in regards to the no cost conveyance? If we build more than 1400 homes, then we must pay 50,000 per unit. That's built in addition, is that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That is correct. 50,000 of that 50,000 per unit inflated over time according to an index. So from the time that we. But yes, we'd have to pay 50,000 to the Navy essentially for for land for the for the land that the Navy transferred.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And we also built all of the general plan currently zones that property 1425 but we would have to redo that. We'd have to pay that additional amount.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, vice council member matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think this explains this quite well. The whole point of reuse of both military bases was to replace the jobs that were being lost and to recognize. And that's where the 1400 unions recognize the need for jobs, housing balance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And our target has always been jobs that are well-paid and jobs to replace those that left when the Navy left. And we also keep in mind and there's a dynamic here that when those jobs left, the houses didn't leave with them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're playing catch up. But we also have to catch up with the additional need. And I think. Recognizing this is the enterprise zone, also recognizing that there are some contaminated areas within site B that are unsuitable for housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think that this plan, which is developed over the last 17 years, is a solid plan and I move that we approve item five D.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mind if I say something? Thank you. Thank you for your explanation. Miss it. And I. I think I probably speak for everyone on the council to say that housing and a lot of affordable housing is a very high priority that came out of our priority setting workshop the other day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But Councilmember Matariki is right that when way back when I was on the planning board and we did the zoning and the entitlements, there's a reason why certain uses are slated for certain areas and we have designated the cleanest areas around me 2.4 where housing will go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with that, I'll just say there is some pretty exciting conversations taking place that aren't quite ready to be introduced to the public, but for how some very well needed housing can be can be provided. But when it comes to affordable housing, well, just talking about the Enterprise District, we will hear an item later on the agenda'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about the economic development, the updated strategic plan update. And one of the concerns that was raised and it concerns me is that the city is now acting as its own developer for this enterprise zone. So we're doing request for proposals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'RFP is trying to find folks, industries, you know, acceptable kinds of clean tech light industry to come out. But yet we also require of our developers that they pay a very steep price per acre because they have to help to replace that aging infrastructure, everything water, sewer, telephone, electrical, you name it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's providing an impediment to the business interests when it comes to funding affordable housing. And yet another item we'll hear tonight is an update on our legislative agenda at both the state and federal level. We've got to beat the Bushes and find funding sources for the affordable housing that we very much need to build.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's not that we're putting one interest above the other, but we are operating off of a plan that is going to help the city remain economically viable to get this base redeveloped so that it allows us to do the many things we want to and need to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, though, for raising that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other councilmember comments? There's a motion on second. All those in favor. I am curious. Unanimously. Thank you. Five G and. Member matters, he has to recuse himself because he lives within a certain area. Oh, and. Vice mayor also.'"

    "Update and Direction on Negotiations with Friends of the Alameda Animal Shelter.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'He's instructing staff to provide an update on the negotiations between the city and friends of the Alameda Elliman animal shelter at the March seven City Council meeting. And to if a memorandum of understanding has not been reached between the city and that Council provide direction on the terms of an email.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You and I brought this all because of the last council meeting. Right before the start, I was asked to announce that the item would not be on the agenda for today, which I thought it would be. And when I asked, Is there a new date, there was no date set.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think it's important to for us to get an update. And and honestly, it's been eight months or something like that of negotiations. I think it's time to set the terms. So now we have speakers as Swati Shah and Marcy Pearce and Tenzin Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You may think each get 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello, everyone. It's been a long night, so I will save my remarks for the next council meeting. But I really hope that the attention that was paid tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To all the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Other very important issues will be focused on the shelter soon. Some time. Because as much as I love trees, as much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As I love what our city does.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People come first to me and my animals are second. And so we spend.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of time on a lot of other issues. And so I very much look forward to a healthy discussion similar to we had about other subjects today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be about the shelter, hopefully at the next meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Marcy Morrison Pearce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. Councilman. I'm Mattie and I began volunteering back in 2009 when Maddie needed some community volunteer credits in middle school. At that time, the shelter was run by the police department and the volunteer program was minimal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back then there were about 15 active volunteers, including us, and we came to find out from a friend later there was a list of people who wanted a call about volunteering. They never got called from the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back then, I really didn't know much about the rescue movement. We were blissfully unaware of things like euthanasia rates. We didn't wonder why we didn't get much training at all before we worked with the animals. We didn't question why there were no other volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we were there, we didn't ask what happened to the animals when there were no volunteers allowed in on holidays or days when the shelter was closed. Now enlightened by the rescue teaching we've received through fires, we see problems existed when the animal shelter was run by the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's more word to 2012 when FAS took over and formal training was instituted for volunteers. We started learning about animal enrichment, using and improving what seemed like wasted time an animal spends behind a kennel door. Working with the dogs to make them friendlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More responsive to people. More obedient, more adoptable. Hence the lower euthanasia rate that's been admired throughout the country. It doesn't happen by accident. It happens because volunteers have that intention. As a volunteer, once a week we come in, we walk dogs, we play with them, we clean up their puppy kennels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have also been involved with the foster program. We kept two tiny Chihuahua pups in our house for almost a month, raising them to get used to human touch and interaction. We adopted a little terrier mix that fell in love with me at the shelter, and my parents fell in love with him on my dad's 80th birthday'",
        "'speaker_2': ', a week after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. We put a bow on Smiley's head and he became the best present my dad ever got. And I believe that dog kept him out of the assisted living for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, smiley is the love of my mom's life. I have chased a little Chihuahua who escaped from a harness from the Grant Street Marina through the city's vehicle carwash. I have been the object of Chase from a pit bull who escaped from a kennel and just wanted a good walk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I tell you all this not to tell my own horn, not to toot my own horn, but to impress upon you this. And this is the important thing. Of all the volunteers I see on a monday afternoon, I do the very least.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the kind of volunteer force we have. It's a strength of our volunteer force. About 300 strong. That makes for us great. I haven't even told you about the many, many hours Ophelia and Frances put in to raise money for their shelter out the night that many of you attended.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The night on the Hornet. Volunteer hours were converted into a money figure. Even at minimum wage, thousands and thousands of dollars we put into this shelter. If the police department takes over this place, that shelter is, will the volunteer force remain as strong?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will the police department recruit train coordinates, sustain and support the force of volunteers and make the shelter a great place for animals and for the community. It didn't happen when I was there, when I worked with the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Didn't happen. Getting involved is not only good for the animals, but for the community. And I know that bell rung. So let me tell you, Alameda is a progressive place. Lead us forward. You are leaders, as you said, Councilman Matarese.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We look forward. We don't look back to the time that the city had a pound. That's not what alameda is. Value. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And lastly. Marjorie. Marcy, next time, please turn in this clip for you and Matty. Both of you have sat there all these hours and it could have been 6 minutes and then I wouldn't have had the feedback. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You need a location for 11.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Uh, so we need a motion to continue past 11.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Although I favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries. Thank you for coming down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's like Tenzan version.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. My name is Tenzin Peterson. I'm 11 years old, and I began.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Volunteering.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the Alameda Animal Shelter last year. I really care about animals and believe that they make very good friends and companions. I believe it is the city's responsibility to care for animals and make sure they are treated well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want the city to accept this proposal because forces saving animals lives. It will be able to send 95% of the animals in the shelter to loving homes. It costs less for farmers to run the shelter than if the city ran it and was doing a great job taking care of all of its animals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I urge you to accept Foster's proposal of $908,000 and keep the animal shelter open. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Patricia Phillips and then Deb Knowles. Then Susan Feltman. Gettleman. GETTLEMAN And those were my last slips on this item. If you want to speak on the side of, please submit your.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. My name is Pat Phillips and I've been a feline volunteer for a couple of years. Purpose, sorry. In last.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Year I've.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seen a lot of kids being surrendered because people, their owners are moving and they can't take them with them. Or even worse, they've been abandoned. If you just surrender your pet for whatever reason, wouldn't you want to take it to a place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're going to be taken care of and they're going to be safe where they're going to get a second chance? If force does not receive the funds they need to maintain quality of service, I'm afraid that this will this will affect their live release rate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if they lower this rate for no doubt we'll lose a lot of the volunteers. I mean, as a volunteer, I wouldn't want to come in for my ship to find out that one of my favorite healthy, lovable, adoptable shelter buddies is not on the adoption board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's gone. So please consider this. When you make your funding decision, it's the right thing to do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Deb Nelson and Susan, I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here's Pat.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Hi. My name is Susan Gettleman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would like to speak in support of the FAA's funding request. Members of the City Council. I know that the city has received detailed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Financial information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From FAS about the cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of running the shelter properly and humanely, and about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why the FAS.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Proposal makes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Economic sense for the city. I'm not here to talk about those details.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm here to talk about my personal experience.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I love being a volunteer at FAS. In the past three and a half years, I volunteered almost 1800 hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the shelter. I love the time I spend interacting with the animals at the shelter, and I love the camaraderie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That I share with staff and with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Other volunteers, all of whom support and appreciate one another and have a passion for the well-being of animals of each animal that comes into the shelter. I see staff working far beyond the call of duty to keep the shelter running.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As it should be run, not because it's just a job, but because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're committed to the humane treatment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adaptability of the animals at the shelter. And I see a large and devoted group of volunteers who have been a key part of the shelter's successful performance over the past five years through the collective efforts of its board staff and volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'FAS now provides medical care.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Behavioral assessments, daily socialization and exercise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Improved adoption rates for the city's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stray.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Abandoned, neglected and surrendered animals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm proud to be associated with Fox and its mission. I'm grateful for the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Opportunity to be an active and appreciated member of the community. And I would like to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be proud of my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'City of Alameda for providing us with a level of funding it needs in order to continue. Buzz is a well-run organization with honest, hardworking and dedicated staff members and volunteers, and all of them deserve respect and full support from the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Deb Nelson, and she's the last speaker on this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yvonne Last but last but not least. Good evening, Madam Mayor. And Council. Pardon me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They've the best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Class. Well, maybe. Maybe not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So what I'm here for? I'm Deb Knowles. I'm the president of the board of directors for FAS. And I guess there's been a fair bit of misunderstanding, miscommunication about where things are. From my perspective with with our negotiations and I'd like to set this set the record straight this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, our proposal is for 908,000, and our total fund funding to include fundraising is a million for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not.'",
        "'speaker_2': '1,000,009. In terms of staffing. We are not proposing that the executive director or the operations manager get a pay raise. We are proposing that our staff, those are our hourly employees, receive a 6% pay raise. We are also not recommending that we add four staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are proposing that we add one staff. So that's where we are today. That's not where we were a year ago when we began this journey. But that is exactly where we are today. And I guess what I would do is I'd urge you to to to direct staff to update the website.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a lot of information there that is very dated at this point. And we want to make sure that we're.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Going down the going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Down the road together. And I think that if we had more accurate information out there, that it certainly would help us have a more constructive process going forward. And finally, we had some really good news today. We've been working with the city manager's suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been talking with APC and we have hammered out a draft menu to begin working with them on an ongoing basis. So we're kind of excited about that. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And APC. And I wanted to share in Apex Alchemy two point collaborative. For those that don't know. All right. So I brought this referral asking that Steph provide an update at the next council meeting March 7th and during the public meeting so the public can all speak on the agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we could give feedback and that if an M you had not been reached by that time, that we give direction to staff on the terms of the M or you between the city and us. And I brought this because as we heard from the speaker, this has been going on for a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually brought my first referral on this item back on July 6th, so that's eight months ago. Council gave direction five months ago at the first in October 4th. And I think that it's critical that we way we as council receive an update in a public meeting and then we can have our public comments on the substance'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the referral and give direction if necessary, on the terms so that we can move forward and be done with this. And I think it's critical. I think a year, eight months, five months, it's plenty of time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thanks to everyone for speaking in. I'll also disclose it. A couple Saturdays ago, my husband and I went down and spent a couple of hours at the shelter and it looks great. The volunteers, the staff are doing a great job.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The place looks great and we even took a dog out for a walk, which was fun, I think, for all of us. But I. I just want to clarify when the mayor says, Mayor Spencer, when you say this has been going on for over a year, but it's my understanding that the city just got the financials back'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in January. And so it's hard to do negotiation when you don't have everything in front of you. But that said, I'm feeling that there's been a lot of progress. I mean, I do keep in touch with the different board members and their consultant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm also aware that this item is it's a contract and it's appropriate that a contract be heard in closed session. And in fact, at our next council meeting on March 7th, it's on the closed session agenda. So I, I think that both sides I commend you for I can I can tell that, you know, progress is being'",
        "'speaker_4': 'made. And between now and March 7th, there just might be even more progress to report to us in closed session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd actually like so in regards to it's on the closed session agenda. That agenda has not gone out. And I know we had been told it was actually going to be on the agenda for this meeting and then it got canceled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think it's critical that we have some certainty that it is actually going to be heard, which seems to be a moving ball moving target. Any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I just would like to say that there has been movement in both sides towards the middle. And the details now are. Much, much smaller and more approachable than they have been in the past. And I feel like there is goodwill on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And there is no question at all from that point of view about the good job that Ford has done. I live release great, good volunteers, just as Councilmember Ashcroft said, and the city does not intend to bring it back into the police department.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we don't intend to take over an operation that has been done so successfully by the friends of the Alameda Animal Shelter. So that said, we are working on the details in between. And the closed session is to talk about price and terms from the council's point of view.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That March 7th.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that is scheduled for March 7th. Ideally, if we got input from the council in closed session, then we could go back and meet with the FAS board and then come back soon after that, if that is the preference of the FAS board and the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're matariki.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That sounds reasonable. The one thing I don't want to have happen. Can you also say again that the police department's not going to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The Alameda Police Department and there's a smile over there and has no intention and will not take over the the Alameda animal shelter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the second thing that I'd like to get a commitment on is I don't want to hear. Or get an email while we're going through this process that there's a sign up on the door saying the shelters close because there's no money.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've had that conversation with the board and the feeling is that there is enough funds to get us through. The end of April, I think is what the last conversation we had. If there is an issue, we have also said that we will make sure that the animals are cared for and continue on with a process in'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the interim until a decision is made on the details. So the employees are secure and the animals are secure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and then lastly, I think it's very important because with all the good intentions in 2012 to save the city money and to to get a a knowledgeable animal care group running the a a shelter, not just a dog or animal control facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It didn't anticipate the actual costs. And I think. Looking at the actual costs and and having that good discussion between city staff and force management to narrow down truly what the budgets are and what the projections are. I think we'll be in a better place than if we rush something through and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's all said that in the backdrop that you're saying that we're going to have an update at the next meeting. And my expectation is with that direction, go into a room and don't come out until we have a deal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just like any other contract, it's done in good faith where the negotiators at the table prepare a contract for the city council to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't think it conflicts. I think we can have an item on clothes that we are all privy to and we can still have an item on the open agenda where we provide an update to the people and the people can weigh in on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I have no problem. I have no problem with it. But in open session, direct giving direction and open session I think is a bad idea and it's not good faith bargaining, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you also.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So we have informed the FAS staff that have been engaged with us in negotiations that March 7th. We will be getting hopefully what, some final direction from the city council. And based on that, we believe quickly we can work with with the force staff to get the document drafted, which we've already started trying to do the preparations'",

And, you know, frankly, I mean. I think many of us are in this position where we've been speaking with folks on both sides and there's open lines of communication.'",

That's the reason why we negotiate price in terms and in closed session, whether it be a labor contract or a lease or this, which I think is a substantial contract.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I it was going to be on this agenda and then for some reason it was removed. But I think our public is entitled to an update and I think that we can keep it on, we can put it on the agenda, and if we don't need it, then there would be nothing to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we have a deal, we don't have a deal. I think we need to have a discussion about what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, the problem with us meeting in closed session and getting price and terms is then we don't give the opportunity for the FAS board to take that information and see if it works and work it out and then come back as a partnership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I understand. And Councilmember Ortiz pointed at the same time, I don't think that we as as a city council can really tell our citizens whether or not to communicate, you know, this but but.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Whether it's from one side or the other, is not helpful and it does not create an atmosphere of mutual trust and bargaining.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So well, I think we can tune out some of the background noise and we'll all rise above this when we get that resolution that I think we're this close to getting. So at this point, I Madumere this was your item.'",

Well, while I was going door to door this fall, who were adversely impacted by that, and I think, again, this is we're talking about taxpayer money.

        "'speaker_0': 'I have a clarifying question. I asked that at this point through the chair because the first asked direct staff to identify all accounts with Wells Fargo and Investments. Okay. And then they would come back with that information. Then we would decide if we wanted to actually divest at that point.'",

You know, that that says it may not be feasible for, you know, account X, Y or Z, but on those that it might be feasible for'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I think we should we should be socially responsible with, you know, what I think as millions of dollars of of our citizens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my question, though, is on number three, it says direct staff to exclude, which I appreciate that in the second part of this, we would be directing staff to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo Securities for a period of three years or until they come back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we'll have that discussion. That's the way this is written.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'I my hope is that we're not making any investments with Wells Fargo starting tonight and that we can reevaluate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It in three years. Or is it when they come back once?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's how I'm interpreting it, is that this is a referral. The question is whether to bring all the data and information back to the council. And in the meantime, between now and when we bring that referral back for the larger discussion, we won't make any additional direct investments into Wells Fargo out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think that's so.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That's what.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it's late. And this is a big one for me. Standing Rock was never just about the North Dakota pipeline. And Wells Fargo is not just about the North Dakota pipeline either. What we what we see and what we as a minor example of what's happening nationally and internationally is we're watching these massive financial institutions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before, we never really had to watch what they were doing. We kind of invested our money and thought, they're going to take care of it. They'll take care of it. Well, over time, what's happened is that we're discovering, we're finding out through the information that's coming our way in the past year in particular, that many of these'",
        "'speaker_2': 'investments are going to things that are totally socially irresponsible, like the Dakota Access pipeline. Now, why do I say that? Because this has to do with massive corporate interests who would sacrifice people and land call it the planet on the altar of very short term profit and gain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is critical. Now, Wells Fargo is not the only bank, as you know. I think there are 38 banks that are funneling money into the Dakota Access pipeline right now. Some more, some less. But Bank of America, for example, is investing heavily in fossil fuel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what they tried to do is try to paint themselves green by making plans for all the branches to be carbon neutral by 2020, which is a great idea. Nice solar panels on these panels of drive up teller windows.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this is basically meaningless when you stack it up against Bank of America's leading lending portfolio, which is chock full of loans to develop extreme fossil fuels, which are simply incompatible with climate. Stick with a climate stable world, and that's where we need to be headed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is no question about that. If there is a fiduciary responsibility with these massive institutions that has now expanded to a responsibility to maintain the health of this planet the weather, the air, the water we drink.

I applauded fully back Vice Mayor Veloso and council members on proposal to discontinue banking with Wells Fargo.

For example, Barclays, ARBs, Citigroup, Chase and JPMorgan have pled guilty to felony price fixing chargers rigging the LIBOR.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The LIBOR is the London Interbank Rate Exchange. Variable rate mortgages here and in the in in England are based on that and based on that rate.

        "'speaker_3': 'There was a bill in Congress in the House in 2015 to eliminate Dodd-Frank. So this this should worsen as things are deregulated. Derivative exposure is important. The 2005 Federal Bankruptcy Act gave derivatives super priority over depositor funds. So if and when a major bank files for bankruptcy, depositor funds will be taken to cover the banks derivative debts'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It used to be that depositor debts were paid off first, and then any other debts of the banks were paid off in the in the event of a bankruptcy. Here's an article from Stanford Law, Law Review and Harvard Law School talking about derivative exposure.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Depositor funds were used to settle bank debts. That's this paper. It's geeky, but it's interesting reading. The major banks are simply too risky to have as a business partner. I urge the city to use. Can I have a couple more minutes?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I urge the city to use. I urge the city not to use any of the large commercial banks and to use a local credit union. We have First United Services Credit Union here on the island founded in 1932.'",

The cost is as is investing in fossil fuels. A local credit union keeps deposit money local in the sense that loans are made locally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Using local dollars. Depositing Alameda money in a local credit union keeps our community wealth local and helps build our economy. If not for us, United Credit Services and another nonprofit credit union, I believe is the best choice for a banking business.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to Wells Fargo.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Creating fraudulent accounts and financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Another reason the city should divest from the bank is that it finances for profit prisons. So some quick background on for profit prisons. But the story. In Idaho, there was a prisoner named Honey, a lobbied, who was incarcerated for robbing a drug store for oxycodone.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In prison, he ironically helped expose a drug ring between the correctional officers and the prisoners for his own safety. He was then put in solitary confinement. But as soon as he returned to his cell block, Haney was beaten nearly to death, suffering immediate brain damage.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And two years later, he died. And Honey died because core civic. The company that controlled the Idaho Correctional Center valued profit above human life. And as revealed by court documents, core civics business model in Idaho was to save money by understaffing the prison and instead giving control of the facility to prisoner gangs, causing violence to skyrocket.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And what happened to Hani is not a one off incident. Instead, it's woven into the fabric of how private prisons operate. Across the country, for profit prisons are plagued with violence. The the they neglect the medical needs of prisoners and their rife with other human rights abuses.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And I think most alarmingly, because they profit off his incarceration, private prison companies make business decisions that lead to more people behind bars. So that brings us to today. And for much of the last year, I research the report titled The Banks that Finance Private Prison Companies that I emailed to all of you guys.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It reviewed SEC filings from the past ten years from the two largest prison companies or Civic and GEO Group. And it found that private prison companies operate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As they do, largely because Wells Fargo.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Finances their debts. As of last June, Wells Fargo was part of a syndicate of banks that had loaned C, C Corps Civic and Geo Group A combined $1.3 billion. Wells Fargo also underwrote $144 million of Angel Group's bonds and was the trustee for all four of Geo Group's bond offerings.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'By financing private prisons. Wells Fargo is not only promoting the abusive practices of private prisons, such as what happened in Ohio, but they're also promoting and profiting from mass incarceration. I believe that no corporation should profit from the incarceration of human beings.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And Wells Fargo should cease its support of this abominable practice. And for this reason, my organization in the public interest is calling on all clients and shareholders of Wells Fargo to end their relationships with the bank. I look forward to what happens here.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'I think the Treasurer has put out a very good point. I certainly don't want to have the city own. If part owner of a company that defrauded people runs private prisons and. The more I find out, the worse it gets.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think that I think that's the point. But the second point is. Where does the money go, if not there? And that's where a policy that is not directed at specifics of Wells Fargo. But what our standard is, is we can't move the money someplace else without understanding how we measure the new location or the new'",
        "'speaker_7': 'institution that's going to handle the money. So I think in the interim, we say no more investments in Wells Fargo and we await for that policy update so that we can. Make it. Take the the the money and place it someplace that's acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So that it's very late. I could just be. I is way past my bedtime. It sounds the two different things. So the question is, between now and when we approve a policy that reflects whatever conclusions that we come to as far as how we want to address this issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Should we instruct staff and the people handling the money on a daily basis that we want no more money going that direction? I think on the operational basis that would be very difficult, clearly. But investment wise, my again, my recommendation would be that we have a thoughtful, formal approach to how we want to deal with this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my side is the investment said the operational said, I think, you know, staff and our finance director will know that. But but in terms of the investment side, that we address that comprehensively. And not temporarily, if that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If. Is that. Is that. I think I'm agreeing with you. Is that okay? We're not going to put any more money there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Meaning we're not going to buy any more Wells Fargo Securities. That's right. As opposed to putting any more money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's no, the difference between being an owner is one thing. Being a customer is another thing and how you how you we don't have anything to base on how we're how what it would mean to change as a customer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we need that information to understand. How to have that, how to set those parameters. But it's to me, it's fairly simple. On the investment side is we're not going to buy any more securities. Until we have criteria, we can't move the securities that we have someplace else until we know how to measure the someplace'",
        "'speaker_7': 'else. Is that me? Is that clear? It is, but it sounds a little bit different than what the vice mayor was maybe saying. And again saying what I'm saying. Yeah. So so I guess in a yes or no way tomorrow morning, should we be calling the money managers saying don't buy any more Wells Fargo Securities?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's, I would say, more structured.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, I think that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that we would not be purchasing any new securities and that you come back with a plan in regards to divesting the current investments in the six weeks when you come back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just curious if that's what I'm hearing. That wasn't really agenda, right?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, the way the referral.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Detailed question to be handled on the quarter after 12, but it's relatively important because I don't want.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To look at look at the wording of the referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, this actually said that for a period of three years or a.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Period of three years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, you know, it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that seems somewhat arbitrary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it does. So we should be okay. But I'm going to ask.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A strong staff to exclude Wells Fargo from the RFP process described and to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities period of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three years. And I think we could actually modify that until further counsel direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Until further direction. So that's where I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Does that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, because we do that. We take action sometimes on something like this. We just did earlier sending a letter. It didn't have to come back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To the attorney.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think you can. You can because it does say refrain for the next three years. I guess I don't mean to be argumentative and it is past midnight, but if I would just to help, I don't know. I'm helping her or making it worse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if I understood the city treasurer, he was hoping to give direction to the investment folks with the investment policy and not make a phone call tomorrow morning. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just think I understand completely what we're aiming for. I think the the way to do it is through the investment policy, which addresses not only what we do going forward, but also what we have currently. And this is just the investments, not the operating stuff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I just I I'm not sure verbal instruction is going to be quite honestly, is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Enough.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To ensure that this is executed. I think we will need some sort of written instruction. So really what we're doing, I guess, in essence, is it quarter after 1224 told us we're modifying our investment policy formally through this referral if we if we do it effective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right now, which, again, I don't have a problem with that. I'm not sure if that was the intention. I just wanted to be clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So personally, I would think that we could at least give the verbal direction and then we can hammer out. That doesn't if it isn't sufficient, then we'll get the update in six weeks and do more. But at this point, I've heard a majority and I'm going to say, which is what I came back to originally, that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is not to to refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities until further counseled direction. So do we have a motion?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll make that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the motion is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well to move the entire referral. But then with that amendment that you just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To counsel until further direction from counsel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We say it again so we know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the referral is here. Consider directing staff to one identify all accounts with Wells Fargo and investments in Wells Fargo Securities to draft a request for proposal RFP for banking services for the city of Alameda. Three Exclude Wells Fargo from the RFP process and refrain from making new investments in Wells Fargo securities until further counsel direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Period. Right. That's your motion. I'm going to second of all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I passed this unanimously. Thank you. Council member Communications. And Brody.'"
