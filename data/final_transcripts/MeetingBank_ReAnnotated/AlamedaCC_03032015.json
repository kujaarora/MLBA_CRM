    "Lease Agreement and Temporary Right of Entry Permit with WETA for Alameda Point Property.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, mayor and city council members. I'm Ninette Mercado in the Community Development Based Fees Department. Tonight, we're asking you to approve a six year lease with the Water Emergency Transportation Authority for its maintenance and operation center. If approved, this project will mark the first new construction to occur on Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The proposed project would provide maintenance services such as fueling engine oil changes, concession supply and light repair work for the LEDA ferryboats operating in the central San Francisco Bay. In addition to the proposal. In addition, the proposed project would be the location for operation activities of Weta, including day to day management and oversight of services, crew and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'facilities in the event of a regional disaster. The facility would also function as an emergency operations center, serving passengers and sustaining water transit services for emergency response and recovery. The site selected as an area transferred referred to as Term one, which is property always owned by the city but was formerly leased to the Navy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The Navy had tight control of the area until around 2001, when they extinguished the lease and removed improvements at the city's request. The area is also part of the state title and so it's restricted for maritime and water related uses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We two staff will walk you through the improvements they're proposing for the property on the land and water side. I will describe the details of the transaction. We will be paying a base rent of approximately of $5,125. The city's development impact fee for all Me two point is 9790 $956 per acre, and potential developers can opt to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'install their fair share of infrastructure improvements as outlined in the master infrastructure plan. In lieu of paying that fee, in other words, and acres worth of improvements for every acre of land, we will be installing infrastructure instead of paying that impact fee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Using the fee structure, we just landside obligation would be $714,640 because their landside improvements comprise 0.73 acres. Recognizing that there is some water side impact. Staff negotiated $2.5 million in infrastructure included in the master infrastructure plan because we too also will be leasing 3.4 acres of submerged parcels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The most significant improvement will be the installation of the $1 million water line running from the base to the water main on Pacific Avenue. This will be the first line on Alameda Point Water line on Alameda Point that will be in compliance with East Bay mud standards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Other master infrastructure plan improvements include a portion of the waterfront park contributing to the reconfiguration of Main Street and flood protection improvement. Approving the list tonight will only give way to the real estate right to develop the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also will need to go through the planning board for use, permit and project conditions. They currently are scheduled to go to the Planning Board on March 23rd. At that meeting, the planning board will determine use conditions. I think that's an important point to make, to remind the community that the planning board will be making decisions about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this project and more specifically because of a phone call I receive later today regarding concern over the height of the proposed building. After conferring with the city planner, I was informed that the proposed building is 65 feet tall, and the height restriction in that district of the of the base is 100 feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For further frame of reference, the USS Hornet is 190 feet to the top of its mass. So the scale of the building is not out of line with its surroundings. Also keep in mind that the long term lease with the Department of Transportation Maritime Administration anticipates that there'll be a new warehouse adjacent to the piers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the existing warehouse is torn down for development. So there potentially would be another structure of similar size in the vicinity. The issue that is most discussed in the public arena is the removal of the seal haul out at the project in the project area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over the years of negotiating this project. Harbor SEALs have established a hall out area on the old dilapidated pier, which is approximately 80 feet long. After all of your environmental consultations and conferring with the city's biologists, there doesn't seem to be an impact in removing the hall out entirely, especially given the ample hull out available on the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'nearby breakwater. However, there are community concerns for which we too has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to locate, design and construct an alternate hull out via a negotiated MRU with the city. The reason we're not bringing the menu to you tonight or an additional approval is because we need to determine the appropriate location for the facility'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and be mindful that we don't create another unwanted environmental impact on the waterfront affecting other species, creating obstacles to additional waterfront improvements such as a small marina or an additional ferry terminal. We just don't know yet. We don't want to put the hull out in a place that will tie our hands later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Finally, staff is able to recommend the approval of this project for several reasons. First, consistency with the general plan and zoning designations for the property. This is in the Alameda Point Enterprise Zoning District, which is to support maritime uses consistent with the Public Trust Exchange Agreement, provide land for employment and business uses and residential use of this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'land is not permitted. Because of disaster preparedness as an island community with limited access to the to the region, Alameda must do everything it can to prepare for a major disaster. It will be a major benefit to the residents of Alameda to be home of Guido's EOC and the region's ferry boats in December of last year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I attended a half day meeting with the fire chief, public works director and representatives from DC and regional FEMA offices to tour Alameda Point. The Wheeler facility played a significant role in the response and access planning for the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alternate transportation services. This facility is an important step towards ensuring a strong partnership between the community and the regional ferry provider. Investment in Alameda Point. This project will take a small parcel of land and invest 45 to $50 million in construction of the facility and infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public Park and Bay Trail Improvement Plan will align the Bay Trail to its long term placement, and the project will improve the adjacent adjacent public park area. I hope that you can support this recommendation tonight, and I'm going to turn the discussion over to Kevin Connolly, the manager of Planning and Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Nanette. It's been a pleasure working with Annette on this project. My name is Kevin Connolly. I'm the manager of planning and development for the Water Emergency Transportation Authority. With me tonight is Michael Garrity, who is the project manager for this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're happy to answer any questions you may have, which is going to run through a quick overview of the project. As Ninette said, really, I'm not going to add more than what she's already discussed. This is a rendering of our building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as you said, it's just below 70 feet tall. It's about three stories. If you include or do not include a mezzanine, the third story is the emergency operations center, which is a key part of this and function of this building today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our emergency operations center that we use in the event of any natural disaster would be our San Francisco facility on Pier nine, which is woefully inadequate in terms of its size and scale and functionality. This would be our center centerpiece for emergency operations in the whole Bay Area when it is complete.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look at the next one. I got.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Here's an overview of the facility. There would be berthing space for 12 vessels here. All the auto vessels are used in Alameda service. So these are Alameda Main Street Harbor Bay and South San Francisco service. South San Francisco is sometimes forgotten among alameda commuters, but we have a healthy proportion of of our commuters to south San Francisco'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are coming from Alameda origins. So those are the 1212 for the 12 berths for our vessels on the water side that's a little bit over three acres of of overwater lands. Their power supported floating docks. They do not represent actual actual construction on the water they're floating.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they can be and will be removed on an occasional basis for cleaning and and and maintenance. There's also a maintenance facility, the major facility proper, which is mainly a light industrial light maintenance facility. Oil changes fueling light maintenance are heavy mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This really takes place that bay ship on the estuary as well as in seaport as in shipyards up and down the West Coast. Seattle and San Diego have typically done our major maintenance work. One area where our service is really at vulnerable is we only have one day's worth of fuel at any given time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This facility will allow us to have up to five days storage of fuel in the event of a natural disaster and the ferries will be relied upon to serve the Bay Area. We will need those five days of fuel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We cannot really survive with only one day's of fuel. As the net said, the key infrastructure improvements here. One is the Bay Trail that runs along east west along Hornet Avenue. The second is the park area, which is just immediately to the east of our site that we are improving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Third is the main is the water main that's coming from Pacific. And fourth, we didn't mention is we're actually providing $250,000 towards improvements for parking at the Main Street terminal. And if you're aware of the situation there, Main Street is incredibly impacted today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A close up view of the site. And you can see we have fuel storage tanks across the street. That was a way of of reducing the project costs, making it simpler and making it easier to build. And it's also been incredibly productive in terms of the safety of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition, you see there the West Hornet Avenue Bikeway that's going to be put in by us. We're improving the street as well, as well as the park. All of our facility here is being raised to seven feet above sea level for sea level rise at the 50 year level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then finally, the SEALs issue that Nanette mentioned, and this is just a little project history on it, we first became aware of it roughly about a year ago, and we consulted with biologist at NOA and it NIPS the National Marine Fisheries Association.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was public comment, there was onsite meeting with the city staff and local residents in December. NOA issued its findings last month. And, you know, our intent is to build something for the SEALs. And as Nanette said, from our perspective, we submitted a memorandum memorandum of understanding, a draft about a month ago to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we understand the concern that we do not know enough about where this location is yet. But when we do, we are committed to funding and constructing that hall. So with that I can answer any questions or I can turn over next.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice mayor of two questions. You were here before. Who's responsible for spills and containment as you're being changing oil and fueling? We are. And is that in the contract part of the lease? Or how does how does that how does that get assigned?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's part of our regulatory responsibility with the Coast Guard. Coast Guard provides us licensing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. We're protective as a city. As far as liability from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. We have provisions in the lease that that make any spills the responsibility of the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the second is, you're still, according to the staff report, and what you said is you're still committed to building the hall out prior to dismantling the current one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. We are going to work with the city staff to identify the best location and timing for doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Prior to removing the existing one. That's. That's still your position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's that's that's our intent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just wanted to also clarify that in the lease, even before I knew that this the report of the the spill in the estuary was going to be on this agenda. I bookmark that there are pages in this in this lease agreement that we are approving tonight that have to do with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The installation use of fossil fuel storage facilities. They are required to be double walled Maersk and any fuel dock must contain adequate measures to prevent and detect any fuel spill spills or leaks. And it goes on, as I said, for pages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I thought it was very thorough. So I would just say that I want to be sure that no one who's listening gets confused with what's being presented here proposed tonight and the presentation we heard about the estuary spill, because after all, that's still a mystery.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, somebody we don't know where it came from, but it's clear that these sorts of procedures weren't in place. If you if you read this lease, as I said, riveting stuff. But it's it's very thorough. And see.'"

        "'speaker_6': 'But with regard to temporary measures, I wanted to I'm prepared to make a motion, but I wanted to just check in with the vice mayor. Was there a modification? You're talking about a modification of the language so this could come back for the second reading?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And was there language from what Mr. Mchunu stated that you wanted to have incorporated?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And before I answer that question there, and I was wondering if. We can have an explanation of the the next step of the process, because Mr. McConnell mentioned prior to a use permit being granted at the at the planning level that use permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In order to get that the noise issue is may be gated at that point. Is that correct? And the placement and maintenance responsibilities for the hall out may be placed at that at that point, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the two issues were the noise issues and the placement of all that. I was just getting it from my notes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I guess what we're trying to figure out here is how we can put the planning board and put conditions on the use permit here. I don't see any planners out here who can help us out. But we would hope that we could put some conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, we do conditions on developments all the time. But frankly, to answer that off the top of my head, I really can't give you a firm answer. That's certainly what we intend to do. And I appreciate this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will listen to the readers. We a staff, if they're willing to accept something like that. But, I mean, it's a matter of how we would design those conditions. So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm just going to address quickly. This project had Environmental Impact Report and an environmental impact statement that represents roughly 500 pages of analysis on issues such as noise. And if you're really curious about noise, those are the documents to reference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This isn't the first time this project has has been analyzed. It's been analyzed extensively in terms of those issues. Truck travel and truck paths to it are all documented in that document. And they follow the city code in terms of where those trucks are allowed to travel on your streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have laid that out very specifically about the streets that are allowed and not allowed. The trucks will go on this allowed streets. In terms of whether we're allowed to or whatever the arrangement is, we are more than happy to do an m0u to build a seal haul out money is not the issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are spending $50 million and so 80,000 is fine. You drive a hard bargain, but we will spend that 80,000. We provided an email you to the city and with the hopes that it can come to you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the city had had reservations about that moving forward. If those reservations could be overcome on the city level, we're happy to execute that. But really on our side, we were prepared to do it. If there's any other questions.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'No, I. This is something I was just going to make a comment about a come I heard from the dais about not wanting to hear any more cavalier attitude from staff about wildlife. And perhaps I missed it, but I'm actually quite impressed with all the discussions and negotiations and preparation of IMO use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's in process addressing the wildlife. So I, I don't think if anything, I think perhaps it was misinterpreted. I think we're taking this quite seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I do think that the comment made by one of the members of the public that. That stuff just kind of dismissed the idea that said, oh, they can just go to the break, the breakwater.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My point was, I kind of agreed with that, that member of the public that said that. So. I think my comment was I'm not taking it back, if that's what you're asking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, I know you're not. I'm not taking mine back either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe at this point we're waiting to hear from staff on. That's so right. So that everyone's aware at this point. We're waiting to hear back from staff in response to members questions.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Little.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Of respect for the public process. This, however, is a business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Meeting that needs to be conducted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like a business meeting. And Mr. Peterson, walking up to the proscenium and directing everybody how the meeting should proceed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is frankly inappropriate. The Clerk No. You directed all the way across here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not going to speak with Mr. Peterson. This is the point. This is the point. Madam Mayor, I'm sorry. You two get control of the chamber, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So this. I'm sorry. It's my understand. We're waiting to hear back from staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're trying to do that, but it's very difficult to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We thank you for your time for a five minute break.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we will be taking. Do we need a motion to do that? No. Okay. We will be taking a five minute break and reserving 10:00 for that clock. Thank you very much. Everyone, if you can, please take your seats.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to resume the meeting. Uh. Thank you very much. Appreciate your patience and staff. Will you be responding? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So in consultation with our potential partners that we'd have. The solution we've arrived.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At that we proposed to the Council is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have an memorandum of understanding in writing. That will be in the package for Thursday, this Thursday, and will be given to the Council to vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On at the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the second reading of this agreement. Therefore, if.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Council is not satisfied with the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Memorandum of Understanding at the time of the second reading, the Council then can vote down the second reading and you don't have a lease with WADA that you don't want. The first reading is tonight, but that doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Render the least effective, least effective upon the second reading. 30 days after. But the second reading is when you authorize it and then the 30 days happens, but you can't do is have the have the second vote and then undo it on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't want to go down that road. So our proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is. Either vote it up or down tonight. If you vote it up and it goes to a second reading.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then at the time of the second reading at the March 17th meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You will have an MRU in front of you that deals with the question of the hall layout putting money into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Escrow to pay for the hall out. All of those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Items would be in writing, and that's how we propose to solve the dilemma that we find ourselves in tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a follow up question to the attorney. Does that mean that this is not a substantive change?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct, because what you're voting on is the lease itself. And what you're adding on on the second read is basically a conditional document that we've already referenced that's been a promise which has given some trouble to certain of the council members that it's not a firm enough commitment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what we're suggesting is that staff, both of WETA and the city work very hard and get the actual document that you're looking for in place. So that Condition two going forward with the lease would actually be satisfied for you before you would do the second vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you're not modifying the actual ordinance of the lease approval, you just have the document in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you choose. If you don't like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Document, then you choose not to vote. The lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the the NYU language does not have to be contained in the original reading of the lease to still satisfy the public's right to notice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The well. The public will get the type of an M.O. you is required to come to the Council for an approval. And that's how we're setting this up. It will get its 12 day advance notice for council to take action.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what we're suggesting is that council will be able to look at that, decide if it's adequate to what you are looking for. What we're hearing from you here tonight, if you if you believe it is and you vote to approve that, then I assume you would be willing to go forward on the second reading, which is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'just confirming then the approval of the lease, because you have satisfied that your concerns, if instead the memo you that we bring forward does not do that, then you have the opportunity to just not do the second reading because you haven't had that issue satisfied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we're not building in the hall out issue into the lease itself, so we're not making any kind of substantial change to the lease itself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's clear. Any other member questions or comments?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just to be clear, that's mayor M.O.. You went. Should it be approved at the next council meeting will be a binding contract between Leda and the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is what our intent is, that it doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Need a second reading on its own.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, the MOTU does not. The reason we have a first and second reading for the lease is because again, our charter requires that we do leases pursuant to ordinance and so an ordinance requires two readings, an introduction and then an actual adoption.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The two readings but regular contracts, agreements, what have you only require one vote. And so the IMO you which is a separate document related but a separate document only requires one vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And, Madam Mayor, that satisfies my concerns. I, I want to see the jobs here. I want to see our marine related industry expanded. I want to protect the environment. Same time we had has mentioned and was in the staff report that they are of the same mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think I appreciate staff. I seen this of very intensely in the last 10 minutes. So I'm ready to move forward on the first reading and anticipate getting the ammo used so we can make sure that, you know, the public has a chance to look at it and we all are comfortable that it satisfies the concern'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Our second plus was that emotion. I thought we had emotion before, but it's just your emotion now, Vice Mayor, is that emotion that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We didn't have before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We didn't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So where are you planning to is that did you want to frame emotion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I confirm emotion around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's up to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You. I mean, your emotion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is here. The emotion is that we approved the first hearing of the lease as written. With the condition that a memorandum of understanding will accompany the second reading. And it will be reviewed and disposition at that time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In our second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Although some favorable comments. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to say to the members who are here tonight and to the watching public, I think this is exactly the example of staff really putting the grist to the wheel, so to speak, and making and working things out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The residents raise concerns and as proof, you know, we care about the environment and we care about moving forward with the economic development. So tonight, it's a good night. You know, everyone, we should feel happy about this. I support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And remember, it is all right. All those in favor I oppose. I oppose. The vote passes 4 to 1 and I oppose. First of all, I believe that this should have been included in the first reading. I'm not satisfied that a separate and we're coming back separately actually satisfies the intent of the law that in regards to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the first reading and the second reading. And then also I have the concerns that were stated that I in regards to an environmental review on this issue, having experts brought in, it's not just putting up some floating dock that there's actually a special specialist that spending time analyzing this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm concerned about the noise, the hours of operation. And I think that there should also be simulation sharing that with the community. And I, I think it's actually very important that the size of the building itself, as well as all of the additional docks, be clearly shown and depicted in a manner that's clear to the public before'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we proceed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Chair, may I ask a question of staff?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's usually not appropriate, but I'm not sure what you're going to be asking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This question is on the process of the use permit and the planning process for actually building what the lease now and what the lease will have will include public input and planning board decision on the size, shape and scope of the building and will deal with issues of noise and put mitigations and additional restraints on if demonstrated'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there needed will allow the public to weigh in. So there's a whole process in front of this. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, you are correct. They still assuming the lease is approved finally and it is effective, then we will have to go through our process of the design review and getting approvals from the planning board, which is all public process and all of the things that you mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Vice Mayor Matarese would be part of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if the Planning Board's decision doesn't satisfy one member of this body, that member within ten days of the decision can call it for review. Is that also correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think there's a it's not trust us, it's subject to scrutiny by the council, subject to scrutiny by the planning board, and it's subject to scrutiny by the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So actually, I think comments like that need to be made prior to the vote. So moving on to item six be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Introduction of ordinance amending Alameda Municipal Code Chapter 19, Section 19 for underground utility districts to approve the redesigned underground utility district policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Steiger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer and members of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Elmira City Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Glenn Steiger. I'm general manager of Alameda Municipal Power. And we're before you here tonight to introduce the redesigned Underground Utility District Program, which has been in place since 1984, but which was suspended in 2012 for the express purpose of redesign based on certain concerns that were raised at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that introduction, I'd like to turn this presentation over to our Assistant General Manager of Engineering Operations, Doug Drager, who will walk you through the redesign program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Drager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, General Manager Steiger. Mayor Spencer, members of the council, appreciate your time tonight. I want to run through a short presentation, introduce you to the background of the U. D program. Talk about the proposed changes, as Mr. Steiger indicated in the redraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I talk about quickly about some next steps, and of course, to answer any questions. The first thing I do want to do is publicly thank members of the public who served on our stakeholder committees throughout the entire process, some of which are here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd also like to thank Lori Cusick of Public Works, who is my liaison with Public Works and was a great assistance. Also my peers, Robert or Veda and Rebecca Irwin and Gary Spirit, who helped develop this program. And then, of course, Bob Hein and Mr. Steiger, the department heads of public works and and AMP, respectively, who acted'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as the sponsors for this program. As General Manager Steiger mentioned, this program began in 1984. It was a beautification program for the city. Ordinance was written to convert through underground districts that were decided by designated by the city council to convert from overhead to underground facilities that involved all overhead facilities, those regulated by the CPC as well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as AMP, which is regulated by our Public Utilities Board and ultimately by the council. A fund was set up to collect 2% of the AMP electric revenue and that fund was set up exclusively as a reserve to fund this undergrounding program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To date, about 50% of the island is underground. That's a combination of underground that was installed as underground and new developments as the electrical system was built up. We also have completed 25 yards to date, which accounts to about 433 customers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In about 2011, when we started working on District 31, which is the Webster Crossing, we really reached a consensus with our public and staff that there was existing problems with the current process that had not really had any kind of major changes since 1984.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the biggest concerns was district prioritization. There really wasn't a process in place for understanding why one district got funded over another. The public and staff had considerable concerns over the public participation, and then there was a substantial interest in the cost of conversion for property owners, especially during the time we were just coming out of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a recession. And actually a lot of people weren't even out of the recession by that point in time. So staff made a recommendation and council accepted that in 2012 we would redraft the program in order to reflect some of the conditions and concerns that the public and the staff had.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are four main considerations that we that we wanted to address. The first was the prioritization. At the time, there were 16 different criteria that denoted the prioritization of of you. Some of them didn't even have an objective ness to them at all, and there really was no historical backing as to where they came from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So so we needed to really focus on how how districts were prioritized and chosen. We also wanted to take a look at not only the including the public in the process of the redrafting of the program, but then how the public would play a part in in implementing the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also wanted to take a look at the financial obligations as to what kind of cost sharing fit with with the modern times and then implementation in understanding the different city roles. It really breaks it down into three parts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The policy is what's in front of you tonight that's reflected in the ordinance. The master plan and the and the scorecard are two of the of the behind the scenes or the implementation tools of the process and would be things that would would be would change over time as as eventualities came up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the policy would be something that's it's an overarching guidance. It would have city approval. It obviously is memorialized in it and in a ordinance. And we want to come back and review it every five years. And that's an improvement from the old process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want to at least take a look at it every five years. So let's take a look at the program from from kind of a 30,000 foot level and go through the each of the each of the steps.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It starts with the district nominating board. The intent of the district nominating board is to involve the public with with city members to really denote to taking a look at the overall map of of where you these could be positioned within the city work with applying the criteria that that have been introduced.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'll go over I'll touch on a little bit in more detail, apply those criteria to the different parts of the island in order to get a some kind of recommendation for areas where you Udi's would would best fit and would rise to the top of the prioritization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in doing so each, each of the foods in order to fulfill the program for general public interest and benefit. And the counterpart is rule 28. If you've heard about it on the CPU side or the regulated side, each of the foods would have to meet one of the three criteria listed there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason for that is, is under the CPC Rule 20, a, any CPC regulated utility such as AT&T or Comcast would need to have one of these criteria present in the UD in order to be able to participate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, they could participate, however, they get funding for it, so they would need that. Otherwise they're not going to cough up their own money for it. We wanted to address that to other you. You did the two other underground situations within the policy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, they haven't fit within the program in the past and that is of general public interest, but primarily of local benefit. These would be you, you, these are underground districts that don't meet any of the CPC criteria. And so they wouldn't be in the general public, they would would be in the general public interest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would want them underground, but it would be primarily for a local benefit, such as a developer who wanted to underground. This could still be incorporated into the program. However, the fees and costs would be paid by the developer, by those citizens who wanted to do that, and then areas of insufficient general or local public benefit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It fits with Rule 20 C on the CPC side, those who continue, they would sit outside the program and they would continue to be funded by the private party. Who benefited from that? So the CPAC criteria this came this was derived out of a series of stakeholder meetings with the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was actually a public stakeholders who put together these criteria. They also found that they wanted them. Oops, sorry, it's not on the slide. They wanted them waited. So the tier ones would we have with the scorecard that I alluded to earlier, it would provide an objective score around the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The tier ones would obviously be weighted a little bit more heavily. Their tier twos would be weighted down from that. This would allow a prioritization, an objective prioritization that would give us a sense for what what you would rise to a higher level than others.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's it's information and allows us to prioritize them. The program is generally wants we generally are the stakeholders generally wanted to favor island entryways and heavily traveled road. The reason for this is the reasoning is is that that would derive the most general public benefit for the citizens of Alameda that they contribute to this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second is a holdover from the old program is the Technical Advisory Committee. Back in the day that was headed by public works in about 1990, AMP took over the leadership in the in the nineties, AMP took over the leadership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'AMP would continue to be the project leader. This is the step where we really define the exact boundaries of of the recommended UDS that come from the DMB. So we would want to the TAC would want to find what between one and four UDS that rise to the highest level on the criteria define the define the exact'",
        "'speaker_3': 'boundaries so that everyone the public knows specifically the UDS that we're discussing because the next step of that is to take it to a town hall meeting. The town hall meeting is to expose the citizens within those districts that are being considered as well as anyone who has any other interest of exactly what the boundaries are going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to be and any issues and conditions relevant to to the UD process. That's followed up by a district selection survey, and that serves two purposes. The first is to catch anybody who didn't come to the town hall meeting, who might be in one of the UDS and in provides them with the same information and the same Q&A'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that they happened at the town hall meeting will be dispensed with the district selection survey. The second is to gauge interest from those people who are in the foods, to give us to give us to ultimately be able to make a recommendation to you council on some kind of basis of feedback for how they feel about the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'issues or recommendations or the issues about you you do, and the boundaries, etc..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, before you continue. Our protocol requires that by 1030 that we'll need four votes to consider remaining items. We still have item 60, 66 E and nine A and it's 1030, approximately 1030. The Council would do. Want to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there so much do you think, that you want to go forward with all of these items tonight and you want to have any items that we don't necessarily have to go forward with tonight? And the comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Still.'",
        "'speaker_0': '60, 60, 69. Oh, yes. And then go back to closed session after. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor, I will ask if I can or my council referral. To a future agenda. This is going to be late, late, late. I want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I appreciate that, vice mayor. Are there any other of these agenda items that we don't necessarily need to proceed with at this point? Staff. Just cause we have feedback from you or any council members.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think with the vice mayor's gracious accommodation, I would move that. We go past that we consider additional items after 1030.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to start a response, if there are any, that they don't think we need to proceed with this evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we don't need to correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It could come down that I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would potentially look at is succeed, but I would defer that to Mr. Nguyen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would just also want to make sure that we're not then overloading another agenda because we, you know, want to keep doing this to ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, actually, we don't all keep doing this to ourselves. I don't prepare the agenda. Or as I know, you don't prepare the agenda. This gets handled. This gets brought to us. Yeah. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We could defer six C or just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Delay or smarter parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Meters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we think that one would even take that much time?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I prefer. Just keep it. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So we have a motion on the table. Second, all those in favor. I propose I oppose the votes 4 to 1 to pass. I oppose because I think it's inappropriate, as we had an earlier speaker this evening, say that we're not really public when we're having such late meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we're going to have an agenda building problem. So you may continue. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. The next step of the process is after receiving the district selection survey. Feedback is for the TAC to bring between one and three yard recommendations to City Council for approval. City Council then at that point will make a determination and and ultimately by resolution, put the districts, choose the districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At that point, a single master contractor will be used to coordinate and install all the electrical sub panels and do and do all the work. Again, that was another recommendation that came from from our stakeholder process. In light of the cost sharing program for areas of general public interest in benefit, which has been this program since 1984'",
        "'speaker_3': ', the general master contractor. And the intent of the program is to cover underground laterals from back of sidewalk. Obviously the distribution in the street, but the back of sidewalk to people's meter meter on their property. The conversion of the panel is also included in the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is not included is if a resident decides that at that point in time they want to convert to a larger panel, such as going from 100 AMP panel to a 200 AMP panel, the duty fund would not fund that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also, telecommunications under the CPC ruling will pay for the first 100 feet in Alameda. That applies for almost every service that's out there. Most customers will not have an out-of-pocket expense in the conversion. That's the intent of the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, there and when I say most, I mean we're hoping 99.9%. There's probably two different situations where people may have costs. They may choose to have a path from the service point, a back, a sidewalk to some point on their house.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That AMP does not agree to and believes that it's an excess above, above and beyond. I think what would be normal and agreed upon and we don't believe that the fund or the rest of the customers should pay for that, for that excess.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we do find that we understand that not all paths will be an exact straight line if people have encumbrances in their yards. We can work that out. And that's why the policy does allow for AMP to approve any anything that's that's out of the ordinary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, if things are extremely out of the ordinary, we believe that customers should pick up that extreme expense. Also, there will be a few services that might be over 100 feet in which they will have some cost to the telecom company, although we anticipate it to be very, very small.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And will it really be a case by case basis? Again, as I mentioned, four areas of general public interest, but they do not meet a CPC criterion in public benefit. Those would be funded 100% by the applicant or applicants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We ask only a few things from from business owners and their responsibility. We do want them to be involved in the process. We do want them to come to the town hall meeting. We do want them to provide survey responses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Although we do have a master contractor, we understand that some people want to hire their own and we want to allow that. However, the reimbursement costs will be based on on a determined square foot costs so that, again, the fund or everyone's general money isn't paying for someone's excessive costs for what they want to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So as long as they stay within that standard rate is determined by the master contractor, the fund will reimburse them for those costs to cost share as appropriate. There was some concern that came out of the process in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The resident owns their underground service from the point of service, which is behind the sidewalk to the meter panel. There was concern by some residents that they didn't want to take on that risk of having an underground service.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So AMP will set up a maintenance fund. It'll be funded through a monthly contribution by those who choose to be involved in it. It will be very small. The amount would be very small. And if there is an act, if their service does fail for any reason other than third party malice, basically a third party digging into'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it if if it fails for any other reason ample come out and and it will be repaired under the maintenance costs. So it takes away that risk. So in summary, the redesign really captures, I think, the the design of what we wanted to capture it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do have what we believe to be a fairly solid objective scorecard. We will be if if you do approve the policy, we'll be working with stakeholder groups to make the last final additions to that and making sure that it's a very solid, objective scorecard for prioritizing districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's a much more transparent process because it's quantifiable scorecard. It's and we also are going to do it in the public arena. We have every intent to publish everything that we do within the stakeholder meetings. And then ultimately as the DMB and the TAC move along, we plan to publish all of that as well on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the UDD website and we believe that we have a better process for gathering public input than we had before and that the plan proposes, promotes or creates a maintenance fund. This was presented at a town hall meeting back in late November, in November and in it passed it was a robust meeting was held a robust meeting with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a lot of questions and the policy that's before you with just some very minor tweaks by the PCB and December eight policy. That's before you was robustly supported by everyone at the town hall meeting back in November. Next steps, disregard the revise the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can consider this the first reading of the ordinance unless unless there's other direction we would if the policy is approved tonight, we would AMP would need to revise their rules and regulations that are based on the on the old program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we are already in the process of program initiation and gathering the team, but we would want to put that in high gear. The intent is to try and get the D and B together by early summer, no later than August.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Try to get you dudes in front of you, hopefully before the Christmas break or not soon after so that we can get going on the master contractor. That RFP is going to take some work, but we want to get that done because hopefully we can get a shovel in the ground in late spring or maybe early summer'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of next year. With that, I'm all yours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any clarifying questions?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've got my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, ASHCROFT.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. And thank you for that presentation. And by the way, for all of you who put it together, that was a really great staff report, really interesting to read. I think this is a great project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my only question, by the way, there was no shortage of acronyms in that presentation, although I think I followed most of them. But so the D and B is the district nomination board, and I'm looking at exhibit one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm on page three, and it talks about how the district nomination board A, D and B is responsible for the initial nomination of proposed districts. I mean, you've done a great job on public outreach already with these town halls and, you know, hearing from from stakeholders.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it wasn't clear to me from reading this material how will you notify the public and solicit public interest in serving on the DMB? Because I would imagine you want see geographical representation around the city or whatever your criteria are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So how will people who might be, who might be interested, who haven't stayed up till 1042 listen to this presentation. I know about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our intent is to publish it as widely as possible. So the ULI program and all supporting documents are on the UDD site at Alameda Municipal Power. We have a quite a public. Stakeholder group that is that has an email that set up in our email blast.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that information around where we are in the process and what's coming up would be sent out on that. And we would also be partnering with with the City Hall and publication around.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city website. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what about local publications like print publications?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. Our intent our intent is to publish it to garner as much support as possible. We're hoping to have to ask people to wait until the next one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. If they've already served. Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do have a speaker on this of clarifying questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Member Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you met a mayor back on this, this DMB, the three people. How are they all one. How are they going to be selected? I mean, is that something AMP selects or the council selects or the mayor appoints?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And two are what are the qualifications to serve on this board?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The qualifications is that you need to be a customer of of amp that can be both a landowner or an actual meter a meter customer. Beyond that, we're not restricting it. The selection process is we haven't we haven't 100% written it out, but it would be something where we would solicit interest and and in some kind of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'application, it wouldn't be too involved. How we would go about ultimately deciding what what person it may be, again, bringing together a stakeholder group. We don't want to put a lot of restrictions because we want everyone, but we will have to limit it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Otherwise it becomes an unwieldy committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then let's take our public speaker, Travis Wilson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again. I've been through this for the last four years and I wanted to come and I wanted to say that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I like this policy and I think that you should pass it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the process has worked out pretty well. And I know you have a lot of people who want to be underground, and I think this is the best policy you're going to get. And Doug is the dedicated guy, and he has really brought a lot of this stuff into this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that although there are not details like that, I think that they're going to develop in the in this structure. And I think it's really kind of well put together. And I want to use the rest of my time to tell you a little story.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Four years ago, I was sitting with a bunch of other people in District 31 and some of you remember this. That was our it was our I was I was one of those guys. It was our questions and and confusion and dissatisfaction that inspired me to redo this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We really believed that the majority of our district would want to to be exempt from undergrounding. We really thought that most people didn't want to do it in our particular district, but we didn't know if that mattered. We didn't know if we could change our fate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we we tried to ask and we couldn't find out. And we read city ordinances. The language is actually the ordinance itself is actually pretty similar to what you see in this new plan. A lot of questions have been answered in this new plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm hitting the one that hasn't if you haven't seen where I'm going with that, you know, we knew the city could require undergrounding in certain cases, but we didn't know if those cases applied to us. And we just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Asked, can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our district opt out? Can we say as a group we're going to opt out? No straight answer, no. No documentation, nothing written. We could consult. So the plan gets an overhaul. A couple of years later, I go to the the stakeholder meeting that Doug mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was I was one of those. I asked again, can a district opt out? It was not something that made it into the criteria. So, again, no, no information. And I go to pub a few months ago when this policy has come in and I ask him, I was that guy again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I asked him, you know what? What if this plan is better? But some people are surly. And what if you get a group of of a district where the residents don't want to dig? And they were very accommodating and they took it very seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they got lawyers involved. And. Like Doug has written in your packet, the lawyer said that there would be too many legal issues involved with measuring residents opinion, and so they they too many legal issues involved in acting on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so they weren't going to do it. Which, by the way. Side note, that's a hell of a thing to say. I think it's legally complicated to ask the residents what they want. So. So we're not going to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope that we have better public input channels than that. And and that they reach more people than those who could show up to the town hall. Hopefully there's a middle ground some way we can measure the opinion of a group of people and take it seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's not my point. And it's not AMP's job to deal with that. And tonight, my request is, please change that. Please be clear. Talk among yourselves. But say something. Please be clear whether a district that doesn't want to be underground did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And whether they have a recourse to be exempt. They can follow the due process. But but, you know, we ask and everyone says if it happens, we'll ask council. And it happened four years ago and it came to council and we redid the whole plan, but we still don't have an answer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And because this is designed to speed up the process, I'm saying maybe you could get something on the record tonight that people can use to know whether they can decide as a district to opt out or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Otherwise, I really. There's been tremendous progress here. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And we have we do have another speaker now, Rosalinda Fortuna, Kaveh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. I'll be quick. I'm a property owner close to Webster Street. And I was concerned with. The neighborhood. It's very close. Webster Street is very close to single family homes. A lot of these owners cannot. Hey, for, you know, all these improvements that they have to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I don't see how in I don't know how the telecommunications companies will pay for the first 100 feet, which is. Very expensive to do because I've done sewer laterals and I know how expensive those are. So it's pretty similar to doing a sewer lateral from what I see, because the majority of a sewer lateral expense is'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the labor in digging up the soil. And that's why now we have the sewers being done without digging it up. And you have other ways of replacing sewers because it's just way too expensive.

So today we are recommending the purchase and installation of about 822 smart parking meters in the city of Alameda. This really got rolling back in June of 2014 when the city council authorized a three month pilot from October through'",
        "'speaker_3': 'December of these single spaced, credit card enabled smart parking meters. So the key oh, actually, before even before the ball got rolling here, we had lots of outreach in early 2014 to the public, to the West Alameda Business Association and to the Park Street Business Association, asking what their needs were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the use of a credit card came up as a big need in the community, as well as we wanted to find out from folks their preference of a single space meter versus a kiosk. And there was a very clear result in that outreach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We did a survey of 800 plus Olympians, and the result was a strong preference for the single spaced meters and against the kiosks. So the single spaced meters, some of their features are of a large LED screen that's interactive and customizable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You can use both a credit card and also coins. And if you look on the bottom right there, there's a solar panel. So there's both solar power, plus a back backup battery. And if you look at the green light below the solar panel, that green light shows that there's a time that's been purchased.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is important for Alameda police because traffic enforcement are going back. They can see that clear green light or it's red if there's no time that's been purchased. So this is a big benefit from the enforcement perspective just to be able to see, see clearly whether the meter is on or off.'",

We convened the departments, including Alameda Police, in order to get their input on the process as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now I can share some of the results of that tonight. I'll come out and or in a in a slider to I'll talk a little bit more about the public input. But a good place to start is literally with the transactions.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'One is, with the more time you're purchasing, you probably don't have coins to cover all of that. So you're going to use a credit card. And the second reason is credit card users are probably a little more likely like myself.'",

When we did a public survey to find satisfaction with the smart meters, we received 104 survey responses.'",
        "'speaker_3': '72% of them of their responses showed clear satisfaction with the meters. But that actually understates the satisfaction with the meters. And here's why. The light blue in that pie chart, the other 28%. A good portion of that light blue were folks who were telling us that they weren't satisfied with the height of the meters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're going to talk about that challenge in just a moment. Not about the smart meters themselves. They were supportive of the smart meters. Just wanted to fix the height problem. The other reason that this slide understates the case for the meters is a fair amount of the light.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Blue represents folks who were complaining about the kiosks and they were taking the opportunity of this survey to voice their displeasure about the kiosks. So again, that's all to say that it's probably around 85 to 90% satisfaction with with the smart, smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's talk about height. One of the really fun parts about this project was to solicit this public input and get something that I frankly had not thought about, which is because of the nature of the screens they're angled.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're five foot five or under, it's hard to see that screen. And so what we are going to do is in the current pilot areas, we are going to cut the meter poles to make sure that that LED screen is between 42 and 48 inches.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When we learned about this problem, we immediately reached out to some of our partner cities who have installed similar meters and found out that this was the best practice. We're going to make sure that for our meetings in this height range that this actually works for them.'",

We're only purchasing 822. We were able to get those same Sacramento prices, but in Alameda with a lower volume, we probably saved in the range of $50 per meter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And with that, you've got our recommendation to both purchase and install 822 smart parking meters. And I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone have any clarifying questions? Remember, they.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Suck. Now, I believe, like in Walnut Creek when I use that, I think. I don't think it takes Discover Card. Are we just limited to MasterCard and Visa?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Liz, the court is going to correct me in a moment, but I believe right now it's MasterCard and Visa and we can elect to bring in American Express. And I'm not sure about Discover Card. Yes, we can bring in discover.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cards that we can elect. We would elect to do that. Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other clarifying questions? Do we have we don't have any speakers, I believe, on this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, we have one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But you're still going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Rob Rado. I'm glad I asked for speakers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. Rob Reiner, executive director of the Pass Through Business Association. And I'm sure this is going to come as a big surprise to you that I am here this evening to emphatically endorse the 822 smart parking meters, not only for Park Street, but for the entire city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Leon was a little dainty in his explanation of. What happened when the previous council raised the parking rate we got in the first week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We got lots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And lots of complaints about the rate. From then on to today, we get complaints about, oh my God, we got to bring 3 of quarters with us to get 2 hours of parking. So that was that's been a huge problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've had these in for a number of months. And I'll tell you, the folks I've talked to who are members, every last one I've talked to wants this. And how I know that the members that I haven't talked to want this because they haven't emailed me, called me, or come to a mixer and complained about the smart'",
        "'speaker_2': 'meters. And most of you know my membership, and if they have not complained, then they don't have a complaint. I believe there were a number of years ago when we did streetscape phase two, Pittsburgh backed. The chaos at the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will tell you why. Because at the time, that was the best. Technology available. These were not available then. Unfortunately, the kiosks have proved to be problematic. They have some maintenance issues, not a lot. But when a kiosk goes down, unlike when a meter goes down and you can just screw another head on it, a kiosk'",
        "'speaker_2': 'goes down and you're walking, you know, halfway down the block you're walking across to get the little you know, the little slip. And frankly, it proved that a lot of folks don't like the little slips. Sorry, we tried, but this technology is absolutely what we believe is going to work, not only for Park Street, but for Alameda'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So, of course, we are urging you to vote and let's get this stuff done as quickly as possible. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We have another speaker first, Linda Fortuna.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to comment that when I was traveling in Riga, Latvia, about three, maybe four years ago, they have a really good, smart meter. They have it so that you can take your cell phone, pay your parking bill on your cell phone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's it's all it's easy. And you can download an app. Or is that? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead. Remember, Audie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So as excited as you can be about something at 1120, this is I remember they excited about this and this is little anecdotal, but I had a meeting with with Doug Biggs the other day and we had to end early because I ran out of of and it never changed to to have a long enough meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you know, West Cafe's a really good place. I'd like to sit there a little longer sometimes. And then this afternoon I was in Oakland, but my 45 minutes in and didn't have to worry. And actually, you know, the city got extra money out of me because I was done in 15 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to the to the public comment that park mobile I'd like to see us consider that park mobile it's it's really convenient they have it in Oakland you punch in your zone know you can renew it. I don't know if we want to do that, but you can renew it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, if you only put a half hour in and you end up staying an hour, you can renew it on your phone to 30% charge extra and truly convenient. And, you know, I'm excited to see this technology come to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. So in the survey of the public, it was very clear that using the credit card that was folks is number one priority and then it's down the list from there. But paying by phone would be another. We're hopeful that in June or July, when we come back to report on the results of the parking meter study'",
        "'speaker_3': ', that one of the recommendations we're going to make at that point is an option for paying by cell phone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is this are we doing this all at the same time, or is Webster Street going to get some smart meters before the rest of Park Street or what's the rollout schedule look?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the pilot is on both. So the pilot is on. It's already one block of Webster, one block of Park. The big task in front of us is to figure out this meter height challenge. We're going to do that within the pilot areas and then we'll try to roll them out across the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After tackling that challenge within, you know, it'll probably take four weeks to do the whole city, I'd imagine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other member member ASHCROFT.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So if I understand correctly, the option of paying by cell phone could be considered, could be added, because I will also throw in I haven't been to Latvia, but in British Columbia, Canada, and probably ten years ago I was visiting and I thought it was really cool that the relatives I was with, we were at'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a restaurant and could go, Oh, we got to add money to the meter and I was ready to run out and it just whipped out the cell phone. Would it cost more to add that feature?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It depends. So the short answer is most cities choose to put the what they call convenience fee on the user. So I believe in San Francisco it's around $0.45 or the city can elect to essentially absorb that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I wasn't saying I wasn't offering that. You know what I mean is would the meters themselves, themselves cost more if they also had the smartphone capability?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Probably not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Probably not. So I just think more options are better than less. And especially I mean, it's one thing if you're just one person going back and forth, sometimes you're a parent with little kids or, you know, someone who's elderly who might not want to have to hassle back because they realize they didn't put enough time in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would strongly, even if the survey doesn't show that, I think some people might just might not have experienced that feature. But I have to think you'd love it once you try it. Let's keep that in mind, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have a question in regards to that. If it's a two hour parking space, can you add time via your phone to go beyond 2 hours?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. You can build in restrictions so that it maxes out of that 2 hours. You cannot add beyond that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Do we have a motion?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I met a mayor. I'd like to move stats recommendation and include the comments regarding use of cell phone and discover card.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, American Express as well, if you can take a look at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a second. All those. Any comments? All those in favor, I suppose. Motion passes unanimously. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next item six D.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The recommendation to adopt plans and specification and authorize call for bids for fire station number three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Evening, Madam Mayor. Member of the City Council. Bob Hahn, Public Works Director. The item before you tonight is a recommendation to adopt plans and specifications and authorize call for bid for fire station number three located on Wayne, a vista adjacent to Herbert Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is really a 15 year project. If you remember in the year 2000 is when the existing fire station number three was declared uninhabitable and seismically unsafe. And since that time, the firefighters on station three have been renting a house next door and living in that house.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city's female hazard mitigation plan has identified the replacement of fire station number three and the EOC as a critical item. This process started in 2012 with in the fall of 2012, with three meetings, community meetings around the site, and followed by another meeting in July of 13.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was an outreach to all the community around the station and quite a discussion. And these meetings were well-attended. On October 15th, we executed the contract for the EOC. The EOC was bid a short time later in the fall, and we had a bid protest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the reasons we were bidding in the fall was to kind of get ahead. It was the September bid. We could get a foundation in the ground, start the EOC. The EOC was fully funded as opposed to the fire station at that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the decision was move was made to move ahead with the EOC. Even the bid protest was was basically an issue regarding subcontractor licenses being listed on one of the forms. One of the contractors threw up a protest on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By the time we resolved that protest and would have gone back out to bid, we would have been right back in the middle of the winter again here and precluding us from getting a foundation in the ground. So at that point in time, the decision was made to combine the two projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason for combining the projects were is that cost savings and some of the cost savings would be we would only have to do one mobilization. Contractors typically charge anywhere from 50 to $100000 for what they call mobilization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bringing a trailer out there, phone lines in battle lines, erecting the temporary fence and things like this. By combining the two projects, we eliminated that need for to pay for two fencing, two trailers and stuff like that. Because there was always a possibility we would end up with two separate contractors with each one of the structures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We only have one contractor now for the entire site. We don't have any finger pointing back and forth between contractors, the contractor contractors, not blaming it on the fire station contractor. And so we have a much cleaner project in that respect, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're gaining an economy of scale where you have a larger project, more materials, and therefore there should be a significant cost savings on that regard to. It's a coordinated project. We have one contractor now, so everything is coordinated between the two structures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is interaction between the two structures in the event of an emergency that they actually act in concert. The fire station is kind of the public face of the of the complex where the piano would be located, the volunteers would be dealt with at the fire station site, and the EOC site would be separate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And lastly, we would have more competition with a higher number. Generally a contractor like Arma Rosso that are that are built our library across the street, they usually have a de minimis amount of $10,000. They did give us a bid on the EOC kind of as a favor to me, but this certainly made it more attractive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of the three contractors were pre qualified. These are essential structures. These structures are designed not to fall down in a 7.0 on the Hayward fault. There's a lot of rules and regulations and criterias and certifications involved in the construction of these contract, these structures.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And all three of these contractors have put up a number of these structures. So we're very confident in this particular group. If you look in your staff report regarding the the closeness of the bid on the EOC, that really shows it speaks well of the architect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The numbers were relatively close for this type of work. And so the architect of that just indicates the architectural plans were very tight and everybody came up with the same number, more or less. So I am recommending that we move forward on the plans and specs and build the fire station and the EOC together here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just as an aside, we are working with the city of Napa in the construction of their new wells EOC, because both the city's EOC up at Napa and the county EOC up at Napa both failed in the event of that recent earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they were both in in interested in constructing a separate EOC at this time. I'm available for questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you have any clarifying questions at this time? And we do have three speakers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One when madumere one clarifying question I have is the estimated debt service is not to exceed $300,000 annually. So that's principal and interest. That's the debt service, $300,000 annually. But in total, over a 20 year period in total, the debt service, principal and interest when we repay all back will equal $6.9 million over 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But when I when I add $300,000 a year over 20 years, I get $6 million, not 6.9 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm going to turn this over to our interim finance director. Forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everyone. Good evening. I'm Julian Boyer and I have served as the interim finance director and I have come back to answer questions on this financing since I've been working on it. You're probably correct that the total debt service, which includes principal and interest, is the greater amount.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, you know what actually it means? Julian Boyer, the city mayor, just actually did the math for me when I was looking at $300,000. I was looking at it. Not take into account their $50,000 annual savings. That because when you add up the $350,000 over 20 years, that comes out to be $7 million, which is roughly 6.9'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Okay, I'm satisfied. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It. It was a great job.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Happy? I could answer your question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, Audie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This may be the last time we hear from you for a while. So I do want to thank you again for your your service.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clarifying questions. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I am. This is something that I actually raised in an email and thank you for answering me during the afternoon. But and I thought member de SAC was going to touch on it. But when somewhere in here there is a table that says the total amount.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's probably the other staff report says that the total cost of the the fire station it is it's exhibit three the staff report from July of 2014. And it and it talks about the different funds that are being put into the construction of the the fire station three, which I support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it says total cost of fire station three is $5 million. But then as we go down into the financial impact paragraph, it's well laid out, but what all the financing costs were. So that was my email. The question was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what is the total cost of fire station three, really? And I likened it to if you buy a car on and you take an auto loan out, you would have on because it's required by state law the amount of principal you're paying and the amount of interest and what the total amount of your purchase is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the same if you have a mortgage on your home. Only it's even more startling. So just for the sake of, you know, the public information and the councils is well, if there is a way that we could call the total amount, the total amount, because after all, it is what the city is going to be paying'",
        "'speaker_6': 'over time. But I do also want to echo Councilmember Odie and thank you for your service and patiently explaining all these things to us at these really ridiculous hours. And we do appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. I watched and I took a nap. So you're right in that the principal amount is $5 million. That's what it cost to construct the building. However, what does it cost to finance that $5 million over approximately 20 years?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have a lot of internal funds and we had proposed a 3% interest rate on those internal funds. Some of it is cash from the sale of the existing fire station. When everyone's moved out and it's abandoned, then the sale of that was included in that list of funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's included with the equipment replacement equipment replacement fund and sale of the property. At 1703, Grande Street is estimated at about $425,000. So that's a part of it. So that doesn't have any interest attached to it, but it comes at the very end of the project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What what I have been able to determine is that the. 2013. Excuse me. Let me back up a minute. Those funding sources for the fire station are mostly internal, so the interest rate is about 3%, which is about 50 to $82000 a year in debt service, 1.6 million.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The eye bank loan of 3 million is yet to be determined, but we believe that we have a locked interest rate of about 2.95%, much lower than had been predicted in July.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Yeah. And numbers went down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So the question at this point is, has to do with the term how well along that loan would be. And it probably will be about 18 or 19 years rather than 20. But the debt service on that is about $217,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we're looking at that in the neighborhood of 3 to 400000, 33, 50 a year in debt service. We'll have it pinned down as we get to negotiating with the bank and get the details really finalized on that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we we have a cap of $3 million that the council previously approved for the financing. So we're working within that. We've also identified some unspent bond funds from the redevelopment agency that we are looking at the possibility of using.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we do that, that will relieve some of those internal loans and we won't have to pay interest on the internal loan funds, but we will be looking at the repayment of the unspent bond funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that sounds better still.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you clarify when you said a cap that's on the principle of the loan? Pardon me? The cap of 3 million? Yes. On the principle of the loan? That's correct. The total cost. The total back. The loan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And the total cost that you're estimating is 6.9 million over 20 years of what the city will be responsible for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this doesn't say in here, but would this money be coming from where the general.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That this would be encroaching upon the general fund? Yes. So out of. Do you know where it would be coming from? More specifically, what we would be taking it away from?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, taking it away from. I'm not sure that that's how I would phrase it, but it is an additional expense added to the existing $75 million or whatever the budget number is in that particular year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So are you suggesting we have extra money annually in our general fund that would go towards us, that we it would not impact any other appropriations that are currently made?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know the answer to that question yet. The budget has to be developed and this would be accommodated within the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Could you repeat your answer? There was. There's chatter. I couldn't hear you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the the debt service would be a part of the budgeting process and would be accommodated within the within the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other clarifying questions? All right. I'm going to go ahead and call the speakers. The first one, Neill Flicker, and then Gerry. And you holler. And then Gretchen LeBeau.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's late.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Neal Pflueger.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A 25 year resident of of Alameda. I am a CERT member. But my my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Main interest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In being here tonight comes from from my 20 years experience with Alameda County Office of Emergency Services as a volunteer. And I'm glad we've gotten.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's. In my humble opinion, overdue. Thank you. Let's let's move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. My name is Jerry Jala. I'm a member of the Alameda Executive Committee for those new on the council, surf stands for Community Emergency Response Team or Volunteer Group under the Alameda Fire Department's Disaster Preparedness Office. Over the last 15 years, we've had over 1200 people trained by the fire department in personnel and disaster response.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the functions of the executive committee is to provide ongoing training and exercises to keep everybody skills up to date and sharp. And the new EOC will help accommodate that going into the future. Thank you for your support of this event.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do have one question. Have you taken into account the cost savings of not having to rent the building next to Fire Station three in the future? Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The bill. I think she may have left. It's a 20 to 12. So no other speakers. My understanding. Remember? Comments, questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And America.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the existing fire station is inadequate. And we've been renting a house in before that, a trailer. So this part of the of the proposal, I think, makes sense, especially with the comments made by our public works director.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't see how we can't delay this. And the opportunity is now as we put more jobs and put a new facility out at and made a point of we're going to need the coverage. So I'm supportive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions? Comments. Number Day.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. You know, I've supported this proposal when it was a stand alone AOC and I continue to support this when it's combined with a fire station. I think it's important that we move forward, especially with the new EOC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And clearly, the fire station on Grand Street, we all know it's inadequate. You know, it's going to cost money. You know, money doesn't grow on trees. We all know that. And it's going to come from the general fund to repay the amount.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, but these are tough decisions that we have to make. And I and I know one thing, not having an up to date emergency operating center and not having the best modern fire station that we can have centrally located in town, I mean, there's certainly a ticking time bomb cost there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have to factor that in. So I'm going to move I'm going to certainly support this action night.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Ashcroft and I would echo the two prior my two prior colleagues on that. This is a it's a as was noted, a very centrally located on the island fire station. And it's a quaint little house, but it certainly doesn't even accommodate the size equipment that we have now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And yet this is a very important station that will will serve all over the island. And while I had my differences over the design of the EOC, I know it's now going to serve even more public functions. And the training of the search teams are very important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think you're right. Councilmember Desai This is coming out of our general fund, the debt service. But I think one of the high priorities of our residents is public safety and they want to know that when there's an emergency that our our public safety first responders get to them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so part of that is having the appropriate facilities to house both our public safety first responders and their equipment that help keep us safe. So I'm supporting this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll be brief and echo the comments of my three colleagues. And then also, you know, this is way overdue and I appreciate the work of Mr. Horn to figure out a way that we can do these two important projects together and actually do it more cost effective.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you very much for your hard work on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also appreciate combining the bid process to save money. However, I'm not satisfied with the answer from our finance person that the general fund in regards to the General Fund 6.9 million over 20 years will just come from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unfortunately, that it doesn't just come from the general fund. We do have if you look at the city's multiyear budget, we are running deficits in the future. We also have the highest unfunded OPEB liabilities in the county as a percentage of our annual general fund, as in its 140% greater than our annual general fund revenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is a serious problem. I think it's incumbent upon staff and the council to designate where the money will be coming from. And I would prefer waiting until we go through the budget process and answer that question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to I like to move recommendation to staff report to adopt plans and specifications and authorize a call for bids for fire station number three. Number PTW 1214. Dash 18.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you have a second.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. I oppose the vote passes 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Six e recommendation to award contract in the amount of 256,292 to cultivate studio and urban planning partners to prepare the Main Street Neighborhood Specific plan for Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Mayor Spencer, council members. I want to introduce myself. I'm Liv Kushner. I've been working for the city since September, so. Not so long. So I haven't had an opportunity to meet some of you, but very excited to be here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll be talking about the main street specific plan just to give you guys a little bit of background on the a little bit of background since it's late on what's come up before this. In 2000, eight city staff applied to MTC to have Alameda Point named a priority development area PDA.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is basically some there's a bunch of PDAs around the Bay Area basically allows us to receive grants for planning documents and for transportation. This is the same kind of grant that staff applied for and want to fund the town center plan, which was approved in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we've then applied for and received been awarded this grant in late 2014 to pay for the Main Street neighborhood specific plan. These kinds of specific plans, they all are required by the Alameda Point Zoning, which was passed by City Council in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it may seem that there are. Quite a few documents about how made a point in having worked here for a few months and read some of them. There definitely are. But these specific plans go into more detail than the master infrastructure plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Zoning. They go into a finer grain of detail about these subdistricts, and we'll talk about what specific plans do and what specific plans don't do. They do serve as a platform for extensive community outreach. They create essentially a framework for the built environment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The community gets to dove in and talk about, you know, what these neighborhoods could look like. The they inform a street typology. So, you know, will the streets be wide? Will they be narrow? What will the streets and what with the open spaces as well look like?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also. Should say. That the specific plan specifically for Main Street will allow the Alameda Point Collaborative APEC to move forward with their development plans. So as you can see, they have quite a bit of property in the Main Street neighborhood and they are looking to consolidate and build new buildings for the supportive housing that they offer'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for the community. And because the zoning requires the specific plan to be completed and approved before any development happens, they are waiting for this document to be written and approved. But I do want to clarify that specific plans do not commit the city to any sort of development timeline, and they do not address disposition issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They are strictly a planning document to talk about a framework for future development. If a council decides they want it to go forward at some time in the future does not supersede Council's ultimate authority to deal with disposition issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And finally, the specific plan does not allocate housing units between different neighborhoods. So speaking more directly about the process for this particular specific plan, staff issued an RFP in September 2014 to over 160 firms architecture, landscape architecture, engineering, urban design firms.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We received five proposals and these proposals were reviewed by a selection committee that comprised staff representatives from Alameda Point Collaborative, the planning board, as well as someone from the Alameda Association of Realtors. Of the five firms that submitted bids, the selection committee reviewed three selected.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Three of the different submissions to review tend to interview. And of those three, it was unanimous among the selection committee that Urban Planning Partners was head and shoulders above the competition. Specifically, some of their strengths are community outreach.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we called all of their references, they all said that they had a real ability to speak both the language of municipal government and of communities and to bridge the gap that sometimes exists between the two. They have excellent design skills and placemaking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the things that staff agreed was that their the proposal was very not only very well thought out, but very appealing esthetically. And that kind of attention to esthetic detail can really speak to what kinds of designs are put into the illustrative, not illustrative plans, excuse me, are put into planning documents and thought about what the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'neighborhood may look like in the future. They also have a supporting housing expert, a historic preservation expert, and interestingly, they have an urban agriculture expert on their team. You know, your first thought is what is an urban agriculture expert?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I thought it was very interesting because specifically the Main Street neighborhood has an existing urban agriculture facilities with plowshares, as well as the urban farm. And I thought it showed staff thought it showed a real attention to detail for this is what's in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is what could be done to leverage the existing facilities in the neighborhood to increase the community benefit. And it just showed a strong attention to detail. Finally, financial. This is a $250,000 grant from Mtc's staff is the city is matching that with staff time as well as an additional just over $6,000 because the cost of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'consultant exceeds the $250,000. That's my presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any quick clarifying questions. Member Data.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me hear what your thoughts are on this issue. I think in a way, city council as well as staff have to act like a master developer, that we have to take a look at what we're doing at Parcel A in conjunction with, say, the Main Street neighborhood in conjunction with, say, the historic'",
        "'speaker_7': 'district. We have to look at how all these different interact. Understanding that there are different needs and different place in it in the different sub areas. So are you saying that if we move forward with the Main Street neighborhood planning, that there's enough flexibility in there to deal with issues in different areas that might be somehow treated'",
        "'speaker_7': 'by planning in, say, the Main Street neighborhood? Let me give you a case case example. Overall, we have a 1400 residential unit number for Alameda Point of the 1400. We're looking at roughly 800, possibly at the parcel, a specific town center.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, that means that there's roughly 600 to be divided somewhere at Alameda Point, some of which will be at Main Street neighborhood, some of which could be at the at the historic area, the adaptive reuse area. As we move down the pike with Main Street area, at some point in time, we're going to move down the pike'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with Alameda. The adaptive reuse area and the adaptive reuse area has certain costs there unknown. But we know that there are costs that are associated with dealing with the historic structures, costs which would be in part underwritten by the ABI residential parcel potentially.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So to the extent that we isolate in on the remaining 600 balance or Main Street neighborhood, that could then have some effect in terms of residential for the historic area. So the question is, is there enough flexibility to take in the fact that there are these different areas, these different costs in different neighborhoods, and that the residential'",
        "'speaker_7': 'outside of parts of L.A. now is getting less and less. And yet it's the residential that is potentially a source to help, not the full answer, but to help deal with these different costs in different areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm glad you asked that question. Yeah. I mean, there is definitely a amount of flexibility in these documents. They do look at, you know, first I should say, as I should repeat, that it doesn't the document specific plans do not allocate housing units directly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they are a higher level view. And they they they do talk about the different financing issues. But specifically, you're just as these documents allow the flexibility by creating a framework within which development can happen. So they're not directly they want spillover from I guess I'm what if this is what you're asking they don't spillover from one'",
        "'speaker_8': 'district to another. Right. So it'll it'll give you the framework for what the street neighborhood may look like physically, and it'll give you a sense of the density of what the development may happen. But it it's not going to directly apportion different housing units to different neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what you're asking it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Part I am partly asking about apportionment apportioning quantitative units, but it's also apportioning types of units because to the extent that you say that, that the adaptive reuse place is going to have. Actually, to the extent that you say Main Street neighborhood is going to have single family homes rather than multi-family homes, that has fiscal impacts in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'terms of revenue generation, feed generation that could be used towards dealing with, say, the costs that that are the historic renovation costs in the historic resource area. So it's not just a number of quantities of where the quantities are allocated, but it's also knowing that we're going to have enough flexibility in terms of the types of housing'",
        "'speaker_7': ', because whatever business deal that we strike with whomever is as the main street area, there might be more revenue generation through single family homes rather than multi-family homes and is in it. And it doesn't matter whether it's multi-family homes, single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We can only deal with 600.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is the flexibility that we need to deal with those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How much? Is there a question?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the question is, is there left flexibility?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, the answer is yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can I kind of add to that? Can you kind of explain to some of us new on the council what exactly is going to be in this specific plan? Because, you know. I've been told there's location studies in there, but then maybe that's not true.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then there's, you know, financial analysis. My concern is not getting to count somebody's socks when he said they're 625. You know, we have to take care of APC and of that 200 and we're only left with 425, so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct, I guess. So what when we see this stock, I mean, what what are we going to see, you know, in layman's terms or or rookies on the council?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. Specific plan generally includes, you know, they'll be chapters about building typology and street typology. So talking about the physical nature of the space and what the open spaces look like, how they may be arranged. There also is a financial analysis that looks at the different costs and how things different unit types and how things may pay'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for different types of financial strategies that that we may take to move forward. There's also. Let me think about. They're kind of the constraints issues, right. So you look at the types of. Constraints that we face. So like the first chapter is basically going to look at, you know, what are the seismic issues, what are the, you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'know, floodplain issues, how do they affect this specific area and, you know, as opposed to just the base as a whole? And so you get a chapter on constraints. You get, you know, a section of finance, you get a section on the built environment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's kind of a big picture of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then what are you using as the base? I mean, are you using an idea of 600 units, 400 units? I mean, or there has to be some, you know, some guidelines where you're going forth and doing the specific plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. I I think there's a there's an ultimate sense that Main Street neighborhood is going to be of much of a lower density than the town center. We're also very aware, you know, that there's a limit on the number of housing that can happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so the documents definitely take that information in mind, but it won't specifically say, you know, this number of units have to go here and this have to go here and you have to keep these things in mind as you go forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it won't be specifically dictating those things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other council questions at this point? Hey, I have a question. We had spoken before as a council in regards to transportation plan, and I don't know if you were aware of that conversation. That's my understanding. At some point, staff will be coming back to us in regards to an overall transportation plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will this be considered in that plan or will we be or are we being asked to approve more housing without a transportation plan?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I know you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So we will be coming on March 12th to talk about a response to I'm sorry, 10th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Night.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At 12 at night. Now March 10th next week to respond to Councilmember de.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'SAG's referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Regarding a comprehensive citywide transportation solution, Alameda Point in particular already has an approved transportation demand management plan, which is essentially a transportation strategy, gets into a lot of detail about costs, how we're going to fund it, what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Services are going to be provided, how fast those services are going to be provided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who gets to do a lot of detail that was approved in May of last year, and then every project that comes through is then required to actually submit and get approved at what's called a TDM compliant strategy or essentially a transportation compliance strategy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So they have to show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has to show how they're in compliance with that overall. AMI 2.2 plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we absolutely have a plan for transportation at AMI two point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This project was contemplated as part of the Aluminum Point EIA Environmental Impact Report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which studied.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All the potential traffic impacts related to the 1425 units in the five and a half million square feet of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Commercial.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we believe that we have we've addressed these issues, but these issues as the team plan, clearly states are going to evolve over time, have to adjust. We have to adjust what's successful, what's not successful. And so a big part of that plan is monitoring, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every year, doing surveys. What's working, what's not working? Are we meeting our goals? And if we're not meeting our.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Goals and things aren't working.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Then how do we.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tweak things? We might need to spend more money to do something to be more effective. And so these plans, even though we've put in the framework and we've approved them with a lot of detail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There needs to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Constant kind of monitoring and evolution of those plans to make sure that they're successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as part of this plan, will there be a designation, for instance, of affordable housing for seniors or affordable housing for vets or affordable housing for families?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, the the settlement agreement with the city has requires 25% affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All new market rate units, which that settlement actually actually excludes the collaborative units. So in addition to.'",
        "'speaker_3': '200 supportive housing units gained rebuilt the new facility, which is the plan that provides supportive housing for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Veterans, for women.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Survivors of domestic women.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And children, survivors of domestic violence, and families at risk of homelessness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are the 200 units that are being rebuilt on site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then an additional 25%, which will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be 9%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Moderate income, 10% low income and 6% very low income. So it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually when you actually add those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Together to even.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, it's going to be over 30%, you know, even more of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in regards to the selection of so it's my understanding we're being asked to approve the selection of a specific planner this up. And have they done any projects for the city of Alameda in the past?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Uh, uh. They worked in, uh. A while ago on the on the northern waterfront, they did community meeting facilitation and they worked at the city's behest to. There was a citizen advisory council that the 15 member citizen advisory council that they worked with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that included in the report tonight? I didn't see it in there. And I just think that if we have if they if an entity has done work with us in the past, that should be included and disclosed to the public when you recommend not use specifically, but when they're being recommended again, because the public then will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know if they may have an opinion, if they agreed with the projects that a certain company had been involved with in the past. Does that could be included in the future?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So they were involved with the Northern.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They worked on a quite a few projects out at the base as well as the Northern Waterfront. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then do you know specifically what people were involved on the panel from the community that are not staff members?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this the silver lining?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mm hmm. It was Doug Biggs from APC, as well as Donna Alvarez. Is that her last name? Tanya Alvarez. And then, I don't know the name of the woman from the Alameda Association of Realtors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to Bartolo. Thank you, Stephane.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there was really one member of the public and a buyer leaving this because I believe Doug Biggs works for APC and Donya is on our commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And, um. And then the timeline to accept this grant. When when does that expire? The current grant is the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With the grants. You know, we've accepted the grant. We're slightly ahead of schedule for some of the other communities, municipalities. But there's there's not necessarily a timeline. If we delay beyond a certain amount, it's possible that they ask us to reapply for the next grant cycle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I don't know of a specific timeline. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so in regards to narrowing it down to one firm that's being recommended, do you know what criteria was used?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I think our choice is really to go with this one as well. You really asking us to approve one planner this evening?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. This is the you know, the selection committee reviewed all the different applicants and decided this firm was superior. I can read you the selection criteria. Would you like that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A the consultant teams project manager and key staff persons, persons past experience and results with similar projects and demonstrated expertize outlined in section four. Role of the consultant. Of this request for proposals. B The consultant teams demonstrated understanding of the proposed project in the Alameda community and of the need for an efficient and effective approach to successfully'",
        "'speaker_8': 'completing the project. C The consultant team's ability to deliver a high quality, specific plan within the budget amount of $256,500 in 12 months schedule. D The consultant team's ability to meet the city's standard contract requirements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And in regards to the the percentage of far below market rate housing. Is it possible that this planet could come back with a higher percentage of below market rate housing than the 30%? Because I think we all know that the 200 are used all the time that we could.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Absolutely. Is a greater percentage in our community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sure we belong to look into that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One more question, but I think I've already asked question if there is a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am Mormon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, and that the mayor's comment about the affordable housing just reminded me. I really like this yuppie consultant agreement exhibit too, and I think this is pretty exciting. But it does have this section on phasing and financing that I think you use the term fine grained Mr. Christian, but it talks about the cultivate slash urban planning partners'",
        "'speaker_6': 'team will identify existing priorities and conditions that will impact implementation and establish a plan for the chronological order and location of proposed development. This chapter on phasing and financing will include a financing strategy for infrastructure, transportation, affordable housing, open space and other capital improvement elements necessary for specific planning implementation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then into the next paragraph it talks about. In addition, the strategy will include discussion of how financing needs relating to the reconstruction of the supportive housing facilities. At some point, collaborative can be integrated with the overall specific plan implementation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is assumed that the affordable housing developers selected by the locals, supportive housing providers and or collaborative representatives will provide information on project financing gaps, i.e. subsidy needs that would remain after accounting for anticipated project revenues, tax credits and other affordable housing funding sources that the developer anticipates utilizing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate that depth of information being in there and also that people who know a whole lot more about financing affordable housing projects. I know it's a lot of cobbling together of different sources from the ones that I've seen, but I know that they'll do their best to include as much affordable housing as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, is this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm just asking is that that would be part of the to look at how much affordable housing could go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I have a question. Yes. Now the the parcel a process started the specific planning process started by getting. So I think it was someone to be the outfit that did the specific planning for parcel a which kind of which did a great job of kind of filtering out, tweaking what we had done through the zoning process'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And I imagine that for the Main Street neighborhood yuppie, that would do the same. Now the thing about the parcel a so and process, the city council was not as involved in that process. So what thoughts have you given to having council involved in the process with through that this process and Main Street neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That we're definitely committed to involving council in the in moving forward with Main Street specific plan in much the same way that we're doing with the city development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Wonderful. That's great news. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. My question back on flexibility. Hypothetically, this is Question Time. Hypothetically, if the council later on today says we just want you to focus this specific plan, the priority is the 200 HPC replacement units. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we're not going to prioritize the remaining 425 or the remaining part of of the main street neighborhood. Is there a flexibility in this specific plan that we're going to ask to, that we can separate an evaluation of APC and from the rest?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if we want to move forward with APC and we want to shelve the rest or delay the rest for some undetermined period of time, will that flexibility if the council decides they want to do that well, that flexibility be in there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a good question. I would imagine, like you can defer to Jim, but I would imagine that we would since we're required to do this document, it would make the most sense to do the whole neighborhood while we're at it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, if you've got the hood up, might as well do the work on the entire neighborhood. And then you can always choose to move forward in phasing as council decides. You know, and again, this this specific point doesn't really speak to disposition, you know, issues such as that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is really just creating a framework and city council can decide as at a later date to move forward and whatever phasing they decide. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just want to add, as I think we could absolutely. In this specific plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think Doug.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Biggs executive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is probably going to make sure we do this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that we create a phasing plan that contemplates them moving forward without the rest of the neighborhood. So that when we talk about our infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And financing and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Implementation approach in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The specific plan, we do it for the whole neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that we're very clear that there's a way that this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Project, his project, can move forward without the rest of the neighborhood and start. And if there's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some potential infrastructure issues with that that we outline what those are, so that it's very clear how he can march.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Without the rest of the neighborhood. I think we can absolutely do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that we would probably be. He's going to make sure we do that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now remember questions. We have a speaker, Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Speaking of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for being so patient.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good morning. My name's Doug Biggs. I'm executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess since I'm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not a member of a public, I get to talk a little longer than 3.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Minutes. Thank you very much, Mayor. Appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'll try not to. ABC as you do know, I was a partner of the grant submission to the MTC which has funded this proposed project. Our role in the project is a critical component since we make up the bulk of the housing and community space that's in this area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A key outcome of the proposed project is to do a site and financial analysis looking at alternative locations in the Main Street area within which we can rebuild our community. I can't overstate how important it is to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I can't read this thing right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't overstate how important it is to us and our families that we have housing that supports efforts to overcome homelessness and allow children and families to thrive. As I like to tell folks and some of you have heard me say this before, I think we've built a pretty amazing community out there with really crappy housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we could do so much more with accessible, appropriately sited housing. We can't get there, though, unless we take this important step.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as was mentioned previously.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to have a specific plan in order to move forward on any development out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that's part of the agreement that's in place. We need to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Look at alternative locations because that's going to impact the financing. And you can't do that in isolation of just doing that component. You have to look at what's going in around you, what's potentially going in around you, whether that's phased in later or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so it all is kind of tied together and it's hard to pull out one piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The grant was awarded in June.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of 2014 and written up in the local papers. Shortly after the grant was awarded, we worked with the city to help identify prospective planning firms. We brought to the process skill sets around supportive housing that we would want to see in a firm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We wanted firms that would be able to talk our language and know the people that we're working with. After RFQ was sent out, there was a well-attended applicant briefing that was held to discuss the project, and we participated in that as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once the applications were received, interviews were held and we participated in those. And as live mentioned, while there were several firms that impressed us, Urban Planning Partners brought a breadth of experience and approach that was very much in tune with our desire to build on the successes we had already achieved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We believe that the UP team has excellent, supportive housing expertize and one of their team members, Bruce McCuddy, who's actually worked with us for several years on community planning efforts. He understands our community. He understands the people we're working with, and we're really excited about Sage, the urban agriculture experts, because bringing them in really indicates that they're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'willing to work with what's out there already. They're willing to help us create an innovative, sustainable main street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to build on the work we've.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Already started. DeLay of this project can greatly impair our ability to provide the services our residents need and desire. Moving forward will provide critical information and data that can inform our process. At the end of the day, though, as has been mentioned several times tonight, this is a planning process only it does not break any ground.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It does not approve any development. It only informs and as we tell our youth every day at our education center, information empowers leaders, approve this contract and allow us to move forward. Thank you very much. And I'd be glad to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Do we have any comments?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor What I'd like to get out of this for Alameda is, number one, that we take advantage of spending other tax dollars that don't come directly from our general fund. So that's number one. Number two, I'm looking at the tasks that have to happen, and I would like to prioritize the repair, upgrade, redesign and rebuilding of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the 200 collaborative units as the top priority. I'm looking at test number two, where where it says cultivate up will prepare a market assessment of various housing types and densities. And then working off this marketing study and in meetings at Task one, they will prepare a series of site planning alternatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to have them include a site planning alternative that caps the number of units to what exists they. Not what was talked about in 2008 or in 2012 or 2014, because those didn't anticipate the multifamily overlays outside of the base and the northern waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to have an alternative that's discussed that that puts the cap. On on building new units over and above. What's there? I'd like. An alternative that preserves the neighborhood around the big white. I'd like an alternative and that comes back to the Council for a preferred alternative is selected so that the council is the gatekeeper'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of what's the preferred alternative. I think it's very important to look at this not only in the context of other development at the base, but the other development in the rest of the city. And I think that goes back to the comments about addressing the transportation, addressing it both locally in and in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's that's what I'd like to see us. When in place is controls and guidance for this group provide us with a specific plan because that specific plan is going to be the foundation of how we zone it and then what's built there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Make no mistake.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Amber Ashcraft So I was thinking about this. Mike Grant It's it's pretty impressive that we have this $250,000 grant to work with and, you know, $6,000 of our own money. But we're leveraging quite a bit because when I represented Alameda on the Alameda County Transportation Commission in the last administration, it was a constant source of frustration to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'me that I would see these MTC grants being doled out to other communities around this large table. And Alameda wasn't even eligible because we had very few PDAs planned development areas because at that point we still hadn't had the conveyance from the Navy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it wasn't our property. We couldn't do, you know, the things that were required to get this grant. And so this is public money and yet it was going to trust me. And Oakland got a lot of it, but every every other jurisdiction around the table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So now we're in a position to take advantage of this. And I did enjoy reading the staff report in the consultant agreement, and I did have some questions that I emailed to staff earlier. And one of the a couple of things that I want to make sure are incorporated is I asked if our existing development guidelines require'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that new construction be energy efficient or achieve zero net energy objectives. If not, how can we include these objectives in this specific plan? And the answer I got was that staff intends to address sustainability issues in the Main Street specific plan, much as was done with the recently completed town center plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I, I'm also pleased to see that there will be sustainable streets. So again, not just complete streets that look at all different modes and users, not just autos, but bicycle, pedestrian transit, but also taking the concept one step further, including bio swales or something similar to treat runoff on site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I love the urban agriculture component of this and that's important for so many reasons. First of all, there's not a lot of places around the Bay Area where you have urban agriculture. And I have been out there. Mr. Biggs gave me a lovely I think we walked for 3 hours one day tour and his residents in a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lot of them, the young people are out there and they're working in these various agriculture enterprises, whether it's the beekeeping or the planting and the orchards and plowshares is lovely. And I want to see and you know, we're doing a community garden at the Jean Sweeney Open Space Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, this is something Alameda can really be known for. And so I'm glad to see that that's a big part of this specific plan. And I'm the OC and so I think it was Councilmember de SAC raised this my question was with regard to the preferred alternative selection, I wrote how and when does City Council offer'",
        "'speaker_6': 'its input on development and evaluation of these alternatives? It seems like everyone but the City Council will be consulted, yet we have ultimate responsibility for approving the draft specific plan. I prefer a process similar to what we're doing with City I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Monthly updates to the Council with Opportunity for input and I. The response I got was that's what we're going to do. And a couple of things that I especially like about this was the development standards I thought were very well stated, the flexible form based standards regarding existing historic structures and compatible new construction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know Christopher Buckley has left, but he would he would like that too. And finally, in the in the agreement on pages 17 and 18, I said I'm very cool online participation platform, so not everyone can come to a meeting that lasts until 1230 at night, but everyone can sit at their computer or a computer somewhere and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'let your your thoughts and your your opinions about this Plan B be heard. So I'm looking forward to seeing this go forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, Audie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this was the other item that I was very torn on. In addition to the weather one. You know, in an ideal world, we would put this off, we would take care of make a decision on siting and see where we're going on site, a work on a site, B, developing the enterprise zone and put off the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'decision on more housing until we're further down the road on site A and we've had an opportunity as a council to evaluate traffic and show the public that we're taking the results of the election seriously. But on the other side, you know, we have the 200 substandard units that the folks in APC are living on a living'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in. So we need to, you know, rebuild and relocate that the APC housing, I mean an ideal world we'd have that inside a and then we wouldn't have to worry about this and we could push this off for another couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I don't think that's going to happen. But these people need better housing. They need to be better situated. They had the same infrastructure issues in the housing that we've heard from the business, the businesses that are out at Almeida Point, you saw the map.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They have a huge footprint. We want to have a smaller footprint for APC. So. I, I like the idea that the Vice Mayor suggested that we really have a robust series of site planning alternatives. Again, if APEC was not in here, I would not be voting to move this forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just say, let's not deal with Main Street neighborhood until we've we've taken care of site. But, you know, we do have a social responsibility to the folks that live in APC to get them out of their substandard housing as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'd like to see the, you know, the hypothetical I mentioned where, you know, we focus on taking care of APC and, you know, the alternatives, maybe some that turns out do nothing. Maybe the alternatives are having the cap.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maybe, you know, the alternatives, you know, are banking the land and dealing with it, you know, in five or ten years, I don't know. But I'd like to see those alternatives, but not hold up the process of of taking care of the APC residents and getting them into higher quality housing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you. First and foremost, I want to say thank you very much to Doug Biggs for coming out to my office hours this past Thursday. We had a great conversation. He, you know, let me know about the planning that the homeless collaborative Alameda Point Collaborative has undertaken and why this is an important step in moving that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'along. It seems to me that in moving forward with the Main Street neighborhood, we can certainly help his cause even more. And it is important to remember that, you know, base conversion isn't just about, you know, working with the catalysis of the world or working with the streams of the world or the slums of the world.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it is intimately about also working with the Alamo to point collaborative of the world for that reason, you know, to give real meaning to turning arms into plowshares. I think it's a vital part or what we're all about at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I think we should, you know, be unapologetic in and in doing what we can to assist Alameda Point Collaborative in achieving their goals. From my take, I think the framework began when it comes to residential is the 1425 and of that 1425 we're looking at roughly 800 for parcel a and I hear clearly what staff is'",
        "'speaker_7': 'saying with regard to Main Street that that we're not locking in into any particular numbers. But I do want to raise, though, that the point that Vice Mayor Matt R.C. raised in terms of putting a cap that could have substantive effects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't I think, you know, if Vice Mayor Matt, R-S.C., would like to include a cap in his in his approach, then I say, fine, include that in your one of your analyzes. But as one of the analyzes, because it seems to me that if you put a cap based upon what's existing there now in total'"
