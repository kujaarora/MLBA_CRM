        "'speaker_0': 'Just give us the the overview. And actually, in the spirit of full disclosure, I did reach out to Ms.. Potter this afternoon kind of late and asked a couple of questions. And do you want to just but why don't you give the audience a sense of what this project is?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because it's it's really important. And I think it's one of the things that makes Alameda a compassionate community. That's absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My pleasure. The staff came before the council in originally on this project in November of 2017, and we had recommended as part of implementing a referral that the City Council had adopted earlier about assisting refugee and immigrant families in Alameda, that we had been contacted by a nonprofit organization in the city, starting with the Catholic Deanery here'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in Alameda, who was taking Pope Francis's call that if every parish I think that's what if every parish housed a refugee family, it would go a long way to meeting the needs of refugees worldwide. And they wanted to work to do some refugee resettlement here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We were enthusiastic about that proposal because the council did have its referral about assisting immigrant and refugee families. And we identified a house out at the base, one of the ranch houses that was not habitable because it needed foundation work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we thought that would be a great opportunity to use CDBG funds to fix the Houses Foundation, have it become habitable, and then contract with the nonprofit to do refugee family resettlement on a transitional basis as families. Where we settled the house would then turn over and it would be able to serve another refugee family for the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'next 15 years. In November of 2017, the council approved that initiative, which we had anticipated might cost about $120,000. And unfortunately, just given the world of contracting and the world of getting bids, we we found that the cost of doing this work was $400,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we wanted to bring this item back to council and have the council weigh in if there was a desire to continue to move forward. We have these CDBG funds that are budgeted in the substantial rehab program. Under CDBG, the funds are budgeted and we can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have identified a contractor. We have the housing authority will project manage the project on behalf of the city and we can get the work done. And hopefully before November of 2019, we will be able to get a family into a house that is currently not habitable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that is the request this evening for the council to authorize staff to move forward with the negotiation and award of the contract to to do this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And just to to amplify a little bit, the the bid that the lowest responsive bid you got was 400,000. And then a contingency fund of about $60,000 is added for unanticipated things that often come up in the course of construction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's there, but then beyond the foundation work, then this nonprofit will step in to do the rest.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They do, though, if you can imagine, the house has not been rented for several years. It needs new flooring, new carpeting, new painting, that kind of thing that the nonprofit working with congregants and that kind of thing will be taking on that additional work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Nice job. Does anyone have any questions or comments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Miss Potter. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One quick.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Note.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just to verify it's in the staff report, but I just want to make it clear for the public, this is not. There's no impact on the general fund. This is all out of CDBG funds, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So I'd like to move approval of the item.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. Hi. Hi. Okay. The motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Good work, Council, because this continues to be a very important issue. Okay. Moving on then to the regular agenda. The first item is adoption of resolutions, appointing members to a couple of of our commissions and boards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have resolutions appointing Amy Barnes to the Recreation and Parks Commission provider, right to the Social Service Human Relations Board and Rebecca Colston Parsons and Tina U.N. to the Transportation Commission. And are there any questions or comments from council move.'",

We have some, for instance, Rebecca Coles, Jan Parsons, who is up here now, and I served on the Planning Commission together, but she's a seasoned veteran'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the transportation industry. Prior to Wright, who is next to her, is going to be on our Social Services Human Relations Board. She is currently a caseworker, added Alameda Point Collaborative and has a wonderful life story herself and is bringing her talents to APEC in a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And next to her is a rock star, a relatively new resident to Alameda, but works in the area of public transportation in city planning and is an avid public transit user herself. And Amy Barnes is a mother of young children, lives on the West End and very enthusiastic new member of our Recreation Parks Commission.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We have speakers on this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We want just one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, mayor and council. I'm Amy Aldridge, interim assistant city manager and Recreation and Parks Director. So tonight, here it is. We're going to discuss the status of the AMA, heard from center at alameda high school and various options and really, most importantly, immediate next steps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do want to introduce Shahrukh Khan, who is the Alameda Unified School District's chief business officer, who's here who was gracious enough to come tonight. So he is here in the audience for some quick background. This is an overhead of of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is a locker rooms, swimming pool and a dove pool. The dove pool is smaller and deeper. And that's just a quick overview in terms of background. It is an old facility. It's approximately 60 years old. The swimming pool itself was retrofitted in 1990 and the dove pools retrofitted in the mid 1980s.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some background of of our history with county health is in 2010 they issued a notice of closure due to public safety and other concerns and code violations. The Health County Health School District City got together at that time and developed some short term fixes and there are quite a few new filters, new heaters, new chlorine system, a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'new chemical feed controller that increase the water flow rate and at that time promised the county health that a long term solution would be put into place in 2013. Additional mechanical equipment repairs were done. Most of the pump room was replaced.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There was pipe leaking, pipe pipe replacements. And in 2015, the new pool opened at an Arsenal high school. That one was chosen to be replaced first because it was in essentially worse condition than than Amad. So this is just to give you a background that really this has been discussed for quite a few, many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some additional background is that we do have a joint use agreement between the city of Alameda and Alameda Unified School District that used to be that the city operated and maintained the pools. That was changed a couple of years ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So AOC now operates and maintains the pools. Throughout that time, both the city and school district pay half of the total operational costs. Just recently, county health, which is why we're here tonight, issued a notice of health concerns and they informed the school district that the facility would be red tagged, essentially closed May 31st after the school'",
        "'speaker_6': 'swim season. So per this notice, they are clear that the pools will be closed unless they are repaired, fully repaired, replaced or removed. So the school district, city and city has a standing subcommittee meeting. They met on February 13th and they asked both staff of both agencies to prioritize this issue and bring it back to their respective'",
        "'speaker_6': 'board and council. So these are the primary code violations. I'm not going to go into great depth. I'm happy to answer any questions. One is that at this facility, the two pool, there are two pools, and they're essentially is one pipe system and one pump room that serves both pools normally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And per code, the pools would be separate to a separate pump systems, essentially, so that you can verify that each pool is meeting the turnover rate of water. I did meet with County Health last week and I'll explain a little bit more about that meeting in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there was a recent relatively minor fix to an area that was able to increase the rate of that flow. And and county health was was happy to hear where that was at. Some of the other code violations are refinishing the plaster and the pools slip and fall cracks and concerns about the pool deck as well as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a lack of overall ADA access and clearly overall and they're just generally in very outdated, poor condition. I wanted to give you a sense of the current use, both of the pools. Obviously, we have the school, water polo, swim and dove teams and then the community has very large and active youth swim and water polo teams as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'well as adult masters swim and polo teams. Our city programs are primarily in the summer. We have swim lessons and lap swim. Limited amounts of those in the spring. A huge amount of use for about 8 to 10 weeks, depending on the summer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For youth swim lessons and for lap swim, family swim. Recreation swim. We do not use the city does not currently program a use of either pool during the school day. Also, just to give you a sense that during the school year, those groups combined, not including our PD programs, are using it from 530 in the morning until'",
        "'speaker_6': 'school start. And then as soon as school is out until 9:00 at night and all day on weekends and then on the weekday weekends, I'm sorry, in the summer times, it's really all day. Every day. So it's it's despite the poor condition, it's a heavily used pool facility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is really just to give you a sense of the numbers of people using the pools, but also the fact that when you look at the percent of Alameda residents, it's really Alameda residents using this pool. It's extremely high numbers compared to other cities and their program uses and residential rates.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's it's really this is Alameda Pool. I do want to note, because sometimes these numbers are comparative of percentage wise of city use and school use and community use. These numbers aren't exactly apples to apples because for all of the teams, both the community teams and the school teams, you're talking about actual individuals participating in that team'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Whereas for our programs, for something like if you think about lap swim, you're going to have ten people on each go five times a week. And so there are duplicated numbers and same things for there are swim lessons.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So 607 registered, but generally those kids taking those lessons week after week after week. So the school district, once they were informed by county health, they engaged their expert consultant on on swimming facilities. They were involved in the design of the Sentinel High School swim facility, and they created an assessment report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these numbers are from the school district and from their consultant. And the numbers also, I want to be clear assume a projects under DSA requirements to depart the vision of California vision state architecture who oversees and approves all school projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's a little bit different when there's a project on a school versus on city land. So starting from the smallest that's shown on the screen. One option would be to repair the swim pool and close and fill the dove pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would provide continued practice for the teams in the community and in a more limited way because now you don't have the dove pool but would be an option. It doesn't meet the the district's CIF their league requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another and that's again from the report is 1.7 million to repair both pools to based on to make the repairs that count in full that county health wrote up is violations that we discussed earlier would cost per the report about 3.6 million and again still doesn't meet schools requirements but would continue the facilities as a practice facility'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Another option is to replace the pool on these numbers. 5.2 million to 7 million are based on the internal high school swim facility. It would be based on that same layout that would meet schools facilities. It mostly meets the cities and communities needs, but I would say not entirely.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And all of these numbers include a 20% allowance. And on top of the cost that's included in because when you're doing a project would dare say they often open up the entire facility. So the entire Alameda High School for ADA compliance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there's additional costs that that adds to the project. And then the least desirable. But an option is to demolish both cool pools or close them until further until further options are identified. Obviously, it doesn't meet anybody's needs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is still a cost because unless you close and fill them, you still have to keep the the water at certain chemical levels and make sure the flow is happening. And there's certain basic safety aspects and maintenance that has to continue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to pause at this point because this PowerPoint was issued prior to my meeting with Alameda County Health. And so I want to give you an update on that. City staff, myself and our parks manager and our other staff person who's very familiar with the pool, met with three of their three, the county health staff, who'",
        "'speaker_6': 'are all very familiar with this project. And I think there's really opportunities for a significantly lower cost option and for something that can hopefully keep this going in the short term. And I think there's a real opportunity for collaboration here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What they said is they are willing to consider essentially patching. They reckon, well, let me back up. So they recognize that the swim pool plastering is in decent enough condition. It's not a safety hazard. The dove pool is a problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And but they're willing to look at patching the problem areas in a dove pool rather than a full plaster. Same thing with the concrete deck. They're willing to look at repairs, repairing and fixing safety problems, but not necessarily replacing the entire concrete deck.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also similar with the co-mingling water issue. If as long as we got a verified engineer's report that the flow is happening to rate, that is makes it again safe for the public because it's really what it's about is making sure we have a safe facility for the public that that would be acceptable in all of this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to be clear is pending, you know, their final directors report, you know, collaboration. And there's still a lot to happen between here and there, but it was an encouraging conversation. I also want to clarify that all of this, you know, lower cost option is also contingent upon the city and school district, bringing them an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'action plan. They want to see movement and they want to see concrete move in movement that happens moving forward for full replacement of the swim facility. They also want us obviously to work very closely in what those short and long term plans are and what that action plan is, and make sure we're getting the required permits through'",
        "'speaker_6': 'them. I also want to be very clear that the May 31st deadline is not changing, and they were clear on that. And I agree that. If we can make the repairs that are sufficient, suitable that they agree upon the county health and that we are able to make if we can make those before and get them done'",
        "'speaker_6': 'before May 31st, the pool will stay open. If we can't get that done, that May 31st, despite whatever great plan we may have put in front of them, will still close until we get those repairs in place. So there could be a period conceivably of of disrupted service in there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to be forthright with the community that that we're moving as fast as we can. But that May 31st deadline is still there. So obviously, all this requires final approval from the county, as well as action and agreements between our partnerships with the city and the school district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I do think it's an opportunity to work collaboratively together. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So any clarifying questions about the staff report and then did the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had a couple of more slides, but I'm happy to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear the can we hear the rest of the report? You have a question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Specific to this. Okay. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's the cost? You said it's perhaps it's a little bit different from the other numbers previously listed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm hesitant to give a clear cost because we haven't gotten contractors out there to identify exactly how much patch work needs to happen. I mean, it would be a fraction of the lowest cost is, you know, somewhere south of half a million, certainly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But. But I don't want to give. I don't. But that's what the big caveat of not having contractors looked at it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just wanted to. Okay. And then and these are for, as you put it, repairs kind of to keep it going for a period of time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These would be repairs to make it safe for the public for a short term fix until we can put a long term action plan in place for the long term replacement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How long would that short term fix me? How short is that short term?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, in my conversation, they you know, they felt like as long as you say for the public, though. So, for example, if the pool were plastering, if we fix those areas, but then other areas show up that continue to do laminate and deteriorate, we would need to fix that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But they're okay with the patchwork approach as long as it remains safe for the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And where where would we potentially be looking at to get these funds from the general fund?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have not yet identified funding. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Another clarifying question, Mr. Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have more, but I'll hold those. Just want to follow up on on the last one. I really didn't I wasn't sure if I heard an answer. So how long would the short term how much time with the short term fixes bias?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Six months? Nine months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One year until the new pool is replaced. Until the pool is replaced. So that was they were okay with patching it, providing them with an action plan, with some kind of milestones showing that we're making progress towards a full replacement because they recognized the fact when I met with them that we can't even if we had all'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the money and all of the design done, it would still take us a year or two, you know, to get really get moving, right? So they recognize it'll take 2 to 4 years, but they felt like if we have clear milestones that are agreed upon that we meet, then they're okay with us continuing to essentially limp'",
        "'speaker_6': 'along with this patchwork until we get a new pool in place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any further clarifying questions? Okay. Please continue. Line. Perfect. Please continue your presentation, Ms..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So some ideas for short and long term solutions that have been discussed in the short term. What was discussed at the subcommittee is potentially appointing an ad hoc working committee that would be comprised of potentially members of this body, as well as members of the school board, as well as staff and potentially a couple key community members'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to provide input as well so that it's a truly collaborative process. Clearly, we would need to have more meetings with county health. That was part of my conversations and they were more than willing because they recognized the need for this in the community to meet on site with the contractor, with the school district and say, okay, here's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'exactly what work needs to be done to their satisfaction, for example, in terms of long term. There's been a long list. I think this is an opportunity in that for many years even predates me. There's been conversation about the need for a city swimming pool, and this is potentially an option to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An opportunity to do that. Clearly, it would still be available to the school teams, just like all of our facility, athletic facilities are available to them. We would need to consider locations whether we work with the school district somehow to identify that a good area for land and that for to replace it there or potentially look at'",
        "'speaker_6': 'another location. All of that really could be stressed out by this ad hoc committee and then funding to the earlier question. It could include the infrastructure bond. And this is for replacement, full replacement. It could include a potential infrastructure bond in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could include a combination of private donors. So there's that, again, would need to be identified as the funding. In terms of opportunities for Citi Swim Center, it would provide for year round programing, which is not an opportunity we currently have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Year round programing would allow us to program four tiny top programs, senior aquatic programs, lunchtime lap squats, swim, or other times lap swim. That's a constant request that we get from the city is regular year round lap swim and more year round swim lessons depending on the the weather.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And also just to expand our programing in other ways. Although what a lot of cities do is add a small splash pad, which is basically like a playground with water coming through it, which is really I also get quite a few requests for that from residents just in since I've been here or slides going to the pools'",
        "'speaker_6': '. There's a lot of different ways that many other cities add these components when it's a city pool so that you still have the competitive aspect. But you can add these components to bring in more families and any time you bring kids to the water to get them comfortable is a good in the water is a good thing'",
        "'speaker_6': '. In terms of cost considerations, it definitely is a big, high, high price tag for a pool, both initial construction and finishing the pool as well as ongoing maintenance. And I am always upfront that anything we build cost annually to maintain and will be an extra burden to the general fund or rec fund or other for ongoing maintenance'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Pools do not recover costs. They are far from recovering costs and they are inherently a money loser if we did. It's also been discussed, you know, would the city and again, this is more a long term conversation, but would we look at an indoor facility versus an outdoor facility?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we can certainly look at all those. An indoor facility is appealing in some ways because you can use it year round all the time. One in East Oakland, there's one in Newark, and they're both heavily utilized. And the construction of an indoor pool facility is generally the highest per square foot cost of any public building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can build it. They're expensive and they have a higher maintenance cost just because of the nature of how you have to move the air and all of that. And yet they tend to have higher cost recovery than outdoor pools because you can program them all the time and you can do a lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you look at aquatic over in here in Alameda that is used constantly as an indoor pool, there's always folks in there when swim lessons. So that concludes my report. I'm happy to answer any further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as the gentleman from the school district stroke, you're not planning to present. No. Okay. So we do have, as I have, one public speaker, is there anyone else who is interested in speaking on this? So get up speakers and clarifying questions before the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker Mr. O.D. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just a couple quick ones, Amy. Sorry, before you walk away, I'm sorry. On your on your slide when you talked about the history so the 2011 commitment for a long term solution, what was our long term solution for M0 or did we have one or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do not currently have one between the school district in the city? That was a hope and I think I came in after that. And I think what happened is, is, is resources were put towards internal swim center.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then on the summer plans, I mean, if if it stays red tagged or we don't figure out a way to fund these these repairs, that may be a path forward. I mean, what happens to those programs?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, do we just not do them? Do we kind of absorb them somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Else for our city program? For the city we've already because there's so much uncertainty and we have to put out our activity guide. Now, it's actually being printed as we speak. We have already planned for everything to be moved to and snowstorm center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that's something that will just make it work. What the reality is, it actually means less pool time for the community swim teams.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then the last clarifying question, so that there was a discussion about, you know, transferring property and DSA, can you kind of go over what just high level what the difference between a DSA approved pool that would be presumably on some school property versus a non DSA approved pool that would be on presumably city property?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, sure. So DSA, I'm not as familiar with that, but my my understanding is that so they essentially provide do the full permitting for any school project versus on city land where it goes through the planning board and the city permitting process and plan check and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'DSA also. Has certain requirements, be it earthquake safety ADA requirements and certainly the city on city land, we would have ADA requirements as well for the facility itself. But DSA looks at not only the facility itself of that swim facility, but looks potentially at the entire school facility for ADA improvements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's why the consultant built in the 20% additional cost for those potential other ADA schoolwide improvements, it's arguable whether it takes longer. I think it depends on DSA staffing. Sometimes it takes longer than city plan checks, sometimes similar.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are the primary differences is what the plan check process is and the potential for higher cost with ADA and potentially earthquake improvements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. My last question is of our interim city manager. Do we have an eye? Do you recall? And if you don't, I can wait for the information what our budget surplus was last year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I do not have that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Or the year before. No. And do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We gather that and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we have an idea where we are? Like, we're six months in and we're more than six months and so we should have at least first and second quarter numbers. I mean, do we have an idea where we're where we're trending I think for the current fiscal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Report for your mid-year coming up in. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions before we go to Speaker?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Vela Uh, for the subcommittee. I understand that it would be a couple of members of council. I think we've we've that's been designated and a couple of members of the school district. What would the report back or the process structure look like and what would be kind of the the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The issues that would be discussed by the subcommittee and what would be the process for actually getting it. But are we going to sunshine who they're talking to, who's involved? You know, what are the opportunities for the community to get feedback and for the various boards, for the two different boards to actually weigh in?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A couple of things. So there's a lot in there, I think. I would like to see this committee when they get together, really talk about process. We really haven't flushed that out. And I was hesitant to lay out a process with before that group has convened in terms of sunshine ing and report out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I'm certainly happy to report out each council meeting through made to this body as needed or once a month to report out to the community. Here's what's happening with that. There may be other potential ways we can potentially post minutes or find other ways to let the community know what's happening with this group.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It could be onerous if it were fully public, and now we're getting feedback from anybody who walks in. Really, it would. We have a very short time frame. So I would I my own opinion is that would be very helpful to have a tight working group that can really make make some decisions and choices.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I envisioned that any action plan that came from this group would clearly have to go to each body for final approval and full approval and full discussion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is just for the short term. Yes. So there would be perhaps a different process relative to having a conversation about the long term, like we would lay out parameters of like potential locations, ballpark costs, indoor outdoor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those sorts of questions would be answered by a separate working group. This this subgroup would really be working on the immediate concerns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I envision the subgroup working on immediate concerns and getting twofold. One is on media concerns and getting final buy in with county health on a plan. But that plan to county health also has to include a plan for long term replacement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They don't care if it's going to be indoor or outdoor or how we're going to fund it. Those questions can be answered farther down the road when we're not on such a tight timeframe, but they are going to want to see some kind of milestone plan, such as and some of the examples of what a possibility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Possibilities. I was very clear with them. These were all possibilities pending final approval. But possibilities could be, you know, identifying a location. And so, for example, if we ask the school district to deed over that land so it could be a city project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, seeing in my view of that or if we chose to go the route of funding it through an infrastructure bond, a milestone might be when this body chooses to place that on the ballot and then if it's voted in at the ballot, those are all milestones, examples of milestones that they would want to see.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this action plan, this committee needs to come up with some kind of action plan that will essentially satisfy county health. And so I imagine the group will also at some point be the representatives of or the whole group will be meeting with county health to to flush out this this action plan to make sure it is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'does meet their needs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there's there seems to be a parallel track kind of going on that there would be both the short term and long term discussions with the short term obviously taking priority. But there would need to be I guess what I'm getting at is, is are we going to have an opportunity, Madam Mayor, to agenda?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is this in terms of having a long term conversation from the council so that we can actually give authority, it seems to me, before you actually have the long term conversation. The council needs to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that's a really reasonable question, and I think I even have an answer for you, but I want to save that for when the Council deliberates on after we've had our public speaker. But hold that thought, it's a good one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you have any other clarifying questions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I did have one other clarifying question, and that is, you had also mentioned that there would be potentially members of the community on the subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm throwing it out as an option. I think in terms of a collaborative approach, it's always nice to have constituents be part of a conversation, or even if they're not part of the committee, some way to be checking in with the constituent groups.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Did you have an idea or somebody in mind?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, not yet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The number of people because I noticed on one of the slides you make Slide seven, you list different the different organizations that make use of the pool. Mm hmm. And so how many individuals would we be talking about?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it seems to me like the smaller the group agreed, the better that we also want to have members of the community obviously involved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's a lot of crossover between the groups. So I think I would agree, I think the smaller working group would be more effective. So I imagine just a couple to three most. And I would look to the swim community and aquatics community to help us identify who those people may be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. I have another clarifying question. Singular, plural, whatever, from Mr. O.D. and then we're going to go to our.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry, it was just a follow up follow up on Councilmember Vela's discussion with you. So this potential infrastructure bond. I mean, are you envisioning like a global infrastructure bond? And this would be a piece of it. And if so, how do we actually guarantee that there's money that goes to the poles?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I think I believe the threshold is different. If we say, you know, it's a project, a, you know, versus it's possible projects A through Z.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's a larger discussion as part of an overall infrastructure discussion. But yes, I had imagined it'd be part of a larger global infrastructure bond, not just a bond for a pool. I have seen other cities do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's certainly an option as well. And I think then this body needs to look at an infrastructure bond and whether you identify projects and it's two thirds vote or, you know, 50 plus one vote, I think that's a larger discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we could and I want to just interrupt for one minute to just look to the acting city attorney to make sure we're not going beyond the scope of this agenda item. I do realize that an infrastructure bond is one of the options to be considered, but I'm not sure the deep dove, if that's not too much'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of a pan into all the particulars, is that I'll defer to the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would say a deep dove into the mechanics of an infrastructure bond or outside the scope of this particular hearing. But I also agree with Amy's quick assessment about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, let me just ask it a different way. If we do a global infrastructure bond, is there any guarantee that this money will end up going to poor construction?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it's you know. Absolutely and as best you can identify.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Funny but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really but it becomes it in the deep end here maybe stay a little.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think we're in the deep end because I think if we're going to if we're going to be making a promise to people and say that this is a possible solution, I think we have to be clear with people that it's not a guarantee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I completely agree with you. And when we have that discussion, I think that's the time to do that. But we would probably want a legal analysis of the the structure of a of an infrastructure bond before that time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we could I think we could structure without going into too much detail, but it's all in councils, resolutions, etc.. In terms of the mechanics of issuing the bond, you can be as specific as you want to be or as general as you know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think if you're going to be specific about this, about that, it goes for a particular purpose.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that was the point. So we were clear with the public and if we did do a specific one, what that would require, and if we didn't, what that would require and what that would guarantee. I'm not finished talking I or what, what that would guarantee or what that would not apparently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So that's what I was looking to have an information of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further questions. Okay. We have one public speaker, Barry Parker. Mr. PARKER. Thank you, Miss. By the way, Mr. Voltage. Really well done. Staff report. Thank you. Dr. Parker. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Doctor. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, look at my clothes. No tie.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Mayor Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City Council Persons. And, Amy, that was a phenomenal description. Took everything. The one thing I want to sort of point out is that although the citizenry of Alameda probably looks at that pool as being in the high school pool, go to other communities, there are high school pools and then there are community pools.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We as a city and you as city council people and have an obligation to the citizenry of this town to provide them with something they can use probably the most injury free form of exercise that is known to people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I swam in that pool for about 64 years. That was a a bond issue gym that that was to help the Parks and Recreation Department. But it was earmarked with $600,000. And that built that pool in 1954 for swimming.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was 1955. But I think behind the scenes, if you realize that, that it not only provides the high school with great swimmers, but we have a lot of different programs besides swimming programs. We have we don't have diving programs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do have the Neptune's. And I look at these teams like the Alligator Islander combination now called the Gators. I look at Neptune's sort of like you would look at Little League football or a Little League baseball or the Wolverines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now I think we call them and they are the they are the teams that are going to make the high school teams both Alameda and and so now the great teams that they have become because they have these feeder kids, they just really have excelled in the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I swam age group, high school, college master's. Now Amy was right. That pool is 530 in the morning till 9:00 at night. The part in the middle, though, is where the city of the city owned that pool. We wouldn't have to do school background checks and all those are things we get have water aerobics programs which are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'really, you know, filling up in a lot of pools. We can have, as you say, lap school, lap swimming. It would be nice to try and think of it on the site that it is now with limited parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it also could be maybe the school district would consider one of their other properties since they want to build more football fields and track and soccer and everything else. But maybe there'd be a little bit bigger footprint that you could put a pool on with a plunge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Splash pool. I'm hoping that it still has water polo. I did water polo in that five foot pool. It's really hard to practice when you can't touch the bottom in a regulation pool. You sort of get fouled all the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I just really hope that we think outside the box on this. I think it's a wonderful thing that you're taking on and I hope it works. I'll be I'll be there helping.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Park. Okay. That's our only public speakers. So council discussion. So to look at what we're asked to do is we are asked to come up with some recommendations and these include short term options, appointing a working subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as Councilmember Vela mentioned, I think we spoke about this last time this came up, and I do believe the vice mayor and I were agreeable to being a subcommittee. I will just add that I learned to swim in this pool and I told my waters the story when she took me to to tour the pool that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was that kid who was terrified to let go of the edge of the pool because the waves in the pool, you know, those waves or the sharks or whatever, we're just going to come get me. And I had the most patient instructors through the Red Cross Swim to Live program who is very patient and work with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'me. And lo and behold, one day she got me to trust her enough to hold her and paddle. And I swam all through college and law school. That was my form of exercise. And and I believe that a city like Alameda, we're an island, all of our kids should learn to swim for their own safety, but also'",
        "'speaker_0': 'just for their own health and enjoyment. And it isn't just kids. It's one of those sports activities from cradle to grave. I mean, Councilmember Vela, you're going to be doing some little tiny, tight swim lessons, I bet you, before long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And for our seniors and everyone in between, as Dr. Parker said, I think it was Dr. Park, it's a low impact way to stay heart healthy and and exercise your muscles and and all those good things. So I think as a city, we can do better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm always a little chagrined when I'm in other cities and see these beautiful pools and think, Ooh, why not us? It's because of money. But I do believe we're ready to to move forward finding directions. So so the the long and short term options and I would say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But chime in folks when I call on you, it is probably we should consider everything on the table. I mean, I think with an eye toward keeping the pool open through May 2019 to get through the school year and then figure out what we're going to do to try to move forward with better swim facilities in Alameda'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I do understand that there's a short timeline because Ms. Wooldridge, when it's by May, the beginning of May 2019, there you are that we need to when you tell us when you need the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Early open until May 31st, it will be closed after May 31st.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you so okay. That's those are my thoughts. Chime in starting with okay counselor Avila. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so I was a swim kid. I learned to swim at Franklin Park, not at Emma Hood, but I was a swim kid and I grew up spending my summers going to the pool. And I used to give Dr. Parker the updates on my swim times, every orthodontics appointment that I had with him and I swam through'",
        "'speaker_8': 'college. I did club water polo, I taught swimming lessons, was a junior lifeguard, all of that stuff. And I think we are an island and we are a water community and there's a lot of families. I think those numbers aren't really full numbers because you have to think about all the families that are involved in addition to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those individuals that have signed up for the different classes or teams. Because the one thing about swimming is that it's it really is a family sport and your whole family goes and you spend the whole day there. And I think it's just a great opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I want to expand what we do for our kids and what we offer to our kids. It's a little bit selfish because I have a kid on the way, but I, I do want to make sure that there aren't you know, I think one of the hard things for me is that we're having swim lessons only'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in the summertime and we should be having an ability to offer swim lessons before the summertime so that when it's summer, we can have all of our kids enjoying our pools. So I'm fully ready to support the, the request to to have the subcommittee work and to work on all the short term things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we need to do it sooner rather than later so that we can buy time working with the county on what those fixes are. I think we need to get a handle on what the current expenses are for the current repairs and then identify kind of second tier repairs that could could happen in year, you know'",
        "'speaker_8': ', a year from now or six months from now and then and then even after that, because I think the long term goal, at least from my end, is I think we do need an indoor facility. I think that's what gets us year round swimming programs and water programs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm swimming right now. I'm pregnant. It's a great exercise for for when you're pregnant, there's a lot of things you can't do. But swimming is one of the things you can do. And I think it's also great exercise.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have grandparents who have used it, you know, aquatic programs as part of their physical therapy. They've had to travel in order to do that. I think we're doing a disservice to our aging community by not being able to offer those programs, and I think you need an indoor facility for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we need to look at multiple locations. But I also think that I would like to develop a five year plan or a four year plan because I think it's a long road to actually getting the funding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I would like us to have a more robust conversation about what those milestones are, where we can get the money for that, and how we can go about partnering with different private partners, community partners, the school district.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I also understand that the city is going to need to put funds into that. But I also think it's very worthwhile. And I think it's it's counted in the lives we save by making sure people are water safe, as well as having an opportunity to stay healthy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think oftentimes we we end up treating acute illnesses. You go to the hospital because you have heart disease or diabetes. And we need to really be thinking about lifestyle changes. And I think an indoor facility would do that and it would allow people to really participate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We could increase those numbers. I also want to make sure that when we look at the short term, we're looking at both pools because we do have a robust and growing water polo program. And I want to make sure that, you know, we have a number of other programs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need both of those pools. So I would want to make sure that the subcommittee is looking at the repairs to the decks, the the dove pool and also to the locker rooms. They're not to call out the locker rooms, but they're really bad.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and I think that that's the last thing you want to be thinking about when you're coming out of the pool is how gross the locker room is. I don't think we need to have a $43 million facility like Dublin, but I do think we need to think about a little more, a little bigger, a little more'",
        "'speaker_8': 'creative. I think splash pads are good things to get people, especially younger kids, comfortable with water. So I'm really open to all the suggestions, but I do want to have a report back so that we know from a counsel standpoint if there are going to be budget expenditures, that sort of things and we can plan on it'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I would also I also think that it's important to have the subcommittee and keep it small. But I do think we need to have a work session on this at some point. Perhaps the summer would be a good time to have it so that we can actually have a robust conversation about what this big vision might look'",
        "'speaker_8': 'like and then kind of refine it a little bit so that the subcommittee can stay focused and do the deep dove. And one other pun. You know, I know we're going to be busy keeping our head above water, but but I do I do think that it doesn't mean that we ignore the long term.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's why I would like to have kind of a five year plan. So I think it counts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyone gets one person per speaker. I see is one of mine. So that didn't count. And now just in the locker room, I was trying counsel before when when I did do the tour of the locker room, I walked in and it was like I never left it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It just pathetically it looks the way it did when I learned to swim. So we just go down the line. Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So and as one of the members of the school subcommittee, I think I was I'll just reflect for those who weren't at that meeting or many of you, especially in that corner, were, I think we're in a very unique place where the school district, the city and the community are all in the same place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We all agree that things are not good now. We all acknowledge that maybe we could have done better over the last ten years and that county health is now calling us on that. And I think we're now all committed to two to working together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I've been speaking with people in the swim community kind of about how we can move forward. I think this subcommittee is a really important way to do that. I think it's likely going to have to probably meet weekly or so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think just putting a standing item on the council agenda, because I don't think that the work of this subcommittee is for two members to go off and just do whatever they want. I think it's really for a way to get input from the council, from the full council every two weeks and move forward on what'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is going to have to be a really quick six week plan of action at the end of the six weeks. We're not going to know where the pool is going to be exactly. We're not going to know what the pool looks like, etc..'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we are going to need to know that the council and the school around the same place. And, you know, I guess I think if if there are concerns that that folks have right now around the idea of the city pass, I think something I'd like to look at is the city running the pool, taking over the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'pool, as it were, and building and building that pool. And so if I think if there are concerns about that, you know, now is a great time to time to talk about that. Yeah. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then before I go to Councilmember, decide something for the council to just think about. So as far as the two members of the public and I'm thinking it should be two rather than three, because then each entity is represented equally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would we just put it back out? To the pool users swim groups to designate their representatives. What do you think? Vice Mayor, you're a little closer to those groups.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So last last week, I, I met with members of just about every swim group together, including school sports masters, special ed club and club teams, parents, etc.. And the goal of that meeting was to start to help support them in organizing themselves to identify a leadership structure that that that can communicate among themselves and then identify some'",
        "'speaker_9': 'folks who could participate. I think that the right way to do that would be allow that group to identify a couple of people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I said. Okay, great. You'll keep in touch with them and can communicate back to your subcommittee member. Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much to HPD director Amy Warwick for her presentation and for the staff report. Very much and very much appreciated when the topic was brought before the School District City of Alameda Subcommittee, we meet regularly.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I found this topic to be very exciting, not just exciting in terms of, you know, trying to fix something that the Alameda High School is having to deal with. But exciting in the sense that I think this is something that's really a community, potentially a community wide benefit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So even though I am a member of the city council, a U.S. board subcommittee for purposes of this item, that I do think that the mayor of Alameda should be involved because this is going to be a signature citywide kind of project.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I so I think in the short term, we do need to move forward in terms of dealing with the county issues and to figure out, you know, how best we might deal with it. You know, the plastering issue that that director wore, Richard talked about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But also I think that the subcommittee that we come up with, we should also let them be in a position to kind of help us in the long term. So I would expect them to be participating in the long term visioning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My largest contribution to this right now would be to say that we really will need to involve the community in this because this is really a community wide project and it's something about which so many of us, whether on the West End or the East End, can be quite proud of and like in a similar way that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'many years ago, in 1955, Dr. Parker, who shared with us a photo of him as a youngster in the newspaper touting the 1955 1956 bond measure. Maybe there will be young youngsters today, the will who will also be touting this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we need to involve a lot of people in this. So I don't have much else to say, except I thank you very much, Director Woolridge, for your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I'm not going to add too much more than my colleagues have already added, except to say I mean, I agree that we should we should work on the the three items in the short term and the three items on the long term.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to, you know, hear back sooner rather than later on the cost estimate of of getting the repairs that county health thinks we can do at that's something we can do before May 31st in order to keep the pool open through the summer and not have to have any closures.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that would be be the better idea. I do agree that we do need to have a robust community process because I think we kind of fell down as a city on this, you know, eight years ago when everyone identified this as a problem and we took care of one and we didn't take care of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'other. And I think we knew this was going to happen. And the reason I asked the question about the budget is because, you know, we are in a period now and maybe it's ending. I'm not sure of, you know, we're going we're having excess reserves over what we what we agreed we should have in 25%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're having, you know, what I think are really significant surpluses of one time money. And I mean, to me, what better thing to do with one time money than to spend it on one time projects? And a new pool is a one time project.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'We better be damn sure we're giving them a new pool and we better not leave any ambiguity and we better not leave any wiggle room and any opportunity for anybody to welch out of that deal. So I think that's supercritical.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'A single box costs $7 without tax and comes with 36 pads. A single period would use 18 pads, which would mean that every two months you would need to buy another box. It costs $42 a year without tax to just buy pads.'",

I'd like to say that putting a tax on products women need as a direct consequence of their biology is fundamentally sexist and unjust. And in the tampon tax will help ensure that all people who need menstrual products can afford them.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Uh. Sorry. Uh. The first time I had to buy my own menstrual products was when my parents were out of town. They had only left me with a certain amount of money, and paying for these menstrual products cost over half of what they had left me.'",

My friends at Nicolosi Allison, who is here tonight, Sarah Scarth and I organized a period products drive for the existing legislation to end the tampon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We worked very hard and had some incredible conversations along the way. When I think about the possibility of AB 31 on a statewide level, I'm incredibly excited. I think about the many girls around the state of California who will no longer have to worry so intensely about affording necessary period products.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I especially think about the young.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tax on period products is necessary, but it is not sufficient. Those of us working to advocate for what we call menstrual equity call for safe, sustainable, convenient and affordable products in all schools, jails, shelters, and other public places like this building.'",

We also have our local issues to grapple with, including how to reflect our values in our city's budget and how to be the community of kind and loving people that we want to be.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I think the resolution there is three great points in the resolution, while many but three that leapt out at me. One is and it was raised by the speakers, a disparate, disproportionate negative impact on women, which largely impacts women in low income brackets for whom sales tax constitutes a larger proportion of their income.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And several states have already taken this step, including Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Jersey. I also think Ms.. Jordan just raised that. It's something I've read about lately. There is really shameful treatment of women prisoners in terms of making menstrual products available to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when all of you in political and proud out there as an ally want to take on yet another issue, look into that one. Just my suggestion. But anyway, any comments and then a motion because we we are waiting for our next item to so comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A vice mayor in Knoxville because you were the coauthor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So just quickly, I'm glad I didn't speak before the speakers because they couldn't have done a better job. So I just wanted to encourage our vote. One of the reasons I wanted to coauthor this is that allow me to just enacted its own five cent or a half cent sales tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, locally. And we have no control over what is taxed within that. Only through a 31 can we change that. But I think that we actually are in a place to to show leadership on something that we've actually our community has already taken action.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think it's important for us to show the way. So I think all of these fantastic people who have contributed to the resolution, that's before you written it and encouraged us to move it forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, just check in with the acting city attorney. You would agree, would you not, that this item has been sufficiently an agenda to consider approving a resolution of this work for AB 31 that we could take a vote tonight?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I would agree. Yes. Okay. Um.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman Brody, think you had some quick comments. Thank you. For all of the speakers that came out. You know, Rosemary, you've been emailing me for a while on this, so I'm glad that, you know this bill, hopefully this is the year it gets across the finish line.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, it's just a start. I mean, we do provide some of these products to low income students. But, you know, we need to provide these to all students. You know, we said apparently passed a resolution today, but yet we don't do anything in our restrooms in city hall, which I think is something we need to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'do. And, you know, you mentioned the impact on on low income families. And, you know, that's something that that that's the next step in this battle is to make sure that these products are provided to all low income families and people that do have, you know, federal aid are able to spend that money on these products.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, I think it's also important that we, you know, consider the disparate impacts on our LGBT families, because if you have two women in a family, you know, you're both, you know, family members are paying. So I think this is a great step and I appreciate and applaud the activism of these young ladies.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'This includes salary and benefits, but does not include long term powers increases. The direction I received from council last July was to come back full four fold with what we have for you tonight. Look at a fire marshal position that's fully paid by a fee increase.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Conductor fee increase on our fire prevention fees. Look at two new EMS fees for your consideration and also make some edification to our fire code analysis. That's what we're presenting for you tonight. I want to say that that figure of 355,000 does include, with all of our benefits, with all of our positions, doesn't include the current OPEB'",

Staff doesn't have the capacity to do it. We did internalize and study some of our fees we're going to propose tonight, but the fire prevention fees were all done by our consultant.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'We'll talk more about that. We also have fee changes that cover the full cost, as we talked about, of the fire marshal position and that we're going to propose to you to increase the division's entire division's cost recovery rate from its current 24% to 48%, starting very shortly to 59% in year four.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we'll talk about that. Also would like the authorization for my office to handle fee increase and code exceptions when you deal with the fire code. There's a number of exceptions that come up with different codes. And we're asking you for the authorization to have my office and the chief the chief officer assigned as a fire marshal'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to deal with those in the future. So we have again four recommendations for this tonight. Mayor and council adopt the proposed annual fire prevention fees as we discussed and the implementation schedule. Add one full time equivalent division chief to the Fire Prevention Staffing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Adopt the proposed new cost recovery fees, emergency medical services and vehicle accident cost recovery that we'll talk more about. Authorize the fire chief and my designee to administer the fee increase and code exceptions and modify the false warrant fee schedule from a six month rotation to annual based on all the other fees to be consistent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when you look at our fee charges right now, our current hourly rates averages about $105 an hour to conduct an inspection. That's all staff time, preparation, building code research, walking on premise. That's kind of our standard fee, and that was the basis for doing the study.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're proposing that beginning very shortly after your approval tonight, that that rate increase to $150 per hour, which would increase our collection rate overall to 48%, followed by another increase next fiscal year in 2021, $280 an hour increase in the collection percentage rate to 57%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then remaining kind of a just a cost neutral at that one year period for $180. Still maintaining 50% cost recovery. But then in 2022, 23, upping the fee to $200 to maintain a 59% cost recovery rate. Mayor, at your suggestion, when we met first to talk about this, you asked me to meet with our business community'",
        "'speaker_11': '. So myself and our deputy chief met with our Chamber of Commerce, Waba Dhaba, all the associations who have written letters of support saying that they were very nice, that we stopped by the we told them the fee structure proposals that we have before you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do have a smoothing out. We're increasing this over a four year period. It was very powerful to businesses and they were very thankful for that. So I believe the clerics provided you with that support letter also from the chamber.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Again, we talk about the full cost of the fire marshals, 355,000 to pay for that, we have kind of the rate proposal below you. We know how many billable hours of work we can do in a year with our current staff, with the proposed increase before you and the additional proposed increases in reinspection fees will more than'",
        "'speaker_11': 'cover the first year. Total compensation and benefits of the fire marshal positions we talked about. So we always want to look at how our fees compare to other East Bay communities. And again, with the first proposed increase of $150 an hour, if you look at the graph before you, you can see that we're still well below the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'medium of what most communities in the East Bay charge a high would be Hayward, which is and these are hourly rates. So here we're designing an $85 an hour, followed by Walnut Creek at 837, the lowest there is, obviously San Leandro at 120 currently and then plan reviews and both inspections.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We charge the same per hour. And because it's one hour staff time for those even after the the average they're excluding Alameda is $440 an hour so 150. When we show this to our business community there are gracious and obviously we're trying to recover more cost but obviously mindful of the cost to businesses and we want to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'be competitive in our region and I think still maintain that we do have that competitive service for you tonight. Even after the rates are all set at $200 an hour, we're still really well below what most East Bay cities charge for similar services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So again, as we move forward in that fourth year. So I want to talk about the two new fees before you, the proposed TMS cost recovery fee. Emir staff did a comprehensive three and five year time task in response time study to develop.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What does it cost us to provide service on an EMS call, a medical call? And is that is that amount fully cost recoverable? And there are some instances where it is and we'll talk about that tonight and ultimately ask for your approval of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when you look at what it costs to run in an emergency, obviously we look at the crew costs. We look at dispatch costs of supplies used. There's a vehicle excuse me, a vehicle involved. And we have the city's administrative rate, which fluctuates every year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we know now that a three person crew for an hour of time, which is our standard, including all benefits, including, again, OPEB in long term PERS, it's about $223 an hour. Our dispatch cost currently this year, it's about $42 per call.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We pay a flat rate every year, but if you break it down into a per call charge, it comes out to $42. We use an average of about $20 in medical supplies, gloves, I.V. supplies, bandages on a medical call.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our Cities City's having rate at that current rate is $50. So it gives us an accurate picture that it costs us about $380 to run a single EMS incident. So with that, that was our basis for developing the true cost recovery amount or factor to determine what those costs are and how we would propose moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when we look at our proposed EMS cost recovery and the process, what we're proposing to do is include this as a bundled charge within our ambulance transport invoice. We have a third party biller that can do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And even though we're building every patients that we transport, we will not collect those funds from every patient. And I'll kind of speak to that a little bit. Currently, right now, under state and federal law, only the private health insurers, Kaiser Blue Shield, Aetna, will pay a fire department for the first responder costs.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That makes up of our total patients transported about 19%. So we use that 19% factor in developing of 100% billing out. We're really only going to recover about 19% of the bills that are out there. What this does mirror and counsel that protects our elderly who are on Medicare primarily and are indigent, who are on Medi-Cal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Those two health care coverages do not pay for the first responder fees. So even though we include them with the bill, they're not going to provide us coverage or funding back for that. They both have pre-defined already agreed to amounts of reimbursement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's no haggling with Medicare Medi-Cal. We can send them a bill for any amount. They're still only going to give us X, Y, Z back for that transport. So again, this does not affect our elderly, our most vulnerable in our community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're really going after the dollars that the private health insurers have set aside for this and trying to collect that. Right now, we have close to 5000 billable EMS responses every year. That number grows every year. So our estimated annual cost recovery, again, of only the insured patients, is an additional revenue to the city of $332,000 per'",
        "'speaker_11': 'year. So we're proposing to enact that this evening before you. The next cost recovery that we'd ask you to consider. The saving, too, is for everyone that has general vehicle insurance. There is a small fee set aside within your insurance coverage that covers the event if you were to be involved in a vehicle accident.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And when you think about it, that makes sense. If you're involved in a vehicle accident, you're going to have a large response. More than likely, you may be injured, which would promulgate a response from the fire department or an ambulance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You may need medical transportation. You may be trapped. You may need the jaws of life extrication equipment. So there is a portion of your overall medical coverage that reimburses first responder agencies, ambulance companies, even police departments for the cost of providing that service.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mayor and Council. When we look at what it takes us to run a vehicle accident response, it's identical to the same time, the same crew size, the same response, the same dispatch costs. They're identical to what our EMS cost recovery fee is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the methodologies are identical. And when we look at the two fees, one, we're building health insurance companies. This one, we will actually build someone's auto insurance company. So we would collect what the auto insurance pays us. Right now, we average a five year study, about 200 vehicle accidents a year here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We don't have a very high volume. We don't have freeway systems. But that's that's a good average that we went with. And we estimate our annual cost recovery could be about $70,000 with that fee once instituted. So again, I want to give you a cost recovery comparison of what other East Bay communities are doing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's a number of them up and down the state, including those locally that have adopted EMS cost recovery fees. You can see the high would probably the Central Valley Fire District at just under $500. City Berkeley's about 425.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our proposed is 388. If you do an average of the fees, an average of about $383. So our fee cost recovery is is about the median of what most East Bay communities charge. Again, I can't speak to the studies that these other departments did, but I know that these are hard and fast and true costs for recovery'",
        "'speaker_11': 'that we can obviously stand by. Mm hmm. I want to talk, mayor and council about what the future of EMS cost recovery looks like, because I think it's important to understand from what your fire chief is looking at, not only locally, but statewide, but also what I ask my staff on a daily basis to look at.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So looking at this, we're going to see some significant changes from the Medicare health care program. When you look at the patients we transport, and this is true for almost every public agency that provides ambulance transportation like the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Medicare is always the number one provider of our insured dollars. As we grow older and we get on Medicare, that's what we tend to have the most health problems and the probable need for ambulance services. So it makes sense that the majority of our patients are over 65 and those are who we transport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So Medicare is looking to do a roll out next year. And this is a combination fee structure that's been developed and been in the process for a number of years by the Association of Fire Chiefs, International Association of Firefighters.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And really this was actually going to be implemented two years ago. But what stopped it was a simple nomenclature to the service. Medicare provides reimbursement to two types of entities a provider and a supplier. Right now for ambulance transport, we're considered a provider.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A provider has a designated cost that's non-negotiable. And it's a take it or leave it. So when we build Medicare, even though our average bill may be 2000, we're going to recoup about $627. That's just what Medicare pays.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They only pay for the base rate. They pay for the administration of oxygen and they pay us a nominal fee to transport per mile to a hospital. What this does now is make us a supplier of health care where we're now able to negotiate what our true costs are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, they're not going to take a makeup number, and we can't say it costs us $6 million for every transport or something like that, as you can imagine. But by adopting these fees and having done this study and knowing that our costs are 388 per call, I'll give you a snapshot of where these fees potentially could go'",
        "'speaker_11': '. So if you looked at the other slide, we proposed about 350 something thousand dollars as an average. You could see that almost doubling because this would pay us for a higher rate of reimbursement on top of transport. So you're looking at almost a quarter of three quarters of $1,000,000 of additional revenue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we're closely monitoring that. It looks like we're going to see a roll out of that in 2020. So as we know, we'll bring this back to you and certainly ask you to implement it because that's obviously less of a general fund impact that the fire department can contribute back for the services that we provide that are'",
        "'speaker_11': 'crucial to our community. One big thing I want to discuss that just came up this year that was actually stopped last year is if you look at the center of this slide, have initials called IGT. IGT stands for intergovernmental transfer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is a process where most counties and county hospital systems derive their additional funding through both Medicare and Medicare. Essentially, it pays them for costs that just like us as a provider of health care. We were only given so much back, but at the end of the day, we look at our true cost.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We send in an audit sheet and they provide us additional funding that is going to be made available to public transport agencies in California. I'm proud to say that that bill is an assembly bill is actually being sponsored, authored by Assemblymember Bonta.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we're very happy that Rob jumped on that as assisting us moving that forward. Now, what that does is right now we're in part of a program called the G EMT program. GMT is an acronym for Ground Emergency Medical Transport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That gives us annually about another $240,000 average over the last five years. That pays for additional transport costs for Medi-Cal patients. We're fortunate that we don't have a lot of Medi-Cal patients here in Alameda. We have a pretty good payer mix as opposed to more most cities in the East Bay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we do have a fair amount of Medi-Cal that additional revenue does help offset our costs. What this would do would take us out. This bill would take us out of that GMT program and put us into an IGT program.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if we look at right now, Medicare pays us about $357 per transport on the formula here. That makes up about half of our transports, which are about 2000 average per year, and that's the cost of our transport.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our loss per transport is 1600 dollars. 1643 IGT would cover that loss in addition to what we originally received, so we could look at potentially another $3.3 million in revenue to the city starting in 2020, maybe early 2021.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'll give you an idea. Statewide, the GMT program right now reimburses public agencies. It's about 105 to $110 million program. Switching to an IGT would make that statewide a $1.5 billion program. So you can see the significant amount of additional potential revenue down the road.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we're fortunate that we are a transport history. We have tours and rights to that. We certainly have your supported council to continue that. But I think you see there's a significant amount of future revenue associated with that that we'll keep our eye on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And as soon as we can definitely catch that, we'll bring it back to council for your edification and ultimate support and review. So I wanted to give you kind of where we're looking at what the future of EMS cost recovery.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think you'll see that by knowing what our fees are today, by having done this study on what our true costs are to respond. We're well set up to be that supplier of health care because we've done the study and we can quantify what it costs us to go to a medical call.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we're probably much more positioned in many communities to to be at the forefront of collecting those additional reimbursements in the future. Mayor and council. With that again, I'll leave you with our recommendations tonight for your hopeful support.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're asking that you implement the proposed fire prevention fees incrementally over the next four years. We, as we proposed, add one full time division fire chief marshal position to the Fire Prevention Bureau, implement the two new cost recovery fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I spoke about EMS and vehicle action cost recovery authorize the fire chief on the code exceptions we talked earlier and make it a small change in our fee schedule to reflect that we monitor fire false alarms going from a six month rotation to an annual rotation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you look at how the fee structures are laid out before you council, you'll know that, yes, we don't know what future long term PERS increases are OPEB liabilities, but we have some natural increases to the hourly rates that continue to build that cost recovery factor and add additional revenue over that four year period.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In addition, in your resolution, we also can enact a you're at your approval cost of living increases if our costs accelerate beyond that. So what I'm specifying to you this evening is we're always going to keep those cost recovery numbers at the same and ensure that the addition of the fire marshal position has no impact in the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'future to the general fund. So with that Mayor Council, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have or the public council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have any clarifying questions about this staff report? Not this time. I think they have a couple. See here, Chief Rodriguez, the on page three of my my staff report. This is the section that says phe study results.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you there? Okay. So in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Uh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In the second paragraph, it says the fire department staff recommends recovering additional costs in phases over the course of a four year period. The second sentence is what I wanted to ask about where individual current fees are recovering greater than 100% of the calculated full cost outcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These fees are recommended to be reduced to no more than 100% cost recovery. So my question is, which fees are those?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There was a few fees in our overall fees which are attached to this report that actually were probably calculated at a higher rate. In the past, above what our current costs are. So under the state law of cost recovery, we can recover our costs, but only up to what our costs are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So call off hand.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Which I can't recall offhand. I know there is only just a handful of them, just some small things that, you know are probably fees we hardly ever charge. But to be consistent with state law. Yeah, she measures in mind there's probably like four small ones that were captured in there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. Offhand. I apologize. I don't remember what they were, but the majority of our fees did go up significantly with that increase that we proposed because we do have a number of fees in there. If you look at the overall fee index.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did, but I did always catches my attention when it says that some fees will be reduced. And I'm sure the business you're interested to. And by the way, you were very well received by all you and Deputy Chief John Beck were well received by the business associations because I heard back from them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you for doing that at my request. Thank you. Another question I have on page four, this has two tables to provide a comparison of the recommended city of Alameda. It it's the second table, the recommended city of Alameda Fire Department fees staff provides the below table of similar communities and their associated fee structures.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm still trying to figure out Hayward, but I'll ask one of my friends on the Hayward Council about that another time, Walnut Creek. I kind of get that. But Fremont, can you help me understand why is Fremont's inspection hourly rate $192 in their plan review?'",
        "'speaker_0': '$95? If you know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As my understanding with Fremont, because they had Fremont went through an incredible growth spurt probably in the last ten years, I think their council made a decision to keep their fees as low as possible. So that reflects in what they're actually charging you as a council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Set the policy on what you want to collect, what percentage. So the proposals before you without you giving staff direction. I spent a lot of time with our finance director and our city manager. And if you read the NBC study, if we were to do a 100% cost recovery for fire prevention, our average hourly rate would be'",
        "'speaker_11': '$300 an hour. I think that's a little egregious. If we were to inspect a barbershop, a small hair salon, you know, $300, that's a pretty high fee. And if you look at like Hayward of Walnut Creek, they made the decision, no, we're going to recover 100% of our cost.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's the council direction in those communities. The manager and I felt that and the business community was very supportive of it. If we kind of quantitative the fees at a nominal increase the first year, a nominal increase, the second year kind of a reprieve period, and then another increase to get it up to $200 an hour and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'not the 300 we're doing. We're obviously recovering the fire marshal costs totally, but we're also taking away from the general fund its fuller impact instead of the general fund paying 100% of the total cost of fire prevention bureau in the fourth year, they would pay the fees would recover 59%.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the general fund would be reduced liability down to 41%. We felt that that was a more kind of smoothing, an easy way to implement these fees. We recognize that costs will accelerate and go up in the future and we have those automatic increases in there to deal with those if we need to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think that gives you a little background on Fremont, some of the other cities. It's really the council's decision. Do you want to if you want us to charge $300 an hour as mayor and that's your wish this evening, we'll certainly comply with that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I think after speaking with our business community, they were very supportive of how we said thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think I heard myself say that, but I was just questioning if you knew and perhaps you don't. But that's interesting. So that Fremont might have decided not to burden their development community with fees. Then the other question I wanted to ask you is that the top of my page five, which talks about maybe it's um'",
        "'speaker_0': ', somewhere I guess is just a footnote that as far as the billing for these fees that Berkeley city of Berkeley pro rates their fee by the the quarter hour. Is there some thought to doing that for Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I believe we included in the master fee schedule both a quarter and half hour.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Increments to match that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if you went, say, by four waiting by the quarter hour, but that changed the revenue assumptions that the billing structure is based on. You know, if you're not, any visit that you walk into is going to be minimum of one hour charge, but instead it's decided to be one quarter hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there don't we have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To know if you actually look at if you actually look at the master fee schedule, mayor, it'll say we'll give you example, pick a supermarket, it'll say the occupancy type in the square footage. It already has pre-established how long it takes us so that one could be a 2 to 2 and a half hour.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the hourly rates and the inspection cost would be based on that amount of time. A barbershop very small. The. You only have a few things to look at. Maybe an hour and maybe half an hour. So it gives us flexibility in the actual fee study or the fee lines now to do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So but it doesn't impact the overall fee, the fee amounts, if you look in the table of our step stepped cost recovery are extremely conservative. We only looked at revenue in the future from one source that the Fire Prevention Bureau does, and that's mercantile inspections, business inspections.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There will be an incredible amount more of revenue because we also do residential inspections, apartment buildings, anything more than three units. We also do code enforcement and code compliance, which has its own set of revenue sources. And we also do reinspection fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I really can't tell you, and I wish that every business didn't need a re-inspection. But as you go through more inspections and some businesses are more problematic than others, the reinspection costs go up considerably, too. So we can kind of quantify and maybe give an estimate to those.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the numbers you see here are very conservative. So I'm going to I'm going to say to council that we're trying to obviously under-promise and overdeliver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember Desai. Thank you, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Now, currently, is it correct that any kind of fire prevention or any kind of services that are being offered that are similar to what what's contemplated under tonight's discussion? Is it correct that we're doing it through non sworn fire personnel?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No. The current staffing in the bureau is three personnel currently. All three are sworn. We do have one civilian inspection person. That's our senior code compliance officer. That's been vacant for some time. That is a non sworn position.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Unfortunately, we're going out for the fourth time to try and recruit a replacement for that. But we it's been vacant for some time and we're having extreme difficulties trying to recruit the civilian position for that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Is it correct to say that there was a point in time when it was done by non sworn personnel?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No. If you go back to when the bureau was shuttered in 2009, there was a staff of seven there and five of the seven were sworn positions, two were non sworn and it dropped out. Actually the one non sworn position that recently retired that we have to fill and council made a decision back, I believe in May'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of 17 to bring a smaller version of the Bureau back and that included the three non three sworn positions that I spoke of earlier.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And do other CIT, do other cities do use non sworn or is the majority use sworn? What's the mix?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It really depends on the city. If I had to take a pulse of comparable agencies, most agencies use sworn primarily for a couple of reasons. Non sworn fire inspectors. The positions generally don't pay very well and there's no chance for promotion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they're considered kind of a dead end job. Most people take them to get some experience to go on and to become a firefighter or some other, you know, public safety professional. So we're finding that now with trying to recruit the sworn, the non sworn position that we lost.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So most of my fire chief friends that I talked to are going if they do have non sworn as non sworn leave, they're replacing them with sworn because they just can't get non sworn because we can't maintain a salary that's competitive.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And obviously people know going into it there's no chance for promotion. It's pretty much, I hate to say it, it's pretty much regarded as a dead end job.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And final question, the discussion regarding the extent to which we utilize non sworn versus sworn. Is it correct to say that that was a council discussion that occurred robustly in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'From my from my information on the history of it? Yes. I think there was quite a bit of discussion on sworn versus non sworn and looking at everything. And I think I think options were presented on both.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Counselor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Over.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Just a question of the city attorney. I mean, that's not an issue that we're allowed to be really discussing today, right? The issue of sworn versus non sworn. It's not on the agenda. It's not in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I just want to I don't want to get shut up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you can probably if it relates to the fee study, if it relates to, you know, establishing the amount of the fees, then it would be something that would be appropriate for discussion point made.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Chief, thanks for that presentation. I just wanted to ask a few questions on the fire marshal position so we don't have that position today, right?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So who's who's doing that job?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Primarily myself and what little staff we do have assigned to the Fire Prevention Division currently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what things? I mean, you only have limited number of hours in the week, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So by having you do that and not having a full time fire marshal, I mean, what are we what are we losing? I mean, what are we not getting? What things are going undone?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, if you look at the staff report and again, I don't want to hear what page it is because my pages are different. We really talk about the duties of a fire marshal and that's also what's really not getting done there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Bullet points I should at the bottom of my page three, it may be different than yours. That's really what's not getting done. We don't have the daily management and oversight of that division. It's the only division that doesn't have daily management and oversight in the form of a chief officer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Every other division does. Prior to 2009, we had a full time fire marshal that was a chief officer. And most communities, with rare exception, have a full time fire marshal, i.e. chief officer assigned. The fire marshal is critical and it's going to be more critical in the very near future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As this counsel knows, there's an incredible amount of pent up development on the island that's about to occur and we're trying to balance keeping new construction moving and also the existing problems in buildings today. The city manager and I have come up with some contingency plans.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if the fire marshal position doesn't get approved, well, I'm going to have to step back as fire chief and really make a decision on what we can do moving forward. And something has to give and I have to have a more higher priority with the existing buildings because people are in them.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have existing life support. Issues. Whereas a building that's being built is no hazard today because it's not being constructed. So it's imperative, you know, to keep our community moving forward. This is a mission critical position, and I probably said that in my report several times.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So hopefully that answers your question, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And by you doing double duty and only getting paid one one for one job, I mean, what duties of yours are are we potentially sacrificing by you continuing to be the fire marshal?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, I think my staff would probably say they're hopeful that we get a fire marshal because I have to rely on them more. And there's a lot of things we're not getting done. We have an incredible recruit issue we have to deal with coming up because of our vacancies.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have succession planning. We have new company officers, new chief officers. I wish I had one on one time for the succession planning and mentoring. I can't find the time. And that's one of the things. And to me, those are incredibly important because we need to build our next future leaders.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Summer in this room today, and that's imperative. And that's my job. But I can't find time to do that. So that does suffer greatly. And it's sad that it does.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And you mentioned the development. I talked to Andrew Thomas, and I think the number he gave me was between 29, 49 and 30, 49 in the pipeline. I mean, what happens to those if we don't have a robust.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm going to have I'm going to have to make some hard decisions that the there's going to be significant delays in getting development off and up and running and construction. No development can proceed without the review of built in fire protection systems.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the lot plans, access points, fire hydrants on scene, on location, etc. There's a lot of different things that building and fire prevention work hand in hand on to make sure building safe building could be occupied and that without the two working cohesively, things get bogged down.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Things will all slow down considerably.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this is a chief position, not irf 689 position. Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I know this, this position would be part of our chief officer bargaining group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So not 689. Correct. Okay. And then should I forget the last question? But I think you've answered my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So just a quick question on the issue of if that there is there's a risk of development projects getting slowed down, but even if development projects get slowed down, is it correct to say that the end result is still an evaluation as to the fire readiness of of whatever project?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So whether you do it under the current proposed scenario or you do it under the what we're doing right now. It's just that one's going to happen faster. But at the end of the day, both are going to have a sign off as to something as to whether a project is fire ready or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not that easy to answer in that fashion. Councilmember de Saag. It really has to do with the project and the time management of existing people. One thing Council has to understand is when we initiated the Fire Prevention Bureau almost two years ago now, all those personnel needed training and significant training to get up to speed, to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'be able to do inspections legally, site people legally for code violations, but also to do some basic plan reviews and checks. The overall signing off of a development is really between the office of the Fire Marshal, meaning me now and the building official.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it really boils down to a time management thing. I'm not here to make an envelope threat of a work stoppage or anything that to the council. I'm just trying to edify for the council that this position is critical.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we want to support development. We want to support an expanded housing stock for our residents. We obviously want to support more economic development for for us as a community. But we've got to have the people in place and the tools needed for that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This should have had a fire marshal assigned to it two years ago. Tonight, I'm before you because I was asked to come back from this past July and do two more things. One, do a few study to look at our fees and increase them as needed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's before you, but also pay for the position. So tonight I'm coming to you with a fully paid position with no impact to our general fund. And we're getting the benefit of having no future work stoppages and no issues with continuing providing great service that ultimately I believe our community deserves.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any further clarifying questions before we go to our public speakers? Okay. Seeing that I've got two public speakers, the first is Paul Muller and the second is Edward Hirschberg. And you'll each have 3 minutes to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Mueller.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry. Been sitting for a while. A little stiff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me too.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I know. I feel for you. Mayor Ashcroft. City Council members. Community. I'm an Alameda resident. I mean, Alameda business owner. I am a. Business Transactions attorney with an office over in Mariner Square. My wife shares our office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She's an educational therapist. She also lives and work there in Alameda in 2007.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Mueller, to be sure, you're directing. Oh, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry. In 2017, a fire inspector came to our 800 square foot office for three offices and a meeting, you know, an entry area. He was very nice, introduced himself, looked around, poked his head into each of our offices, said everything, looked fine and walked out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He about two weeks later, we then got a bill for his inspection and the bill was $402 a one hour minimum charge. So my request, I find that unacceptable. So whatever the business community meetings have had with the fire chief and I certainly, you know, respect that and understand that for me, $102 charge for what was essentially'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a five minute inspection works out to 1200 dollars an hour. I build by the hour, I don't know, 1200 dollars an hour. And I have 40 years experience as an attorney. My wife bills by the hour. She's a well respected educational therapist.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She doesn't bill 1200 dollars an hour. So my request is that if you approve these fees and I certainly don't see any reason why you shouldn't, that you also direct the fire department to bill in some increments. That's less than an hour.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It does not take an hour to review my office. The gentleman was there for 5 minutes max, so actually that's it. My request is, is that if you approve the fees, that you also approve or require a request that the fire department do it in increments of less than a full hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. I'm Evan Herzberg.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of City Council. I'd like to discuss the issue we had last year. The fire inspector came through our building over in Oak Street and in the space of an hour, went through ten or more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Officers building $102 for each and $102 for us for inspecting the building. Coming out to a bit over $1,000 for an hour's worth of work. We had an office building full of angry tenants.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On our hands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I made an appointment and I met with the fire chief and he says, Well, this is out of my hands. You need to take it up with the city council. So that's why I'm here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't believe that it's fair to build.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More than one person for the same man hour. If I did it in my.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Business, I'd lose my license and probably be sued for fraud. So I think you need to you need to start building in increments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not be building two people at the same time. And when you have an office building, why is it sliced and diced into individual offices for building? Why not simply build look at the entire building as a whole, as one business in two, 3 hours max.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Fire inspector could inspect the entire building and issue a bill for it rather than.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If they go to their current fee schedule.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And their current way of doing it. It's going to cost $10,000 to inspect the building, which is entirely unreasonable. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. We have no further public comments, so we will close public comment. Councilmember Ody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So just a couple of quick comments on this item. You know, I think for people's memories, if they if they don't remember the impetus for this, this was when we had the ghost ship fire over in Oakland and some 30 odd folks died because the place was not inspected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And even if it would have been inspected, you know, it wasn't it wouldn't have been inspected with people that really have knowledge of, you know, egress and ingress and, you know, all of those things that it's important that that a fire person, you know, has knowledge of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So last year we had this discussion during the budget and we decided to bring it back. And I think Deputy Deputy Chief Ziemba came back. And then I think you and I had a chicken and egg discussion about, you know, should we do that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we have to do the approval of the position before we approve the cost study? And now we're here today? So I appreciate that you were able to get this done and brought back to us in a timely manner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I could sit here and discuss about, you know, the benefits of, you know, having a fire marshal versus not having a fire marshal. The the impact on the chief's work life balance. I mean, the impact on the 2900 homes that we are trying to build to meet the housing crisis that could be delayed if we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'don't fully fund this position, which, by the way, is really paid for. So I thank you for bringing that that back to us. But I think I want to talk about, you know, basic values and basic values of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what I see my position here as a city councilmember is to provide basic services to our city. And to me, those services, our police and fire, you know, and to a lesser extent, you know, public works. So while I I don't think that, you know, we should be charging people to provide those basic services because that's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'part of our our duty. But be that as it may, I appreciate that our chief has taken out taking a hard look at this and find ways where our our fire department can be more than just a cost center, that it can actually be a revenue generator.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that $4 million that you found, I mean, that's the equivalent of 80% of our sales tax that we just passed. So I appreciate that and I appreciate the work of our police chief also to try to find grant money to do what I think our core basic services because I don't want to get to a position'",
        "'speaker_5': 'where somebody doesn't pick up the phone and call 911 because they think they're going to get billed for, you know, getting robbed or get billed for, you know, their house being on fire. We get billed because the power line is down or bill because a water main broke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, I mean, that's my basic philosophy. But, you know, I appreciate that you've done this and we've asked you to do this and find a way to fund this position. I appreciate that. And I really want to commend our safety chiefs for, you know, what they do sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's it's disappointing to me that, you know, whenever safety, especially fire, asks for something that improves the safety and protects the lives of our citizens, which is your sworn obligation and you do it well, that is generate so much controversy and it shouldn't, because that is our number one priority as council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our number one priority as the city is to keep our people safe. It's to make sure that people live here, know that they're free from crime, and they know if they get sick and they know that their house is on fire, that we're going to take care of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because if we don't, our. Property values plummet. And then it doesn't really matter about infrastructure, it doesn't really matter about schools, it doesn't really matter about public works because we won't have any of that because we won't have a high property tax base.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, again, I don't think I think what's lost here is that our chiefs are charged with protecting our citizens and our fire chief. And those that came before him have made us a Class one fire department. I don't know if people understand what that is, but I think we're one of the only, if not the only class'",
        "'speaker_5': 'one fire department here in the Bay Area. I think there's maybe 18 statewide and like about 200 now nationwide. So what does that mean for us? I mean, if you look at your bottom line, you know, it means your fire insurance is going to be less.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everyone loves that. So I think that's a good thing. But what it really means for everyone's day to day lives is that if you pick up the phone and you call 911 and your grandmother is having a stroke, that somebody is going to be there, somebody is going to be there quickly, and they're going to be able'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to take care of her and get her to the hospital. If your kid is choking or having a breathing problem that a fireman and a fire woman are going to get there and they're going to take care of your kid.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's what that means. That means if your husband or wife is sick. That a fireman and a fire woman are going to get there and take care of that person. And those are the things that our firemen and our fire women and our fire chief and our fire management are fighting for every day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not political is to make sure that our people that live here are safe. And that is our number one priority. And as long as I am sitting here, that is going to be my number one priority. I am honored to vote for all of these things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's a great thing that you're doing, Chief, and I applaud you for finding ways to find more ways to raise money and find ways to pay for these services. But at the bottom line, to me, this is a core service that we need to be providing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I applaud you for bringing it forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Actually, Councilmember Vela had her hand up a little earlier. She had some, I think, unanswered questions. Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there were a couple questions that got raised by the speakers and and Chief, actually, I don't know if these questions some of them might be for you and some of them might be for our city manager or our interim city manager, but for building and our building and planning department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do you know what increments we build for them? Do we?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry. I do not. As the chief said in this study, they are broken down into quarter and half hour and one hour increments. But sometimes on these types of inspections, I should leave that to the chief. And it's customary here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that a a building or an office is charged, an individual inspection, if it has an individual business license. So you may have an office building that has a dozen offices in it, and each one of those would be filled individually.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The firefighter or the code enforcement officer comes there and then they have to go back and they've got to do paperwork. So it's just not time on scene. It's time completing the necessary documents and then the filing and the clerk portion of it and the bookkeeping portion of it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that's so so to clarify, Chief, there might be the individual face time of the inspection itself, and then there's additional there's additional paperwork on the back end and ahead of time in terms of scheduling or how does that work?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. When NBC met with our staff, we looked at every possible occupancy that would need to be inspected. How much time it takes. Looking at travel time, preparation, reading the code, doing a reference check on the business, the history of that business.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As Mr. Reid had alluded to, there's also travel time back. There's an incredible amount of paperwork to make sure they're safe. There's a we now that we bill, we have those building costs built in. We have clerical support, there's vehicles, radios, etc., etc., all go in and to make it up that cost to the two speakers that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I haven't talked to personally but have dealt with on correspondence. We do now have the mechanism before you for small businesses to look at a half hour raid or if we're there for an hour and a quarter, we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Whereas the passed fee schedule, we did not have that option. So that's one thing that we did built in because, you know, we want to be cognizant of our community and we want to be fair and certainly provide a good service, but a service that's meaningful and meant and obviously responsible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then my second question, Chief, is and this was briefly touched upon, but for for an individual building. So that would be if there's different sub tenants or different sub businesses or business license holders within a singular building, they would each have to have their own inspection.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct. It really depends on not so much their business license, but the type of occupancy that they are. Every business is expectable under the fire code. Some are mandated, some aren't. So we really try and do the ones that have the most risk to a life first and then kind of work backwards from there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How often are they inspected?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It really depends. We're trying to get to an annual inspection rotation, but with limited staff it's been difficult. I don't know the exact amounts, but you know, the ones that are state mandated, like a care facility for the elderly, those type of things, we do those annually, but the rest we have to really just kind of stagger'",
        "'speaker_11': 'based on the personnel needs that we have assigned.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So like a law office or an office for an insurance company or somebody who sells insurance or something like that, they they wouldn't have an annual inspection requirement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They would under the code. It's really up to us to we have that time management capacity to do that. Okay. So and it's a yes and no answer. I wish I had more info for you, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I did so since this also is council discussion. Thank you, chief. Those questions and I and I do appreciate the thorough report and especially the follow up. I know we had a lot of questions in our work session that we had and it required a lot of work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I appreciate that. I do work in my day job in the city of Fremont. And there was a question raised earlier about Fremont, and they actually just published their fiscal year 2018, 2019, proposed operating budget and budget updates.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I have already reviewed them because I have to go there for a meeting next week. But so for the city of Fremont, they do a little a couple of things a little differently. First of all, they have they maintain a general fund primary reserve of 15%.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And when you count the budget uncertainty reserve, it goes to 16.8%. It's significantly different from how we try to keep our general fund, and I want to keep it that way. And the other thing is, is that they have significant so they're a population of about a quarter million and they have significant revenue sources from property tax'",
        "'speaker_8': ', about $92 million. This past fiscal year, it's projected to go up another 6 to 7% to about 97.5 million. And then sales tax, which they're on track for, and sales tax is about 51 million. A year and it's projected actually to go up to 7.1% and that's on track to about 55 million.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the question for me is, you know, and really the question before the council is how much do we want to subsidize these fees? And we've been heavily subsidizing them essentially by not really charging the the kind of the actual for the for the actual time involved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that has meant that we don't have the personnel involved. And Councilmember Odie alluded to this whole chicken and the egg conversation, and we spent a lot of time at the work session kind of figuring out why can't we charge the fees and then fill the position?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And part of it is the state of California says you can't just charge the fees without actually having the position and filling it. So you have to you have to create the position in order to charge the fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then you actually have to work at filling the position and making sure that we're actually out doing that work. And I guess the question is, how much do we want to subsidize this? I think there is no doubt in my mind that we have to get this work done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's part of helping Alameda kind of continue to move forward with some of these things that we have lined up. And I certainly don't want to change how we go about. I think the failure has been that we've said we are going to subsidize it and then we actually don't plan for the position and then the work'",
        "'speaker_8': 'doesn't get done. So I don't think that that system has actually worked for us. And I think if we actually did start subsidizing it with general fund money, then where does the money come from? And I want to continue to be, you know, doing what we're doing to do these set asides with our general fund.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I do think that really for me, the compromise is this kind of fee structure that's gradual and that is, you know, looking at increments of time that are smaller than what's existed, which is what one of the speaker's concerns were.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're not trying to overbuild. We're not trying to price gouge, but we are trying to cover costs. And I think that that's the responsible thing to do. And we do this occasionally where we have to adjust our fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did it last year with the parks. So so, you know, in light of that, I'm happy to hear from my colleagues. But for those reasons, I'm supportive of making sure that we create these positions and get the work done and and actually collect the fees for the work that we're doing, which we have not been doing'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. And councilmember members like you had your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I believe that the role of the city council is to provide basic services in a cost effective manner. And I think the reason why we are striving to increase fees in an effort to recover costs is because the underlying workforce that's delivering this service, it's the cost is quite high.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the reality, though, is that unfortunately, the conversation about whether or not to have non sworn persons do the fire prevention type of building inspection type of activities, that conversation between having non sworn or sworn is a conversation that happened in 2017 and as a result the fire chief is following through on the directions there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So he cannot be he or his staff cannot be deemed for that. But I did run in 2018 looking to non sworn to provide the fire prevention services, the building inspections. And and so that was a point that I had raised with the public in the run up to November 2018.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I recognize that, you know, that that we are not going to revisit that. But that's also a truth that, you know, I had conveyed a perspective that I had conveyed to the public. And so I will be hard pressed to support this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I also recognize though that if we go with the non sworn civilian, had we had we done that. I also recognize that there might be some downsides and the downsides might be, you know, for example, delayed in development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But at the end of the day and that was the question I was getting at the end of the day, whosoever provides the service, we have to believe that at the end of the day, whether it takes, you know, three weeks to complete tasks or whether it takes six weeks to complete tasks, at the end of the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'time that the service that will have been rendered is an evaluation as to whether or not a business or a property that's being developed is fire, preventive, safe? So from my perspective, I'm willing to go with that tradeoff of having delayed development with non sworn.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I recognize though that that was a conversation that really happened in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm going to go next. Thank you. And also, I did note to the clerk that I thought I was having time saved after clerk every time I called on speakers. And that is not the intent. So stop doing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please give me a little extra time, but I'll try to talk fast. Thank you, Chief Rodriguez. Good, thorough report. And and also Deputy Chief is on back who was kind enough to meet with me last week and answer my Brazilian questions on this particular item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I asked the interim city manager, Mr. Ruda, not to bring the authorization for the $355,000 fire marshal position and the $70,000 vehicle request to the Council. At this particular point in time, I explained that we are two months away from budget hearings and we also have a new city manager coming in about six weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But every other department in this city is currently preparing their requests for increased staffing expenditures and so forth. For the budget process, it is more prudent to consider all budget requests at the same time to give the Council and also the public a more realistic view of city finances.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Rouda told me that to not fill this position now would delay development projects and construction of new residential housing. So I'm always one who likes to do my homework. I reached out to Andrew Thomas, our planning director, and Greg McFadden, our city building official, and asked them, Have you run into delays in our our development?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'New development, new residential. And they both looked at me and said, what? No. And Mr. McFadden even checked with all his business building inspectors. And that isn't happening. I mean, I love hearing the number of 2949 housing units in the pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should be so lucky to see these in the next decade. I mean, we just broke ground yesterday on the first residential development at Alameda Point. It's 66 oh, senior affordable apartments. That's wonderful. My point is, in California, for many reasons, residential development, commercial development is just not happening fast and furiously.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do have concerns that this funding, funding this position with inspection fees, fee increases and other fees is a risky proposition, given that we have to anticipate an economic downturn sometime in our future, which could result in businesses closing or leaving Alameda and therefore reducing the amount of inspection fee revenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And indeed, the last time there was a Fire Protection Bureau and it got closed down, it was in during the downturn in the economy 2008, 2009. We also know, and it's my duty as an elected official to deal with this we have a growing pension and OPEB liability that we must address because I want all of you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'folks in the front rows to have your pensions in your retirement because you have earned them. You have worked hard, you have risked your lives. But I can't do that if this city doesn't stay solvent. And we don't have to look too far from Alameda to see examples where cities went bankrupt and the obligations to the retirees'",
        "'speaker_0': 'could not be met. I take that extremely seriously. We have also identified more than $300 million in infrastructure needs in our city, and that was a year ago when we were looking at but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Didn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Manage to put an infrastructure bond on the the ballot to take to the voters. And I would just add that it didn't include a swimming pool at that time. And so those needs still exist with no funding source, better general fund to pay for them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to keep that in mind. Of course, I want our city to be safe for those who live, work and play here. And in 2017, shortly after the tragic ghost ship fire in Oakland, at my request, I met with then fire chief Doug Long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wanted to know how many uninspected buildings do we have in my city? And he gave me a printout of over 3000 commercial buildings that were overdue for annual fire inspections, some going back as long as 25. Based on that information and his insistence that only sworn firefighters could adequately staff this bureau, I voted for those sworn'",
        "'speaker_0': 'positions. Later, I learned that many other fire departments in Oakland is one of them staff their fire protection bureaus with civilian personnel, but at the head they use sworn personnel. Chief Rodriguez was unable at short notice to provide me with an updated version of this inspection list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I would like to know what has the Fire Protection Bureau accomplished in the comparison of when I saw the list in 2017 until now, with the sworn positions that we did at Metrics are important. Recently, this Council voted to approve funding from the General Fund for the Community Peer Medicine Program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was to be a one third, one third, one third split with Alameda County Emergency Services, Alameda Hospital and the city. But last week, when I met with the chief operating officer of the county health systems and said, So when can we expect our money?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He said, No, we turned down that request. We didn't see that it was that much of a cost savings to the hospital. So right now the city is burying two thirds instead of one third of the cost, a little over $200,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyway, to wrap up, it is crucial for the Council to consider actions that further burden our general fund very carefully and logically. I reiterate my request that the approval of this Fire Marshal position for an annual cost of $355,000 and the purchase of a vehicle for $70,000 be considered during the upcoming budget workshops rather than this evening'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I am fully supportive of the fee increase and I would say we don't have to create the positions to justify the fee increases. We have to show the nexus to the activity. And I think the chief and the folks who put the report together did a very good job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think as a council, we have a greater responsibility to look out for the the good of the entire city, which is made up of many valuable departments. Thank you OC Vice Mayor, we haven't heard from you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. So I'd like to thank. Chief Rodriguez, budget director there, and the city manager for spending a lot of time talking to me, asking, answering a lot of questions. I am thankful and supportive of the fee structure that that has been a lot of feedback here that's been proposed tonight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I do have one issue that I would like to address as we as we approve this. And it's that when you look at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Florida and you don't think you're fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just don't get points because maybe. They'll turn you down. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry. We're good. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When you look at the cost recovery chart, it assumes that there's no increase in the actual expenditures of this program over the four years, despite the fact that we know the contracts are going to are going to increase cost of living increases every single year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so in approving this, I'm going to ask that we approved this in $2,018 with an expectation that every year this fee is increased, according to the COLA for the state, for the staff covered by the memo use that provide these services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In that way we will make sure that the that the 59% actually is covering the costs that in 2019 it is covering. If you actually adjust and look at it, it actually, under the current proposal would actually have a general general fund impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When I spoke to Chief Long Chief Rodriguez in January about the fact that this issue would be coming forward, because I had heard it discussed at the workshop last spring and again during the budget, and as has been mentioned by many people, a number of people beginning in 2017, I did ask the question about why is this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'coming ahead of the budget? And the response was, since it doesn't, since it will have a net zero impact on the general fund, it would be and it had been asked for for two years that they would like to move it forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I told him at that point in time that as long as they could bring forward something that provided a needed service, that had a net zero impact on the general fund, that I would be open to supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So tonight, I think if we can if we can approve the approve the cost recovery fee schedule, which includes the cost for this position, along with the position which I would like to condition, will be cost neutral over its lifetime.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So as this goes forward, if the costs go up for this position, we will need to make sure that it is recovering those costs. This costs, this disposition as it has happened in 2008 and other times can be removed if necessary if we are in budget issues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I would like would like to see it as a cost neutral because we are proposing it outside of the budget. If at some point in time we want to put it into the budget and have it be a budgeted general fund costs, I am open to that, but that should be done during the budget.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additionally, I would like to have a report, a six month report on the both the billing and collection of fees. In speaking to the Chief, it is my understanding that the $499,000 in fees that we are estimating in revenues is not the amount we're billing, it's the amount we're collecting, and that there is a lot of billing'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that is happening out there that is not being collected right now. I will hope that the Council will be working with our city manager to identify how we can also increase the collection of these fees to make sure that we are indeed having this be a conservative budget request.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As the last speaker, I would be more than happy to make that into a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we have another councilmember de SAC has something else to say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A question. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I get that off the table first. Councilmember de Desai.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The question towards legal staff. Would the use of a CPI factor to increase the NOM in nominal sense to increase the rate, recognizing that in real inflation adjusted terms it doesn't. Recognizing that. Would that trigger a need for a whole new Nexus study?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Or is there some kind of language that says that that because the next study is predicated on the course of today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I did I did ask that question. And just to quickly address addressed it, since we are not claiming 100% of the fees, that that increase would still keep us within the costs that are very I mean, it's like a $12 a year increase.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It would keep us well within the costs that have already been identified in this study.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Maybe if I could address a couple of questions, I might have a little bit more information than our city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I'll just say next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's start with this issue and then your next she wrote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will just say that the Nexus study in terms of its legal validity, it's the assumptions are based upon what's before the council tonight it's not going to trigger a new Nexus study so long as we are as the chief has already said, we're not meeting our cost of service.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the council could direct staff to come back or could direct staff to if the council chose to adopt this matter. The Council could include a provision in the fee schedule that would require that the fees. Increase based upon the cost of living increases in the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chief Harris.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. Mayor, if I could just answer, probably Councilmember De Saag and Vice Mayor Knox White's question. If you look at resolution number one, 2191, the very last, whereas in that is currently allowing the council to further increase these fees annually by the consumer and or construct excuse me, construction price indices.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we already have that factor built in. But if you wanted to modify it to match a more you percentage, we can certainly do that too. There are nominal increases built in already which you know, will still keep us with higher amounts as the years go by.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we've already included that in here for your consideration tonight. So I'll leave it up to you with accounts discretion. But I believe that should answer the majority of what you're speaking of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Did that answer your question, Mr. De sir?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think, one I just want to put on record. My worry is that recognizing that, you know, it's in the resolution and everything is all one thing. You know, us doing internal analytics, you know, it's to say that it passes analytic and legal muster.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's all good within City Hall. But I wonder if we're making ourselves vulnerable to a lawsuit by someone who might say, wait, wait, wait, if you're going to even if you're going to increase it by a CPI factor, and even if that, you know, the rate is under whatever threshold it is now, could someone say, hey, you'",
        "'speaker_10': 'need a whole new study? Every time you change it, change the number. I don't know. That's all I'm saying. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I hear the I hear the concern and I think we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do this Mary Knox way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think we can just we can direct the staff to just increase the costs that are currently here by 3% each year, assuming a 3% CPI, assuming that that's going to be the highest that any of the COLAs that are that that the staff is going to get.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's well within the next study. So if the concern is in the future, we might increase it and get trapped. Get get caught by somebody saying, oh, you didn't do a new study before raising the fee. Then we can just direct staff to include a specific cost today that is well within the cost identified in the fee'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Okay. Councilmember, will you want to comment or ask a question?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm just looking at the city attorney here. Can you. The answer that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I. The problem. Okay. First of all, you know, to try and opine on whether or not we're going to be exposed to litigation every time the staff comes forward with the next study that that's that's a little difficult.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're always exposed to litigation. Every time you adopt a next study, I think we'd have to hear from NBC in terms of what the underlying assumptions are in the Nexis study. I've I've reviewed the Nexus study. I didn't see anything specifically that talked about personnel costs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I'd have to I'd have to look there. There is. Let me invite my my colleague as well, Lisa maxwell, who's got some more familiarity with the Nexus study, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Would you please wait until you're at the microphone, Ms.. Maxwell. And whoever is speaking, introduce yourself. Please use the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who would you like to speak?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right. The point I'm trying to get to and I'll. I'll I can ask, please, is, is the Nexus study establishes the fees, but I don't know what the underlying assumptions are because. You know, we didn't review the backup documentation, but I think that that the vice mayor's proposal would not trigger a a new Nexus study.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So did we have a question for the maker of the study?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the only comment I would give you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Guys could introduce yourself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please. Nicole Casey, I'm from NBC and I helped with the study. The only comment I would provide you guys is that CPI or Labor cost increase in between study years, which is every 3 to 5 years, would be a very common industry standard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It all comes back to the language in the Constitution and other government codes that we are working with the estimated reasonable cost of providing the service.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilmember DE So I can just ask questions. Is the proposal that Vice Mayor Knox White is raising, is that. Something that happens all the time across the cities that you work with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I believe you mentioned COLA in between years, which is different than CPI. That has to do more with labor cost increase or analyzed in the budget to see what that is for Alameda. And that is one very common methodology of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So did you have a question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I'm sorry. Through the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Church and through the chair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To the vice mayor. So is your proposal to increase it with COLA, increase it with CPI, increase it with the contract?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would I would say based based on that. Based on the contract, because we actually may change contracts in the middle tier. We would use the COLA that is provided in this state. It's almost entirely staff cost. So I reduce the staff costs, increase annual staff cost, increases the the metric because I think that would capture them'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And I imagine that if for some reason legal staff analyze this and says that was something we couldn't do, you could come back to us and we could amend a resolution or something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I'm sorry, Mr. Mueller, but I've closed public comment. Okay. We have three resolutions to vote on. So the first one is the. Resolution number 1 to 1 nine one, amending the resolution, amending M.P. resolution number 1 to 1 nine one and revised fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does someone want to make a motion on that?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like to I would like to move approval of that ordinance with the language that includes an annual call up. Sorry. It's just staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually. Why don't we hold on for just a minute while we have a little say? But now I would rather have you be. Yeah, let's. Okay. We're going to take a five minute break, everyone. Yeah, you got 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wait. Now you need brownies.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They just remembered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yes, we. We're back. Okay. Vice Mayor, next week you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So at the at the direction or with input from this, the city attorney, the budget director and the city manager, there are some issues, including that language. So we're going to approve the ordinance as written with direction to staff that when you bring back the master fee schedule each year, we should make sure that we have increased'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the fees that are in this schedule. We are approving by the court, by, by COLA or, you know, whatever is the appropriate, whatever it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Doesn't say COLA, but it does say the consumer and or construction price.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Indices, right? That's right. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we have it. We have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to. I almost forgot something, and I want to increase I want to include ensure that we are also billing in incremental. Time increments, not hours as as was.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's included in the master.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Just want to make sure. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we have a motion to have a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. I opposed. Okay. When oppose the motion carries 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Mayor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'd like to move. Adoption of the resolution approving workforce changes to add one division chief position to the fire department. Fire Prevention Services Division effective three 619 for an annual cost of 355. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a motion to have a second, second and discussion. There is a 70,000 vehicle expenditure and there is that next item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the next. I'm sorry. That is the modification. Okay. We have a motion in a second on favor. I opposed. No. Okay. The motion passes. 3 to 2. Okay. Now we move on to the third resolution. Who wants to take that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we there is a there's a residual.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will if no one else does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Move approval of the third resolution. Do I have to read it or do you got it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think we've got that. Yeah. All right. Is there a second? Second all in favor?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I, i.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Opposed. No. Right. The motion carries 3 to 2. Okay. And I think, Madam Vice Mayor. Nuts. Wait.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would like us to give direction to bring back on a six month basis a an off agenda billing and collection fees report for these new fees so that we can actually monitor that we're collecting the fees that we say that we in the amounts that we are saying that we will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you want this to be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If I don't know what the will of this board is, is to actually vote to give direction on that. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or you think we have to vote? I think we give staff direction. But I'm trying to get clarity on what the direction is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To bring to bring it to provide an off agenda report on the collection sorry, the billing and collection of all these fees on a six month basis to the Council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember Vela So on a six month basis, for how long?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I would say until we decide we don't need it anymore. I'd like to say we haven't. We have a four year roll out. I'd like to see it over the next year.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is it possible at some point to sync it up with when we're doing mid-year? I mean, I, I think I guess my question is, in the first year, I can understand since we're starting it kind of close to the mid budget cycle, is there any way we can, we can coordinate some of these meetings with some of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the other report backs that we're getting?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to interrupt. The question is, did we lose Elaina Adair? Did we send her home? She did okay, because I was going to she's the finance director and has to. That's okay. We she has a long commute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, I well, I okay. So I'm hearing of some concern on the part of Councilmember Village. You want to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I hear, I hear what the vice mayor is saying and I'm supportive of what he's proposing. I don't have a problem with it. I just I think maybe if we can coordinate it with the scheduling of other things, then we can actually get the report back when we're actually collecting all of that data at some point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So rather than doing it every six months, if we can in the first year, I can understand it being a little different from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What if I think I'm supportive of the vice mayor because we are staking a lot on this. This is paying a position set to not impact the general fund. What if six month intervals for the first year and then after that to sync it up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fee reporting?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, that's what I'm proposing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Understood. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I will communicate that to the finance director, but the clerk, I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Has got it in them and.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Briefly discuss as a council the logistics, goals and vision surrounding the March 16, 2019 priority setting workshop. And this item was placed on the agenda through Custom Councilmember Odie.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. First, Joe, it's good to see you up and around and back in public, so it's good to see you. I just put this in because I really was not informed a lot about how this workshop is going to play out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The logistics. I think I had heard that staff was not going to be there, which, you know, that was a little concerning because I think it's important for staff to hear our thought processes and our priorities and then that this was not going to be videotaped.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if somebody wasn't there, they couldn't watch a video, they'd have to listen to an audio. So I just thought since it's a council priority setting workshop, the council should have a little input in the organization and planning of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to date, you know, I really haven't been asked to do that. So I thought maybe all of us could kind of brainstorm and figure out how we want this to to play out. Because I remember last time, you know, four of us wanted to do something regarding, you know, team building and and working together and, you'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know, that kind of got nixed. So I just want to make sure that we know what we're expecting. And, you know, all of us have some input in how it how it flows so we can have the most productive priority setting workshop that we have that we could have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. District. Clarification. I hope you received an email today that was sent to us by Sarah Henry for reading the email from Management Partners and specifically I think Cynthia KURTZ and of Management Partners in it does note that it talks about what will what will happen and also says in preparation for the workshop, Cynthia KURTZ'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of Management Partners met with each of you to hear what you believe is an important priority for the city. And this survey, which we're asked to complete online before March the eighth, I think the end of this week, seeks to identify broad areas of shared interest by asking you to rank the topics for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The results of the short survey will inform the preparation of the workshop agenda, but I know a number of us have had the opportunity to meet with someone from management partners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I've met with her too, and shared my priorities. But you know, we haven't discussed whether it's appropriate for staff to be there. I know our new city manager is going to be there, but technically he's not on the payroll yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, I mean, are we going to rely on him to relay everything? I mean, and the fact that we're having this not here in the council chambers, you know, I don't know who made that decision. We didn't have any input in that decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know if any of my colleagues had any input in the decision. You know, setting the agenda. We haven't had any. And I think last time, you know, we kind of were pretty clear and we had some input.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just want to have the council discuss it. And, you know, if.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Only I'm happy to discuss it, I think we have a lot of input as to what we want to have discussed and how we want to run. But let's let's hear from others. Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I think the idea of a priority setting meeting is absolutely fantastic. Not that I ever want to use this phrase, but I'm going to use it right now. You know, I've been on council previously going on 14 years and we've never had a priority setting type of powwow.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, I know that there was one when I was not on council, but, um, so, so I look forward to it. If council member Odie has some suggestions that he would like us to consider, because I think the issue isn't so much what we're going to discuss, but how we're going to go about, you know, interacting'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with each other. You know, I'm hoping so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll just chime in about the staff part. So bear in mind, we ask a lot of our staff. This is their Saturday. We will definitely have them there for our budget workshops. But the way this was envisioned was, is from my meeting with Miss KURTZ was to, to give this council a chance to talk among themselves'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and really flesh out what our concerns are and and our desires moving forward. And so we certainly would factor staff into the equation when we're, say, talking about the budgets, but we also need to be sensitive about asking them to come in on their Saturdays.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And right now, as we all know, a number of our staff are our department heads are stretching themselves to cover more than one position. So I and, you know, I've said this more than once, I am really pleased to be working with this council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we've accomplished a lot already in our two and a half months on the job together, but by all means, it will be a better workshop if you put your input, you know, to the to the facilitators because they're, you know, they're the ones who just want to do what we want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they've done a lot of these sorts of things before.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I know that. And I mean, just the fact that you brought up that it was envisioned, you know, I was given that same report back from the from the facilitator. And I thought that the envisioning process is something that the council as a whole should, should be part of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I don't feel like we were a part of it. I mean, I don't know who did it. You know, I don't know who chose the facilitator. I don't know who decided that staff shouldn't be attending. I don't know who decided it should be at the library where it's not going to be on video for the public'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to be able to review in a transparent manner like all of our other meetings. I know I was not involved in that decision making process. I don't know if any of my colleagues were. I don't know. It was a subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think for all of us to be working together, we have to actually work together and collaborate and, you know, not just be told this is how it's going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think that that's the opportunity we have this Saturday. And I did have a meeting with one of the members from management partners because because they asked me to to sit and give some overview. And I said, I really don't have much experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly not with a successfully run a priority setting workshop, because we didn't have complete buying last time and and last time. I think my feeling was I was open to just working with the facilitator. I feel like it's always you should be open to new ideas that people who have done these things before, you know, just help'",
        "'speaker_0': 'us communicate with each other and bring out what we want our priorities to be for the year going forward. I mean, ideally, you would probably do this in the very beginning of the year, but I think we can all reflect back over the last couple of months and realize we were pretty busy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yes, our new city manager will not be our new city manager yet, but he does want to attend and just sit in the audience to hear us and hear, you know, get to know our concerns and ideas better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's great. Other council members, Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think. You know, I think. I think that there's a lot of things that this council, this current council is doing different from certain. I've only been on two councils, but that's doing very different from my years of experience.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do have two. So I can see years at this point. I do think, though, that. You know, I think that in for transparency sake, I think that there is it is helpful for us to kind of talk through why we're doing the priority session workshop, what we're hoping to get out of it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I appreciate that the individual interviews with management partners and kind of them getting our feedback was interesting. Just to look through the survey today to see what other people had suggested and also how she processed what she thought.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I said my priorities were because one of my priorities was not listed. So it was it was kind of interesting, too. I mean, I think we all think that we're communicating. But what people hear and what we think we said could sometimes be different.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think also it's Councilmember Otis point. I think even to just have a brief conversation right now about how do we think the meeting's going to run? You know, I got the sense I mean, I kind of reading into the survey of what was there, what was, you know, what the day might look like.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I also think that, you know, this is one of the detriments of not having and not being a full time council and being the part time council that we are is that we don't really get to spend a lot of time together as a body and we don't get to have these really kind of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Esoteric conversations about what our priorities are. And I'm really looking forward to hearing from all of you not necessarily about the referral list or the budget process. I think we'll have those discussions, but what are your actual priorities?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that there's a lot of things that we get asked on the campaign trail. But at the end of the day, a lot of the kind of key topics of discussion sometimes politically are not the key issues facing the city that people don't necessarily want to talk about, people take for granted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so so I think, you know, at least from my perspective, I think we we owe it to each other to have that conversation. But I also kind of I get that and I don't want it to be a staff dominated conversation in that I don't want to get I personally don't want to have staff presentations on'",
        "'speaker_8': 'on everything. But I do feel like it might be helpful to have staff present or available to provide some context and background information. Since when we have this conversation, like let's say we discuss this specific issue and say this is this is a priority and this is why to kind of understand how we've gotten there and, you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'know, or to for them to at least know that that's what we. So I guess my my question is, if we're not going to have staff there to kind of take notes and get that feedback, is is this the first of a couple workshops where we get to have these conversations or and it since it's not going'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to be taped, how are we going to relay it to staff if they're not going to be there? Can we can we discuss that a little bit right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So my understanding is that there will be a product, a final product put together by the management partners who are doing this. And one of the other reasons not to have staff there was to have just that conversation among the council without, you know, referring out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also, we should be able to put out what our priorities, our hopes, our aspirations are without even worrying about the cost of it. We'll get you know, we have our priorities and then we'll go to the budget hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with our priorities in mind, we'll figure out what we can afford. But it's not a matter of, okay, we'd like to do this, but we can't afford it. It's, it's that'll help us fashion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Framework can you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Kind of give me an example of that? Like I, I get how maybe if we say, okay, the swimming pool is our priority, but if we say something like housing is our priority, I guess my question is, how does that factor into like the budget conversation or in your mind, how does that affect the budget conversation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So staying with the topic of the council referral, I guess I could go I mean, and again, remember, this is our workshop and you can speak up and say, you know, I think we need to spend more time doing this when we're there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But for instance, on the housing. One of the things that I and interim city attorney just cut me off if you think I'm going too far off script. But one of the things that I think we need to consider is possibly doing an affordable housing bond like some of our neighboring cities have done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that, you know, might be something to get out in the conversation. And then we'll back that around with, well, what other possible measures might we be bringing to voters? There's there's lots of possibilities we have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so what I'm hearing this is the first time I've had this conversation. So I'm just for the members of the public. This is the first time I've had this conversation with any of you. And I think that so I do think Councilmember O.T. for for bringing the referral in, that I think it's given us an opportunity'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to actually have this conversation with each other, because I don't get to spend that much time with all of you chatting. But so so it will be a little freeform then in your mind that everyone will kind of get it'll be a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then when management partners comes back with like this final work product, if there's something that, let's say Councilmember Ody or Councilmember Desai or any of us feel doesn't quite capture the essence of the conversation or what they intended, is there an opportunity for us to review it and comment back?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there an opportunity for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To repress a panic button? I'm so sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're good. We are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. We keep on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it where.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Everybody's need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have? Yeah. So anybody who's working so sorry to our two wonderful offices. Nice to see you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'll say hi. Thank you for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Responding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Do we need to, officer? Do we need to somehow?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just told you about this, right, Jane?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am not really cleared.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is will you clear? Okay. And then what? What?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I will release for the false alarm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now stop. She's talking. Let's hear what she's saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. If this happens, then we'll just come and kind of poker head. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. And then I think what we probably need all of us up here is a little. Thank you. A little tutorial on how to avoid doing that. Because I have to say, when Mary Gilmore was mayor, there was a time when we had a speaker and he was a little scary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I was sitting next to her there and I'm whispering, Press your panic button, press your panic button. And she's hissing. I can't find it. But then about a day or two later, I was giving a group of second and third graders a tour of accounts, and I was letting them do a mock council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I was there. And pretty soon this big officer showed the doorway. And I said, You just said, now you're in. One of my second or third graders managed to find it, but.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know what that says about me. But when I was on the transportation chair during do time, they installed new buttons after that incident.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll assume it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was a John has the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, there used to be only one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. So if there is there an opportunity for feedback, correction and. And will, that will be so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And could I just throw in a suggestion? Did you all get Ms.. KURTZ a business card after you email her now? I mean, well, not now, but, you know, your first opportunity and it raises questions because, again, I have only sort of a vague understanding, but it's very much there will be some facilitation because that's how you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get the conversation and the structure going. But. This is our workshop. And.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then will the will there be an audio recording of it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's all we have over there as audio.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there'll be an audio recording and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You go where.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is. Meeting, meeting minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So there is a re there's a recording meeting. Yeah. It's a process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But for workshops we typically don't do extensive white capture. We just get the highlights and the report out from that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then if there's, if there's a topic where we all go, okay, yes, I'm I'm interested in this or I'm interested in having a follow up workshop on, say, funding measures or whatever. Um, we could, the process would be what do we have to vote on that as a council?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do we give direction to come back? How, how would this work?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's the sort of thing I would think we can just arrange to have agenda is to approve another another process. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And again, bear in mind, I am speaking about this having never attended one that, uh, that I felt was really, you know, you were there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And, you know, I think we missed an opportunity with the team building and communication portion, and I'd like to make sure we do that, because I do think there are this referral, you know, kind of an example.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think there are ways we can improve that and I would like to have that. And as far as Melissa's comment about, you know, I don't want staff talking, but I would like somebody, you know, if possible, voluntary, you know, not banning them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But if they want to come, they could come in and hear what they what they say. Hear what?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Somebody from your office be president. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, yeah. But so so to Councilmember Cody's point, could we invite staff? We could say option having this if you would like. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The public is invited.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public. They can certainly come, but. Oh. Okay. Mr. Rudy, did you want to say something?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was going to say we had them standing by, but after direction, I excused him for the weekend. You could ask them, but I told them. You don't have to hold that day open. Weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And my understanding is that a council retreat is a council retreat. And it is, of course, open to the public. But it's not a check in with staff, and I'm not sure which staff we would choose, but what what are our thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor, you haven't said too much or anything yet. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, so even so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If there is so if there is follow up, then the way I guess to to my earlier question, we would get it to the impacted staff and say, here's the portion of the meeting. We discussed it at around the 35 minute mark or the 60 minute mark, if you want to hear council conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there's a way for them to hear our our discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And well, there are 30 minutes or how is that worth? Yeah, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mean, I can capture the basic overviews. Typically we make a workshop like less detailed minutes, but if you guys want to request it for that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Meeting, I will. So you said there's also an audio recording. Right. So if they wanted to hear the discussion, we could point them to and say around this, Marcus, when we discussed it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the facilitator is going to do a report as well. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, those are those are good things. And I'm glad we I feel better. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then and then I also I think my other concern is just the public, because last time we had a lot of members of the public show up and and I would assume that there's going to be members of the public showing up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So can we. I think part of this conversation is also for their benefit about what they could expect.'",
        "'speaker_0': '15 minutes of public comment in the beginning. And then we launch into the workshop and it's a council workshop after that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there isn't going to be specifically agendas talking points. We're just going to it's going to be a free form dialog about priorities in general.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure that the facilitators will have some way to tease that out of this. Not that this is a terribly reticent group, but, you know, it's because early on honest that I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Think I think the way that it went before for for the benefit of the new council members was essentially we went through our referral list and it was a very kind of stunted conversation at times. And then we had members of the public who wanted to comment on specific priorities because they thought we were referrals, because they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'thought we were making specific decisions that day. So what I'm hearing is, is that we're not making any specific decisions, really. We're just kind of directing where we might find broader conversation points, either to agendas on as a regular agenda item or to create another work session or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there were two that sometimes get kind of conflated. We did do this council well before it. Council member D.C. and vice mayor joined it. We did do a budget workshop and certainly we had all the staff and we had members of the public and kind of lobbying for their their projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This one. No, it's that's not the way it's intended to go. And I will also say that I think one major difference is, presumably we have five people just willing to give it a try. And I you know, you don't always have a script going in and know everything that's going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that it's worth doing. And just think of we're at the beginning of a new term. We're about to embark with a new city manager. And I think it's it's a good time to do something like this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, without really knowing exactly what it is, I think it's going to be a positive experience. But vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So a few things I was going to ask about the recordings. I'm glad. I'm glad it'll be recorded. I think this referral and our conversation earlier about subcommittees and it came up at our last meeting. I'm hoping that a good chunk, a quarter to a third of the beginning of our workshop, can be to us talking about'",
        "'speaker_9': 'how we want to work together. The last council, you know, had issues and there were lots of referrals, some of which were put forward and not not adopted because people didn't want to change the change rules. And, you know, but it didn't work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. I think we all know that. I mean, I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that. I know some of us here. You should take it. I want to be careful. I would really like to spend some time talking about how we want to work as a body, how we want to work with staff, and how we want to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'work with our boards and commissions. Because I think that we have a lot of tradition and history in the way that we work. That is just things just were done that way and they have been done that way for 15 years and it doesn't work like an example.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it's odd that I have no idea what the Transportation Commission is doing unless I choose to listen to the meeting. Right. Just. Just, you know. Right. So. So I think we could talk about that a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think we could talk about, you know, standing committees and ad hoc committees and that kind of stuff. So I would like to throw that out there. I haven't looked at the surveys, so maybe that's there. Yeah, I would also like to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Say, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I talked I did talk a little bit to the, to the, the, uh, consultants who I thought were fabulous about the agenda. And I, I think the referrals point to the more that we can just basically say whatever agenda you think is the right agenda after listening to the five of us is probably the best way to'",
        "'speaker_9': 'set the agenda at this point in time. I just just that that would be my recommendation. And then I think we should also to to council member fellow's point about the public, because I have met with a number of them, whether it be the swim community or etc., asking who should come to this and what should we'",
        "'speaker_9': 'be focusing on? Right. Not telling us what to say, but should we be coming in asking for the five things we want in know? Or is it, you know, don't forget to be renters. We never forget about renters.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just to be clear, I think I think making sure that our agenda is really clear about what level of detail are we going to talk about a housing bond and get into a discussion about housing bonds? Are we going to say, hey, we think, you know, finding funding for housing is good ideas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our housing bond tax, you know, let's let's tell staff, you know, figure out how to pay for housing. Right. Or figure out, you know, come up with an affordable housing plan that has a funding mechanism, that kind of that kind of stuff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think. Really making sure that our agenda transmits to the people who are going to read it from act, right? There are going to be lots of people who are interested. We've already said we're going to talk about the Sunshine Ordinance and give some direction on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But but so that people know what to expect, I think will be really important. And I'm worried a little bit that if we we're going to want it to be nice and vague so we can talk broadly, but we also want to kind of, you know, set a tone of like this and and then kind of hold'",
        "'speaker_9': 'each other to that level a little bit as well. So those are my things. I agree. I want this to be a team building. I want this to be all of us just talking and comfortably and freely about what we would like to see.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Finding common ground. Also finding places where we might disagree, but we can support moving forward in a conversation, even if it's not the one we. So that. Yeah, those are my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm also a little concerned because I think, again, we really haven't spent that much time chatting about these things. And even when we do spend time together, it's very limited to what the agenda is and before us. And we don't get to have these bigger conversations that there's a lot that we're packing in to one day.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so, you know, is there an opportunity and one thing, we don't have to decide it now, but at the meeting, perhaps. Is there going to be some sort of follow up to this where we can kind of have another workshop or that sort of thing?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And what's that process going to look like?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what I will say is that these two women come very highly recommended and they've done this with another number of other cities and organizations. So I have faith in them leading this process. I would say that if you're right, it's a lot to pack into a day, but this is our opportunity to have that time with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'each other. And I think they know how to get bodies talking and focus. I mean, again, it's a you know, it is the unknown out there. And we can you know, we can be cynical going into it or we can just be open and say, let's, you know, give it our best shot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we feel that we need more time and to continue the process, we can do that. We're the city council. We can we can do that. So I would say let's take it the first step at a time, see how it goes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The I'm thinking back, I probably shouldn't even bring this up. But I think the first time ever that we did one of these, I almost feel like the facilitator maybe didn't quite run screaming from the room, but said, Don't ever call me again or something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not what it's not going to be this experience. First of all, I'm just really impressed with these facilities when I've seen them. They have experience working with other with other cities. The one of them is the former both public works director and city manager of I want to say, Pasadena, California.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so let's see what we see. Let's get our surveys filled out and email them if you have even more you want to say. And then by the end of the session Saturday, I'm sure there must be a next steps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you know what? But but we'll you know, we'll make sure that it's not just leaving us hanging.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess that I mean, I'm actually excited about it. I mean, not cynical. I think it's going to be a great, great time for us to talk and get to know each other better and find out ways we could work together and collaborate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, collaboration is a two way street. I mean, it's not just, you know, one way. So I hope we can explore those things. And I do think this is something we should do every year. I mean, it just doesn't make sense that we don't do this because it needs staff, needs that guidance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the council needs to, you know, set our priorities. Some cities, you know, when they have agendas, they say, well, what a priority of the council that's been pre-approved this support. So we're all kind of rowing the same boat in the same direction and working towards the same goals that we ourselves had set.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm excited about it. I think it's going to be really good. The last one was not so valuable, but I mean, I hope this one is a lot better. And, you know, I'd just like to see us be able to find ways to work together and, you know, have those those conversations that, you know, we can't'",
        "'speaker_5': 'really have on a Tuesday night at 11.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anyone else can follow.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just want to and you know, what kind of intrigues me about this process is it's an opportunity to talk about higher level qualitative concerns about the direction of our city, as well as higher level quantitative concerns, and to somehow to convey that, but then also to kind of encourage operationalizing those concerns and in ways that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'perhaps our policies or programs. But but usually as a council we usually just get nitty gritty right into the subject matter, you know, because that's what that's what matters at the end of the day, you know, does the police car have enough gas to to to go out and do their job or, you know, to the library'",
        "'speaker_10': 'have enough books in the library? I mean, that's what matters the most. But a lot of the actual services that we delivered come from a perspective of philosophy about how we organize, you know, what is important and, and i.e., prioritize.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, so for me, I see this. That March 16th as an opportunity to talk about these higher level concerns and how I might operationalize those higher level concerns. So like, for example, I'm the one who had raised the issue of, you know, strengthening what I call public trust.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What does that mean? Well, this is an opportunity to talk about why I think it's important and ways in which I think we as a city might might operationalize that or not. But at least it's an opportunity to talk about that at a higher level first and then move on or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Vice Mayor I just wanted to Councilmember Phyllis Point, I just want to make sure I think at the end of the I had actually had the idea. I think we should probably consider having a half day workshop, whether it's quarterly or every every six months or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And you know why? Because I don't think we're going to be able to get halfway through all that stuff we want to get through. But I'd just like to make sure that the agenda at the end of it, somewhere in the in the things we're talking about, just has a next steps.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what do we want to do based on how do we feel things got?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So. And I would second that because I also think full for weekend days. Well efficient can also be inefficient and that we they can be very draining and perhaps at our next one, there'll be a baby at it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will take care of holding babies. Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So one thing I want to thank everyone for this conversation. This is how I envision this going. So I appreciate the the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will commit to sending you all. Feel free to contact Ms.. KURTZ directly, but I will do my best to summarize this discussion that I've been taking notes in and make sure that your thoughts are incorporated. So thank you all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Moving on. Our next item is Council Communications. And I have one that I hope you will indulge me. This is actually because it came to me a little bit late. But it's important for the RAC, the rent review advisory committee, to feel they've got a couple of vacancies.'"
