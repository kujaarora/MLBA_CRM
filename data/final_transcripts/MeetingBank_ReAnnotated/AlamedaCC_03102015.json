    "Housing and Density Bonus Policies and Programs Workshop.": [
        "'speaker_4': 'Jennifer Art. And she's going to focus on the transportation side of the equation. But we're both and I think staff is pleased to have this opportunity, and we're very glad that the council scheduled this special workshop on the issues of housing and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are a handful of issues in Alameda that just dominate every conversation. It's not limited to housing and transportation, but if there's five or six major issues in Alameda that we should talk about and we talk about all the time again and again over the years, it's two of those issues are housing and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this is clearly a very important issue for this community. Your last council or last council spent a lot of time discussing these issues. The planning board spends an incredible amount of time on every single project talking about the relationship between development and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your Transportation Commission is working on this, the issue of transportation constantly, and of course, your staff is almost constantly working on this. So we're really excited to be able to be here and and really sort of give an overview of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's we've kept the presentations fairly simple, high level, because we just feel like you will know a lot of this information, the council members. But it's really important that the Alameda community understands some of the foundational issues that underlie all of these questions because in addition to all the conversations that happen in City Hall all the time'",
        "'speaker_4': ', as you know, the Alameda community talks about these issues as well. So you can't pick up the newspaper in Alameda without seeing something about either housing or transportation. So we really see this as an opportunity to sort of open up the discussion and really try to provide information for what is an ongoing discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We never finish talking about housing and transportation. It's not like we're going to solve it tonight. It's not going to happen. We're trying to set the foundations for additional discussions and future decisions by this Council over time. I am going to focus on three questions, the three questions that were raised at your January six hearing, and they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are sort of paraphrased. Number one, is there a problem with our density bonus ordinance? And if so, what should we do to fix that? Number two, do we need a moratorium on density bonus applications or density bonus housing projects to give us time to make those fixes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then third, and this is probably the. Big question in the room that's going to be covered both by myself a little bit, and I'm going to get sort of the big picture and Jennifer is going to really follow up with much more detail.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is is our transportation system really ready for more housing in Alameda? And that's the question. Well, we just heard a speaker ask it. Everybody on the street is asking that question. And, of course, the council is constantly asking that question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. I'm just going to dove right in here and. See if I can even figure out how to. Here we go. Oh, that's the magic. Of technology. Okay. So I'm going to just really, you know, in 12 slides, I'm going to cover the state housing obligations, the state density bonus law and the recommendation and and our recommendations'",
        "'speaker_4': 'about what to do about that state limitations on moratoria and our ability to do a moratorium. And then I'm going to give you a little bit of an overview of what is going on with housing development in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I'm going to finish up with sort of a big picture look at transportation and housing. And then the way we've set up this presentation I'm at that point can essentially stop. It's really up to you, Madam Mayor, if you at that point want to open the conversation, take public speakers, discuss the initial recommendations on in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'response to the three questions or at that point, if you would like, is that sort of a natural transition to keep going then right into transportation? If you want to just get all the presentations all the way up front, it's completely up to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jennifer and I can do it either way. So. This conversation, this discussion really can't happen in an educated way without really understanding the sort of the legal framework. Alameda Where part of the state of California, our land use regulations are essentially handed down to us by the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And everything we do is sort of governed within that framework. The state of California, through legislation as a has established sort of three issues that this the legislature has decided are important statewide concerns. And what that means is the state has said, look, if you're part of the state, you sort of have to play ball.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what they those three issues are housing. Housing is important to the state of California. Affordable housing is particularly important to the state of California. Climate change is a major issue for the state of California. And then finally and what the state has done in the last five or six years has linked transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's a link between where we put housing, where we fund transportation, and how we as a state address the issue of climate change. Of course, as a very low lying island in the bay, probably very few cities in California are as are as vulnerable to climate change and sea level rise as Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Alameda historically has also sort of agreed with these three issues, which is housing is important. Climate change is something we absolutely need to be thinking about and planning for. And, of course, transportation. We need to fund better transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there is nobody in this city and nobody in city hall who is going to stand up and tell you this transportation system is fine. Stop worrying about us. Stop complaining about it. We all acknowledge our transportation system is not fine and we need to continually take steps to improve it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what does the state do besides pass laws like that? Well, what they do in their laws, as they say, and we're going to make sure that cities do play ball through the housing process. And so what they require under state law is that every city meet included adopt a housing element, housing element as a portion of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a piece of our general plan, which is the constitution by which our land use regulation flows. It's our statement of policy. It is the foundation for our zoning, which is the foundation upon which we make land use decisions about housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it says you have to update your housing element every 7 to 8 years. And we, the state of California, will certify whether your housing element is in conformance with state law. And in that housing element, what you must do every city in California is show us how you're going, how your policies and your zoning are going'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to ensure that you've made enough land available to meet your essentially your fair share of the state's housing needs. And that's called the regional housing and reasonable housing needs. Thank you. Assessment or we often call it you'll hear people call it Arena RH and a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that process plays out in every city and county in the state of California every seven, ten, 7 to 8 years. And then the state has passed a number of laws that sort of basically say, look, and if you do not play ball, then there are some consequences.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If your housing element is not certified by the state, then you by definition, do not have a adequate general plan. And under state law, if you don't have an adequate general plan, then you can't be making land use decisions at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether it's to approve development or deny development, you are also subject to lawsuits on any decisions you do make if you have a just efficient general plan. And our neighbor to the south, the city of Pleasanton, has a rather unfortunate example of what happens to a city when they don't comply with state law and then get get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sued. It was a rather ugly scenario and cost the city a lot of money in that lawsuit, which they ultimately lost. So what happens, Will? Does that mean okay, that would be great. Maybe all development just stops because you've a lot of people around here saying we need a moratorium, we need to stop development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, that's not really what it does. What happens is. The state says, well, there's some development that just has to go on. You might have residents who need second story additions or businesses that need to upgrade their premises.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So every one of those things, if your city want to approve one of those little projects. Well, you have to send it to the court. The judge will decide whether you can approve that or not. That is a very long and cumbersome and difficult process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And residents in those cities generally hate that and get very frustrated by the fact that it's taken them so much longer just to get a simple building permit, because they have to go to a court to get it approved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what the state says is and if you don't have a certified housing loan, if you're not playing ball, then every seven years that Reno which for us the city of Alameda is for this period which is 2015 to 2023, is 1754 units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you don't, then the next round when we'll give you a new Reno allocation of maybe another 7000 units. Well, it compounds. So if you don't comply this round, then let's say you eventually comply and in for the next round will your allocation for the next round will be twice as much, which means just puts a larger'",
        "'speaker_4': 'burden on the community to provide more land for housing. The last council well, not the last of 2012. The city of Alameda finally got its housing element certified in 2012. There was a lot of blowback from that. A lot of folks were concerned about the effects of actually adopting a housing element in compliance with state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If that council had not done that, our arena today would not be 1700 units. It would be closer to 5000 units because we would have had the last round for the 2007 to 14 Arena, which was the 2012 housing element, got certified for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That arena was 2200 units. So if we had not got adopted our housing home in 2012, the arena we would be working with for this seven year period would be the 2200 plus the 1725, and that's how much land we would have been providing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's really important that cities and counties get their housing elements certified. The other thing to state saying is that cities that don't get certified, we're going to start cutting off funding. So you want state funding for parks, which we have been fairly successful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have a fantastic recreation and Parks Department who is very good at getting state money for Jean Sweeny Park for Estuary Park and the various parks. Ms. WOOD Well, Woodbridge Bridge just got. Two years ago. Over a year and a half ago, $210,000 grant from the park, from the state for Estero Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She couldn't even applied for that grant if the city hadn't certified its housing element in 2012. Transportation money. Infrastructure money. Money from the state to deal with sea level rise. It's all being tied to whether we have a certified housing element.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's sort of a scary story. The good news is 2012, the city got its housing element certified, so we took care of the last round. Then in 2014, the state established the new round, the new arena for every city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ours was 1725. We had more than enough sites to accommodate it. So the council in 2014 adopted a new housing element. Many of you were here and the state certified us in in August of 2014. And so we are good to go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the next seven years. And we don't have to worry about any of those ugly consequences of not being certified. So first question, we have a state density bonus ordinance. During the Del Monte hearings in December and January, a lot of questions came up about our local density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And really the first question from January six final hearing was we think there might be a problem and we should probably do something about fixing it. So. The thing to understand about housing density bonuses. Housing density bonuses are established by state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the state has basically passed a law that says every city in California must incentivize affordable housing and through what's called a density bonus project through density bonuses. So the state has passed a very detailed law that lays out exactly how you do it, exactly how many bonuses projects should be getting, what waivers they should be getting'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for the specified amount of affordable housing that is provided. State law says also that the city should adopt a local ordinance to implement the state law. State law says you can't conflict with the state law and the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the state law says that if you don't adopt a local ordinance, then you just follow the state law. So there's not a whole lot of flexibility for cities and counties when adopting local density bonus laws. So the city of Alameda, we finally did get one adopted in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've had it in place for about 5 to 6 years now. We've had a handful of projects that have used it. Not every project does. Obviously, if a project moves forward and doesn't do any housing at all and it just doesn't doesn't apply, and we have had it since the adoption of the ordinance, at least one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and since the 2012 housing or at least one project where we told the state we would make it available for housing and we zoned it for housing. And the owner of the property, the Gateway Project, which is where the In-N-Out Burger and those the bank and the then the gas station were going, they just said, we don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want build any housing at all. So we didn't put any housing on the site. Remember, state law doesn't say you have to build housing. It's not our job to actually build the housing is to make the land available and zone it for housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Two projects, Marina Shores, which is under construction, is the Bueno Vista Project and sometimes called Marina Cove two, and of course, the Oakmont Senior Living Building right across from Cardinal Point. Sometimes called Cardinal Point two, they are building housing, but they didn't ask for any bonuses at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In fact, they didn't even build as many housing units as we told the state we could accommodate on their site. So they didn't even maximize the residential density under the zoning that we allowed under our zoning. So density bonus law didn't even factor into those projects for projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since 2000, nine have requested density bonuses. The Del Monte Project, which was approved just recently and we've been talking about we have an application for a project at 2100 Clement, which is in the early phases of the public review process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We had our first public hearing last night with the planning board on that project. It is requesting a density bonus of 22%. The total project is 58 units. The Boat Works Project, which is it? Oak and Clement also requested a 22% density bonus that was approved in 2011 is still not built.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the vacant property at Oak and Clement. I think I said that Alameda landing. There was a mistake. I made a mistake in the staff report. I said that that was a project that didn't use a density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was wrong. They did use a density bonus of 22%. I was being a little sloppy there. The thing that threw me off was we entitled Alameda Landing for 300 housing units back in 2006. In the master plan, they only built 285.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I was moving too fast. I'm like, Oh, of course they didn't use the density bonus they built less than we entitled them for. But the reality of it is, and this was pointed out to me just in the last couple of days when I went back and looked at the way they did it, the base project'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I proposed was much less than two, 200 and a 300 units, and then they asked for a bonus on top of that. So technically, they absolutely did request a density bonus of 22%, but end of the day, it was still less units than we had originally entitled for the site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to date we haven't gotten the maximum bonus you can get under density. Bonus law is 35%. We have not yet, I'm sure we will, but to date we haven't received a single request for a 35% density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's probably because the way the state law is structured, you don't need to add a lot of additional affordable housing units to get a 22% density bonus. But you to get a 35% density bonus, you have to add a lot of affordable housing units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it seems like the sweet spot on the developer side is that 22%. But I'm sure at some point we'll get a 35% density bonus request. So getting to the specific question that was before us at the Del Monte hearings, our density bonus ordinance lays out a large, a long list of things that we need to see'",
        "'speaker_4': '. We need to see the total number of units, the affordability breakdown, where the units will be in the project, what the size of the units will be. The whole point is of our ordinance is and all the similar requirements is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Developer walks in the door and says, I'm going to give you these affordable units. So you need to give us give us give me a bonus under state law. Well, okay. But we need to be sure we're actually going to get the affordable units you're promising us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we say we want to see where the units are going to be. We want to see how big the affordable units are going to be. We're going to want to know how you're going to guarantee that we actually get them, what the phasing is, what the floor plans are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If many of your promising to give us the affordable units, let's let's see the details. So for a normal project like the, you know, property across the street, let's say, or something on Park Street where they're coming in, they're like, Yep, I want my approvals from the planning board or council and then I want to go downstairs'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and get our building permits tomorrow and build the thing. Well, yeah, absolutely. We need all those requirements and we need them now. The the issues that came up with the Del Monte is that in our development code, we also have a process for large, complex, mixed use projects which will be developed over time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when I mean over time, I mean in less than two years, every project in Alameda that gets approved, if you don't start construction within two years, it just expires. The idea of that, of course, is if we approve something today which we think is okay and some, then they don't build it and they come back in'",
        "'speaker_4': '20 years and say, Oh, I've got this approval from 20 years ago. I want to build that project. You approved 20 years ago or is no, that's expired. You have to go back to the process. But for very large, complex projects like Del Monte, which can take 15 years for Alameda Point, which is going to take 20'",
        "'speaker_4': 'years, Alameda Landing is going to take 20 years. Marina Village is still not done. Harbor Bay, Business Park. 20 years later, we're still not done. When you're developing a project like that, the ah what our code allows for is a series of subsequent actions so that you can, at the beginning of the process, approve the large concept'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of what you want, whether it's Harbor Bay, Business Park, whether it's a marina village, mixed use community, or whether it's Alameda Landing. It's going to be, you know, how many total units, how many square feet of commercial, how many acres of park, and then set up a process by which the developer can come back in five years'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or six years when they're actually ready to start building each phase of the project. And what our code allows is at that point, when somebody, the Harbor Bay Business Park wants to build like we have a hotel application right now, the master plan for that business park was approved in 1981.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's when the city said, we are it's okay to do hotels. It's okay to do things like Peet's Coffee and the VF Corporation. And that's when we said that in 1981, but they didn't have the designs for those buildings then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when those projects come in now, what we tell them is, yeah, conceptually you're consistent with the plan, but you know what? You can't get a building permit right now. You're going to come back up here and have a hearing before the planning board and or council to review your plan for that building, because this is the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'first time we're seeing the actual design of that building. And that's a great system because, you know, things like sustainable design, things like parking ratios and and transportation and transport, transport and design, sea level rise. You know, those are things we weren't even weren't even in our vocabulary 20 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They are now. And so it's of our ability to sort of update and make sure that each project as it comes forward over time, we can ensure that it meets our current expectations. So with the density bonus application for Del Monte, that's exactly what we were doing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We were laying out a series of steps. It would have to occur for each phase of the project. And so the master plan said, we guarantee this many number of affordable housing units and we guarantee that these in these ratios and it guaranteed the phasing of when those affordable housing units would come in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But it didn't provide the floor plans for each affordable housing unit. And our approach was, well, that's okay, because we're going to see those floor plans when you come in for the design review for each piece of the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we'll look at them at that point. But we had enough assurance that we knew exactly what we were going to be getting and we knew we had the discretion to enforce those assurances, assurances at each step now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we explained that process. We went after your after the council said, Yeah, we don't need to look at that. We went back and looked at it and you know, rereading for those of us who use the ordinance all the time, it sort of was like, Oh, of course we're doing it right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when you really look at the ordinance and read it, it's just not well, explained it. So what we've done in your packet tonight and I won't go through and read all the amendments, but we provided for the Council some proposed language in the staff report that basically explains what I just explained, the language that we would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'put into the density bonus ordinance so that everybody would understand that if you're doing a normal project, you know, you just want to come in and get it built tomorrow then. Yeah, of course, all the requirements you have to submit right upfront, if you're doing a phase project through a master plan, well then you can phase it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'under these conditions and only these conditions. And that we've given you some text in your staff report that would essentially clarify that, and we could basically adopt right into the density bonus order. And so there's no confusion about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This in the future. If the council we are recommending that you direct us to do that, we wanted to show you that proposed language in your staff report tonight, and I'm certainly available to answer questions about it tonight, because if you think that's a good idea and that we should do that, then we're recommending that you direct'",
        "'speaker_4': 'us to do it. And what that means is we have to then have public hearings with the planning board under state and local law. All these amendments have to go through a public hearing process so that everybody gets a chance to really think about it, study it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You may think today, oh, that makes good sense, Andrew, but in two or three days go wait a second. I've got a question about that. Well, we would have to have a whole series of hearings before the planning board, and then we'd have to come back to council for final adoption.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're not asking you to adopt it tonight. We're just asking you if you think it it would help solve some of the problems that we had with the Del Monte. And basically, we just want everybody in the committee to really understand how we process projects here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we want to avoid the kind of confusion and second guessing and and just amount of time and energy we spent worrying about whether we had done the process right on, for example, the Del Monte building as we do future projects, because we spent a lot of time talking about these projects and trying to get them right'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And it's always unfortunate when you have that kind of discussion that late in the process. Moratorium. Can we have a moratorium on density bonus applications? The short answer is we then we describe this in the staff work. No, we don't think you can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Once again, it's important to understand state law. Our ability to do a moratorium is strictly regulated by the state, and moratoriums on housing in particular are heavily regulated by the state because once again, the state's like, wait a second, we need housing in this state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last thing we're going to do is have a lot of cities do a little moratoriums on housing. So what is a moratorium? First of all, I just because we even had a speaker last night at the planning board saying, well, we need a moratorium on housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A moratorium is a process by which a city says. We think we have a problem in our regulations that needs to be fixed. And we need to get it fixed quickly. And we have to stop all development that's related to that problem, because until we get it fixed, because it could result in health and safety impacts to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'people. So we're going to put it just basically stop everything to give us time to fix this. And the time is 45 days. Now you can go through a process of extending it for another 45 days. But in our view, it's not worth it or appropriate at this time for a couple of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I said before, state density bond bonus law is established by the state. So even if we did a moratorium, there's I mean, there's just nothing for us to we can't change state law in 45 days, and we certainly can't do a moratorium on local actions to change state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Even if we did a moratorium, it's unclear to us what we would be trying to fix. Number two, you need a 4/5 vote for that to do that. And if it's the planning process, if it's if it's planning for housing that we need to try to fix in 45 days or planning for transportation in 45 days'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we'd have to fix. I can tell you right now we're not going to get that done in 45 days. You're never going to stop planning for housing and you're never going to stop planning for transportation. It is a it is a plans for housing have been going on for well, my knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then look at the history of Alameda. I mean, it's been going on pretty much since the birth of Alameda and transportation planning. And it is is not going to ever end either. It's just something that you will have to do and future councils will have to do and future staffs will have to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm just consistently and constantly. Number two, it's going to be very, very hard to pass muster on the necessary findings that there is a health and safety problem from people proposing end or building affordable housing. I mean, that's essentially what we would have to do is say, look, we have to stop all density bonus applications, which are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it's a remember, it's the whole purpose of density bonus ordinances are to incentivize affordable housing for the state of California. So somehow we'd have to make the argument that we need to stop affordable housing because affordable housing is causing a health and safety problem for all of us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, what I think I'm sure everybody behind me is saying, well, of course, that's not the argument we would make. We would make the argument that traffic delay is a health and safety problem. Well, delay is not a health and safety problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'DeLay is a pain. It's something that makes us all crazy. It's a huge inconvenience, but it is not a health and safety problem. The state of California recently passed a law related to the California Environmental Quality Act. Their basic that that law, SB 743 basically says traffic delay is not an environmental impact at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's going to be very hard to argue that it if it's not even an impact on the environment, it is somehow on health and safety of people. So in a nutshell, we are not recommending that you pursue a moratorium on on affordable housing projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Third question, which is the big one that we really, I think, is really the focus of the rest of the presentation tonight. I'm going to set the stage for for Jennifer. And this is the question that we are constantly asking ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you hear again and again, is our transportation system really ready for more housing? The short answer is no. And what is our plan for housing? And the answer to that is yes. There is a plan. I mean, because there's a lot of folks who are concerned that really the city doesn't have a plan and we're just'",
        "'speaker_4': 'approving everything that walks in the door. Well, that is not the case. Big picture on what is the city's housing plan first and then we can all talk for one or two slides on transportation and stop. The first of all, we have to designated what we call priority development areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are shown on the left slide. They are basically they are designated in this state and the regional plan as to and it's basically our way of telling the regional government, look, this is where new development is going to occur in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's in what is designated the naval air station Alameda Priority Development area, which is alameda point, alameda landing bay port, the old the former naval air station and what we call the northern waterfront priority development area, which is essentially Wind River.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Along the estuary between Clement and the estuary down and including the North Park Street Triangle from Lincoln to the estuary, Tilden. And essentially what we're telling the state of California and and the regional transportation and planning organizations is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, and the rest of the area of Alameda, the blue area, there's really not going to be any new development in that area. I mean, there'll be some maybe a house here or there or maybe some new businesses on Park Street in Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But in terms from a regional perspective, you know, that's those are existing neighborhoods, existing business districts. They're just not going to change very much. And then, of course, Bay from Island is not even on the map, just we'll get we'll do some new businesses in that area, but it's not an area where the region should expect there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be a whole lot of change in Alameda. So with that in mind, then, the map on the right is our. It's from our housing element certified in 2014 and good through 2023 as far as the state of California is concerned.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that shows what we call on for under state law our housing opportunities sites. So what we've told the state of California through our housing element process is that if you want to know where the land is that is zoned to accommodate our housing needs for the next eight years, that's the map.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you can see it's primarily the northern waterfront area along the right hand side of the slide. And then it includes the big site up there, Coast Guard housing and that land. A bunch of it has the slashes, which is the multifamily overlay zoning district provides for enough land for all of our housing that we need to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'provide for the next seven or eight years. Once again, we don't need to build it. We just need to make sure there's land that is available and that's important to the state of California. Is it really land that's available?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Could a private developer go and build housing on that land today if the market was right and they could do a deal with the property owner? And is the city's zoning such that it allows and encourages housing? And they looked at our map and all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, the housing elements more than this map is 200 pages long explaining it all. But that's the kind of the core piece for this discussion. And the housing in the state said, yep, you got it, you're certified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. We'll see you in eight years. Question always comes up. Why is why is army two point not on that map. Because it's a huge housing site. We've been talking all about it. We're working on a project for 800 units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At that time, we did not have the land all from the from from the Navy, and we did not have it zoned right to pieces. And our code was that we said to our army, the point zoning was you need to do a master planning for the residential areas, the town center master plan and the Main Street'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Master Plan was the council recently authorized that we could get started on that until those two things are done. Those lands are not available under the state's rules. So they weren't done when we sent in the housing element before.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they the town center is done now. I just want to explain why allow me to point is not on that map would would the town center qualify as a housing opportunity site today? Absolutely. Would it would the main street qualify as a housing opportunity site?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not today, but once you adopt the main street. A master plan or specific plan, then it would qualify under the state's rules as a, quote unquote, housing opportunity site. So I just wanted to get that on there because I get a lot of questions about why is the map cut off?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why didn't you allow me to point? All right. Traffic. Couple of things about traffic and the first speaker tonight. You know perfect said way to this. Let's first just talk about what is going on with traffic in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A couple important just data points and I tried to use where data is very clear I can reference where it came from. If I didn't have data, then I am going to use a more qualitative thing. So just bear with me here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last 20 years, 1990 to 2010, and I know it's 2015 right now, but census data, the amount of housing in Alameda increased slightly, about 1800 units. We increased our housing supply during 20 years, about 6%. Now, you know, the remember, this is a interesting period because the Navy was here at the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It kind of moved out, didn't have a huge effect housing either one way or the other. But just keep that in mind. Around 1993, there's a major change that in 96 the Navy is starting to move out. They didn't have a ton of housing units on the base anyway, and we're reusing a bunch of them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just keep in mind, I'm not I didn't want a man to think that I was messing with the numbers. So that's census information. That's if you dispute those numbers, you have an issue with the Census Bureau, not with me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda population during that 20 year period actually went down once again census about three not a lot basically stable but it actually went down about three and a half percent. And, you know, there's a lot of reasons for that probably, which we could get into, but that's the fact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's the census data. And so essentially for 20 years, pretty darn stable, not a lot of more people, not a lot more housing, I mean, a little bit more housing, but basically the same number of people. So. What happened to our trips?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What about all those trips the first gentleman was talking about? Oh, my God. The trips. There's so many more vehicles going through the tubes and the bridges. Well, actually not. Those charts right there, not just the last ten years, but you can go back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, going back deeper in 1990, we have it. And I put the tables in to the staff report for just the tubes. The basic point is the number of cars going across the crossings, each one of those lines on the right or a different bridge or the tubes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in the morning, leaving northbound AM commutes, one of those lines is the High Street Bridge. Once the Fruitvale Bridge runs The O.C. to once the whatever the other bridge, you can see, they're all changed a little bit, but generally it's pretty flat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It goes up a little bit and it goes back down again. Volumes have not changed significantly in last 20 years. Not surprising. We got the same number of people. So it's not it's not, you know, rocket science, same coming home at night, the bottom table, all the bridges and tubes, it's pretty flat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not surprising that we don't have more people. Now, next step. Bay Area population during the same period. It is growing a lot, 15%. And the projections for the next 20 years, even, you know, another 20, 30%. So Alameda is stable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oakland. San Francisco. All the communities around us growing. So what is going on? I've been driving into Alameda every day. An out every night for 13 years now. I believe. I totally agree with this gentleman back here. Traffic is worse.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is definitely worse. It's not because there's more cars. It's because it's taking the same number of cars longer to make the trip. Down Park Street, across the crossings and into the regional network, which is getting more congested.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, the more you congest, congest the regional network, the longer it's going to take for. You know, I think of think of getting on a freeway on ramp at midnight. Ten cars can do it really quick.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now think about doing the same on ramp at rush hour where there were the freeways all backed up, ten cars. You just slowly inching onto the freeway. It takes longer. So delay is worse, no doubt about it. And you see it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I see it every morning. I drive luckily in, not out every morning. The line of cars on Park Street is way longer today, every day than it was when I started working here in 2002. No question. The other is a factor, of course, and the other relationship here is housing costs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me just on traffic delay. I don't have numbers. We do not. We we count. Cars and a lot of transportation agencies count cars. That's why I've got all these fancy line graphs. I would like to thank the Public Works Department for their work in gathering data.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have data for the tubes all the way back to the 1990. So I can tell you exactly how many cars went through the tubes. Every year between now and 1990, and it's basically consistent with those things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So but in terms of how long does it actually take to go seven blocks and across and through the tubes? We don't have that information. So I'm going off of just my perceptions of doing it every day and and everyone else's perceptions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't think there's any disagreement about the fact that delay is is worse. Of course, housing prices are also going up. Why is that? Well, the population's getting bigger. More people are competing for a limited supply of housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, in Alameda, the supply of housing has been very, very stable. So population goes up, more demand for housing. What does that mean? Housing prices go up. People, as housing prices go up, fewer people can afford to buy houses need to rent more pressure on the rental market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The rental supply rents go up. Do I have the I can't point to specific numbers and I'm sure we can do lots of studies and to support that. But there is definitely a correlation and that those correlations are being documented throughout a number of urban areas, including the San Francisco Bay area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. So enough with that lecture. What about what's coming? So it's been very stable, but. What is there is change coming. So this is a table that looks at the next basically I cut it off at 2023 because that's our that's our housing element planning process.'",
        "'speaker_4': '2015 is our first year to this year is the first year of our housing element cycle. Our eight year cycle ends in 2023. Every project that is today under construction today approved or is in our pipeline. What I mean about pipeline is I've got an application downstairs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, it hasn't come to a public hearing yet, but it will. And so I've just for that and it's a housing element site, so I'm just assuming it may not get approved or they might just drop out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, if the economy tanks tomorrow, many of these projects will not happen. But let's assume the economy stay strong. Housing demand stays strong for the next eight years. You can I would bet you that this projection is probably pretty darn close.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I've done is and what with not me personally, but with the help of the rest of the staff is sort of put through. And and the developers who are working on these things just put together this sort of schedule.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you can see at the bottom when you add up the projects where, you know, each year at the bottom total, like how many new units will come online each year roughly. And once again, if the economy changes or if it goes down, it economy goes down, then these numbers will go down or spread out over a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'longer period of years. If the economy all of a sudden ramps up, you're probably not going to see a big change in this because as you see, a lot of these projects like Alameda Landing, I mean, we originally approved around me landing in 2006.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, a lot of these things take time. The Del Monte hearings, if everything goes smooth as silk, we might see the first 75 units two years from now. But, you know, so just. Take it with what? I just want to make sure I understood what it was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at the end of the day, what does it mean? 1841 new housing units at the end of our cycle. So what does that mean? That's a lot of units, especially for a community that's pretty darn stable. Well, it means that basically a 6% increase in our housing stock.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, we don't have a lot of housing in Alameda, so that's all. But we you know, we're a pretty big city. That's a 6% increase. It's also roughly a and assuming average household size for the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Average vacancy rates for the city of Alameda. Those two factors are coming from the census. I just used those and just assumed those. That would roughly be a 6% increase in the overall population from 2010. Two things. We will definitely meet our arena numbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, the state of California should come down here and give us a big pat on the back, because not only did we make the land available, but the units actually got built and. Hopefully and this is not making any promises here, it should have a beneficial effect on the issue of rising rents because we have provided'",
        "'speaker_4': 'more supply into our system at a variety of sizes. A much of this housing, with the exception of Alameda Landing, which is sort of 5050, is multifamily housing. So hopefully provide more entry level options in multifamily buildings for first time buyers, buyers at the lower end of the economic spectrum, which will hopefully open up some of the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the rental market as those people move out of the rental market and into the homeownership market. All right. So what does that do to our transportation system, which I already said is, you know, we we are nobody is going to tell you, oh, our transportation system is fine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not fine. We have to get it better. We are working to make it better. So what's our big picture strategy? Jennifer is going to talk a lot about transportation. I'm just going to hit on some big picture concepts here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to improve our transportation system because the Bay Area is growing around us faster than we are. It's affecting our transportation system more than our own development is because we it's it's been it's affected us in the last 20 years with very little development in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is in our future, in our units. It's going to affect the transportation system, no question. But even if that wasn't going to happen, our transportation system would still be impacted by the growth around us. So what do we have to do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have to make the transportation system better for everybody in Alameda. We can't just focus on the 6% of the new residents. And this is where I got off base with Councilmember De Saag at that hearing. He was asking very good questions about the TDM program and I was going off in a different direction and getting frustrated'",
        "'speaker_4': '. What was really going through my mind is we can't focus on the 6% new residents and whether they are going to ride transit. I mean, we should. Absolutely. But the answer to the transportation problem is transportation systems that work for all of us because we have got to serve, create transportation that works for every resident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we only have 6% of the population using transportation, we have a big problem and it's not going to solve the problem in the long term. So we have to build and plan transportation for everyone, not just the little teams all working on number two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's another big part of the transportation strategy is, yeah, let's comply with state law. We are shooting ourselves in the foot if we get out of sync with state law on the housing element stuff, because we need to get the state money from the state and be able to apply for those funds for parks and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let's not cut that funding source off. I mean, transportation is all about money. We need money to build these systems and run these systems. Number two, those new projects, let's look at them as part of the solution, not the problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're they're only contributing 6% of the problem. Let's soak them as much as we can for the solution. So let's make sure that every new development funds provides us money in upfront capital improvements and on an annual basis for transportation services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's what our TDM programs are really focused on is and you know, how do we get money out of those developments upfront and annually to help fund transportation? Number two, transit oriented. The next is transit oriented design.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's make sure that every single new project I don't care if it's 1%, 2%, 6%, it has to be designed so that it uses transit. Because if we design projects that rely on automobile use, we're shooting ourselves in the foot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we have to do everything we can. And your planning board does a great job of pushing that issue, those last those last two very, very hard. And then we have to build partnerships and we are doing that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And Jennifer is going to talk a lot of that. But we have to we are working with AC Transit and we always have, not just as of December. I mean, we have a long term relationship with AC transit and they are looking at expanded services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are working constantly with Wheeler on expands, expanded ferry services. And Jennifer, we'll talk a little bit about that. We are also working with part is probably kind of pushing it it's we are actively have been talking to Bart for years about hey what about us we pay in to the BART system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need access, direct access to BART. The little drawing at the top is a from a presentation we did. Gosh that's from. Seven or eight years ago when the original idea of an estuary BART crossing a BART station was was developed in the context of any point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a very interesting and creative solution where you build one BART station, it's literally under the estuary and it serves both Jack London Square and and Alameda. Look, I'm not up here promising you that you're gonna get a BART station in the next year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It ain't going to happen in years, but these things take many years. And Alameda needs to stay at the table for that discussion. And then, of course, the TMS, you know, we with every project that we build and this is not just recently I mean, the Wind River campus was approved in 12 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was 13, 13 or 14 years ago. That was before I even started working here. The council at that point, some of you may have rank. You may have been on it. You guys required that they pay money to transit for every employee every year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're funding the they're helping fund the cross estuary shuttle today. So this council, this community has been thinking along these lines long before I got here, and we just have continued that. So we think the building blocks are in place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One more, I think, and I can be quiet. Oh, last one. So we hear this. What are people going to use? The Andrew Nobody driver uses transit. We all drive. I hear this all the time. We are in California, Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nobody uses busses. We all drive. We, you know, stop this sort of crazy talk about transit. Well, I disagree that the transportation system and the Bay Area is going to continue to evolve and grow. I mean, and I think the numbers support that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ferry service out of Alameda has in the last two years the main street ferry terminal. Ridership is up 39% in two years. Harbor Bay. 24% in two years. You read about Bart there ridership. I mean, it's on in the chronicle pretty much once every two weeks about their ridership and how their system is packed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'AC Transit is doing great and the and the Alameda County residents passed Measure B, if there's not a, you know, a way of example that people in in the region are saying we need better transit, we're willing to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Measure B B is that is is that confirmation 2010 Harbor Bay Business Park starts running shuttles for their employees and it's going strong in the Harbor Bay Business Park connects Coliseum BART all the way through the business park all the way to the ferry service.'",
        "'speaker_4': '2012 Gale pain here in the public works department and the city council will get the cross estuary shuttle going going from BART into west Alameda College of Alameda out to wind river and back. 2013 alameda landing in the west.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda, TMA starts its shuttle services from oakland BART through the tubes to Alameda landing and is also designed to expand West me to point 2014 marina village starts its shuttle. We didn't even ask them to. They were just like, we're starting a shuttle because our people who want to the way to fill marina villages too and get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those offices filled by providing transportation services, that's how we're going to bring jobs to Alameda is by bringing transit to Marina Village first, so they go and start their own shuttle service. We as I said, we are we are collecting on an annual basis for every new unit in the northern waterfront, between 350, 350 and foreign, $50'",
        "'speaker_4': 'per unit every year. That's money going into a part to help us create a funding source for supplemental shuttle services, bus services, helping AC transit, whatever that money can be used for, to build better transportation. And of course, you've probably you know, but for the folks behind me who may not know the the negotiations that Jennifer is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'doing with Alameda Point, you know, those include the building of money for a new ferry terminal so that the Water Emergency Transit Association can provide ferry service not just to Main Street, but also the Sea Point Lagoon. And of course, our BRT and bus lanes between Alameda point directly through to the tubes in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think the future is bright, frankly, for transportation, but we still have a lot of work to do. It's this is not done. This is as my message is, we just need to keep going. Oh, I couldn't resist.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda in traffic. This is I mean, we're an island. This is what makes Alameda, like, so great. I mean, I've worked in a lot of Bay Area cities and every single one of them struggles with with transportation. Your situation, you're only just such a beautiful city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's because of the island geography. From a transportation. I mean, your general plan. When I first started working, I opened up general plans. The very first thing it says, it's like, you know, preserve and maintain the island character of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, it's it's the most fundamental thing about this city is it's island geography from a transportation standpoint. It's a blessing. In Berkeley, where I worked in Oakland, I work traffic is really bad. And a big part of it is because there are so many regional travelers who are basically just moving through those cities, just traffic moving'",
        "'speaker_4': 'through Berkeley is I mean, think about Ashby Avenue in Berkeley. It's not Berkeley residents going to Berkeley. That's people coming from the East Valley, you know, Eastern communities through cutting through Berkeley to get to 880 and onwards. So all those communities I've worked in have got a huge problem with just traffic moving through their cities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda doesn't have that. It's once you're on the island, it's if there's traffic, it's just us creating the traffic. But it's also our biggest challenge, right? We only got four bridges. And this is not a challenge that just happened in the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is a photograph that Greg McFadden, the chief building official, has in his office. It's like Alameda in 1935. That red line I put, you can't see it. But go down to Greg's office. Check it out. That's a line of cars trying to get through the posi tubes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's backed up to Bueno Vista. I mean, it's. It's just the nature of living on an island. We are. I'm not saying it's a good thing. I'm not saying we don't need to worry about it, but it's just it's it's not going to go away.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're always going to have to deal with it. We're always going have to plan for it. We're going to have to work with it. But I think when people say, you know, we're an island, we have we can't we have to be realistic about traffic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, yeah, it's just it's it is just. It's also what makes Alameda so great. So, you know, I just we can work with it and keep planning for transportation. All right. I've talked too much. Art made our recommendation on my piece of this record.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of this proposal is essentially to part. Yes, absolutely. We think we can improve the density bonus ordinance with those amendments. We think you should direct us to proceed with those. And we will, if with your direction, recommend those to the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We may have. There's also some recent changes to state density bonus about affordable housing tenure and things, which we should probably also get into our ordinance as we go through that process with the planning board, I'm sure the Alameda community and others will point out a number of other things we can do to clean up the ordinance'",
        "'speaker_4': ', make it more readable, make it more understandable. And as with every ordinance, you know, now we have six years of use under our belt. You know, we can all look at it and go, you know, this worked well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That didn't work well. We should clarify that. So we think that would be a healthy process and a process worth doing if you agree. And then of course, generally, yeah, direct staff to pursue additional transportation planning. And I'll let Jennifer talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But and she's really her presentation is all about that second piece. So with that I will finish my presentation. And as I said at the beginning, we can it's really up to you, Madam Mayor. If you want to stop here and have questions, take public comment, deal with the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Up to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have quite a few speakers. We say 1 to 3 or five speakers on this item as opposed to the next item. There's three on the next item rather than. So I would propose that we take clarifying questions on this first piece, allow the speakers to speak on the first piece, and then we can decide if we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'want to do the next presentation before we make any recommendations. Council Or are you agreeable to that? Starting with clarifying questions on this piece.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do we need a motion for that? Is that like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, we can just kind of just plan to do that then. All right. So we'll proceed with clarifying questions. At this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Thomas. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm billable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi there. And just for the sake of disclosure, I actually emailed these questions to Mr. Thomas and Mr. and I think Mr. Heine from Public Works was in on some of the responses. But looking at your staff report, page 11, you talk about the need to have a conversation about the possibility of bringing BART to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And my question was, how and when do you see that happening?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think our the really we have been in communications with BART for years on on really in the context of Alameda point was really the main driver as those diagrams I showed or from five or six years ago where we were working and really what what started to occur back then was this sort of informal partnership'",
        "'speaker_4': 'between Alameda and Jack London Square back then. And Square was saying, yeah, we're we want to be at that table with you because and maybe there's an alliance here between Jacqueline Square in Alameda where we want we would like BART to do an extension down to Jacqueline and square.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, if they get down to Jacqueline Square, then there and we were like, oh, you know what? Well, let's talk about that. And we had we were having meetings with Bart and we were it was Bart and Jacqueline and Oakland and Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they were saying and I was there at that point, I was sort of the point person. I was like, Yeah, well, you're going to come down to Jacqueline Square. I have a station there. Then we want you to come just a little bit further and have a station somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in in Alameda, that's when BART came up with the idea of the estuary station serving both. That conversation has been sort of going in a low simmer for years. And then recently the, you know, really BART and their increasing ridership their understanding for the need for a second crossing San Francisco and mayor Ed Lee saying I'",
        "'speaker_4': 'want to push this issue really has heated up the conversation at a at the regional level. And I think from staff's perspective, we think this is a conversation that the city of Alameda should be involved in. We don't think we're a driver in this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean that let's face it, Alameda is just not a big driver in the region. San Francisco is the big driver. Oakland is somewhat of a big driver. But we just think that Alameda should make it clear up front and participate throughout the process, which is probably a ten or 15 year process if we are in agreement'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that this is something that is good for alameda access to bart, you know, where the actual station is located is doesn't have to be figured out right now. What I think would be the mistake would be for Alameda not to participate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when I say participate, I'm not talking about a huge investment in staff, resources or studies. Just be at the table when these regional conversations go on. Just keep reminding the region, yes, this is something we support. It's something we want.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What you don't want to be in these regional transportation situations, especially in these long ten, 15, 20 year, you know, billion dollar transportation things which affect the whole region. What you do not want to do is be the city, the little city who comes in at the last minute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Has not participated all and says, whoa, whoa, whoa, you forgot about us. And then everybody's like, Hey, too late, man. You should have been here ten years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just to the mechanics of my question, so how would that question come back to the city council?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I think I think it's something we should follow if it's something that the council would like to get an update on. I think right now the point person for the city has been public works and and you know Payne is here and she can maybe help me out that you have to look of I could help'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Yeah. I just spoke to Gail Payne, transportation coordinator. I just spoke to Ellen Smith of BART Staff and they are interested in coming to city council. They're looking at May 17 as providing a briefing. If that works. So we're working it out with staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And my second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My second. It's kind of a two part, but I think shorter question was then on page 12 of the staff report we talk about. With the passage of measure, BP City is in ongoing discussions with AC Transit on a plan to expand AC transit service throughout Alameda, including bus rapid transit between Seaplane Lagoon Ferry and downtown Oakland'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And my question was, we need to know or I would like to know. I think we all need to know the time frame for expanding AC transit service. When will we see this improvement? Hold that thought in mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a different maybe related question is, is there a way for the three West End shuttles to be consolidated to offer more frequent and expanded service? Because right now we have the estuary crossings shuttle, we have Marina Village and we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Target. There's another one in there too, though. But I'm going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyway, I think there's some some redundancy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me defer if you if it's okay with you, let me defer. I think it'll be good to defer the to transportation you're next to. Let's have the. Okay. If it's okay. We do have a reference here from AC Transit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perfect. Jennifer has a presentation on transportation. She's going to cover a lot of this. And then if that's okay, that's okay. Thank you. Probably the least qualified answer of the three of us. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other clarifying questions from Councilmembers and Brody?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just had a few. Thank you, Andrea, for your presentation. So kind of a follow up from Councilmember Ashcroft. Question the shuttles you mentioned on page 11 and 12 of the staff report. Is it possible to get some data on the ridership of those shuttles?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I didn't see it in there. But it might be helpful for the community to know and for us to know well what they started out where they're at now. And then they kind of go back to the the density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You mentioned that in the process of approving the Del Monte phases, we have discretion to enforce the various provisions of affordable housing. Can you kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on those?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what we do with master plans and this is true of Del Monte, I'll use Del Monte is example, but it's what I'm about to say is true of all of our master plans. And we have master plans for Alameda Landing, Del Monte, Marina Village, Bay Farm Island.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's it's a process that's that's been used for years here in Alameda, a big mixed use project that take many years. So what the master plan does is it establishes the the the sort of the global requirements, total number of housing units, total number of of, you know, at the breakdown of of very low, low moderate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the location of it when it would be phased in over the project's ten or 15 year in, you know. And so so we basically know when we're getting the housing what what levels of affordability would be, how many units and we know when it will come into the project then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But what we don't have is we don't have. The developer is trying to figure out, all right, what's the big plan for the entire area? It could be ten, 15, 20. Del Monte was 11 acres. You know, allow me to point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ten times that. And then when we say it's okay, you know, they haven't designed every single building yet. They don't have the architecture for every single building, some buildings not built for five or ten years. So basically what our master plan say is all right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When you're ready to build the very first building. You bring it in the city hall and we're going to have a public hearing about the design of that building, and we are going to review it for a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One is against the requirements of the master plan that we adopted. So if it's your phase one building and the master plan says Phase one building needs 15 affordable housing units, then, well, that's we're not going to approve the architecture and the design of that first building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If it doesn't have those 15 affordable housing units, it whatever the master plan says you're going to do, you better do it. And then there's other things. But we also will allow us to say, you know. You know that architectural design.'",
        "'speaker_4': '15 years ago, when we approved the master plan, we might have thought it was okay, but today we don't. Because now we want solar panels, we want, you know, we just have a different esthetic or we have a different thought about these things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it gives the city the ability just to to. To enforce those new those new esthetics, those new concerns with each phase of the project. So, you know, that's that's a that's essentially the gist of I answer your question was that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And then so so that's I mean, just just add one more. So under the density bonus audience that says, well, with the building, we need to see the floor plans of every affordable unit. Well, the master plan says, well, the very first building you're going to when you come in, we're going to want 15, 15 affordable'",
        "'speaker_4': 'units in that building, which let's say it's 100 units total. 15 are going to be affordable. We look at the floor plans like, you know, so three years later it comes in, we look at it, I'm like, wait.'",
        "'speaker_4': '15 units are 15 little closet spaces, and the other 85 are these big three bedroom thing. No, because the master plan says this. The the the affordable has to be comparable to the market rate. So we're like, no, that's not going to work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't need to have those four plans on day one, as we have reserved the ability to say no. And year three when they come in, you know, like it, we say, no, they don't get a building permit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Project stops.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then my other question. Maybe this is too far for you to predict what happens in 2023.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So here's what's going to happen in 2022 of 2020. Yeah. I mean, here's what's happening. The state of California is going to do a new projection for the state. And they're going to say and this is what happens every cycle, just before the cycle ends, the of the state's going to say, all right, what's our housing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'need for the next eight years? They're going to come up with a big number all there, and then they're going to divide it between the regions. So let's say it's whatever it is, a million housing units. And then they're going to take the the planners in Sacramento are going to say, okay, of the million, a quarter quarter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'million has to be provided to the Bay Area. So they send the the air bag, which is our regional government, that number, they say, okay, the Bay Area needs to provide a quarter of a million housing units over the next eight years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then a bag has the awful job of getting all the cities together and coming up with a process to decide, okay, we as a region need a quarter of a million housing units. How are we going to divide those up among the various cities?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that has historically been it's a very what impact does they create? Policies which they all agree to first and then their planners try to split it. And then there's a lot of arm wrestling back and forth. And at the end of the day, each city kind of goes away, grumbling, because it's too much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And a bag gets all the blame. And we all blame a bag, but a bag. And here's the problem. The way the whole system is set up, if I go to a bag and I've been doing this for my entire career, for every city I work with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Too much. Too much. We can't accommodate that many housing units for usually traffic reasons. The problem with a bag has as well, they basically look right back and say, all right, well, talk to one of your other fellow cities, you know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, okay. And take your units in a day bag. Just needs to distribute the quarter million what what the state does not a lousy bag and say oh you know what a bunch of our cities said they couldn't accommodate this so we've got 100,000 too many.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're sending them back to you. The state give them to another region. You know, it's so then last piece. So let's say our next allocation is another 1700. Let's just say. We don't need to find. So now we have to identify to the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where is the land that we're going to put 17 housing units on? It doesn't have to be a new set of sights. If if Coast Guard housing, which was on that map, is still not developed because it's a Navy property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we all know that things take a long time for the Navy. It may not is maybe still vacant. Well, then I get to when I'm doing the new housing element for you and when you adopt that, let's say you're all here in 2023, that site will still be on the list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I get to tell the state of California it's available. It's still available. Yeah, we used it last cycle. It was available then. It's still available. So it doesn't mean that we can't reuse sites now. Of course, if we got housing built on there, you know, Del Monte, let's say it's all the residents who moved in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't use that site. So that's essentially how the process works.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And by then we'll probably have more. SpaceX on Alameda Point that meets the well, I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. No, I think that in terms of long range planning it's something to think about is yeah I mean you know how do we manage the flow right now? We've got a hot economy. Lots coming in. And so I kind of build more housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Go, go, go pressures. But, you know, we've got to be thinking about managing it over time. But if we are an island, I mean, we are not going to create more land.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is suddenly the economy tanks in the 1800 that's on that list. Never get built. We could reuse that 1800.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There still aren't still available. Right. That's the basic. The concept. Is it available? Yeah. That's still vacant. Still available. Some developer can come in and build on it. Great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guess kind of I think I heard this in your report, but I just want to. Be clear on this one point. Can the city council legally address traffic by limiting or banning additional housing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. And. No, I mean here. Well, here's the what's I mean, I guess I should I'll give a banner response real quick. Here's the problem. You are immediately going to go out of compliance with state law. So technically, I guess you could you just then you have to deal with the consequences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just to confirm that, no, we cannot. I think, as Andrew did point out in the presentation, we cannot state law does not allow us to use traffic as a means to get out of addressing our housing element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They've even clamped down more on secret processes, saying that transportation was not something that even was to be considered as an environmental impact. And as far as the potential for a moratorium, which I know is on the table, too, that you all asked us to look at the issue very much is there are two two different kinds'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of moratoriums. One is an interim 45 day moratorium that has what I will call lesser findings that have to be made, because it's for a very short period of time, only 45 days. We frankly don't even think we could qualify for a 45 day moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But beyond that 45 days, if we wanted to extend it beyond that period, which could be extended up to potentially two years, the requirements that are made that have to be made for findings to be able to justify a moratorium are very, very severe and they do not include traffic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to reiterate, one of the things that Andrew mentioned, we often hear the term public health, safety and welfare when we talk about things that cities are justified in regulating based on public health, safety and welfare. Much of the planning zoning traffic rules are based on welfare.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What the moratorium rules require is that you focus instead on public health and safety, and they take away the ability to look at that welfare category. So the kinds of the type of thing, to give an example that could potentially justify a moratorium to try to solve some housing issues, traffic issues would have you really get two'",
        "'speaker_0': 'things, like if you didn't have a water source, if all of a sudden there was no capacity to service water for additional housing, and frankly, they ran into that issue in the not so distant past in Gilroy and Hollister area where they had to put a moratorium on because they had a water issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That kind of thing is then a public health and safety issue. Traffic is not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if I can just elaborate on that, just a few more questions and try to say this in a delicate way, if I mean. Is that a political question? Answer or if someone else was sitting in that city attorney's spot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, would they tell us the same thing? I know that it's kind of an indelicate way to answer it or ask the question, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, let me just try to answer it this way, if I may, and hopefully I'm answering your question. First of all, the city attorney for any city is required to have experience in municipal law. Many people are lawyers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, you. Councilmember Odierno or a lawyer. The mayor is a lawyer. Councilmember Ashcraft are lawyers. We have many lawyers in the audience. I've spent my life dealing with lots of lawyers in a lot of different functions. You can do it kind of akin to a doctors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are a lot of doctors out there, but they're specialists. And if you're going to have heart surgery, at least if I'm going to have heart surgery, I'm not going to a podiatrist. I'm going to go to a cardiologist.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the same is true with law. And for a person to serve as a city attorney, you have to have experience in municipal law. And not to sound egotistical here, but my own personal circumstances. You all know I was appointed by the last city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I have talked with all of you as I have been practicing law since 1984, since 1998, in municipal law in the San Francisco Bay area, in San Jose, Morgan Hill. And here I have four lawyers who work for me in my office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have all practiced in municipal law in Northern California for a minimum of 15 years. We have people that we talk with all the time throughout the State, League of Cities, whatever. So we are very well-versed in municipal law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're not trust in the state lawyers. We're not various and sundry other types. We are municipal lawyers. So if I am not sitting in this seat, my assumption is the person you appoint would also have a similar level of experience.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that person is going to give you the same advice because that is just what the law is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that is that law going to be interpreted differently if we have a different city manager? I mean, and if you suddenly we tell the public we can't legally address this and they decide they're going to throw us all out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, could that new council still I mean, is it going to be the same no matter what? I guess that's kind of my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my answer is yes. I mean, the council might like a different answer. The council might give direction to try. I mean, there could be a lawsuit. Somebody could bring the claim, this is America, you're allowed to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the law is is the law. And no matter who's sitting there, who's defending the city or who's who's pursuing an issue for the city, they have to deal with the law. The current city manager, as you all know, is also a lawyer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And he actually has served in a municipal law capacity. But he also is quite careful that in his role as city manager, he's the city manager. He's not the city attorney and he's not giving the city legal advice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The person per our charter who gives the city legal advice is the city attorney. And so the law isn't going to change based on who the city manager is, who the city council members are. Frankly, it is the law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we do our best in using our expertize to best interpret, defend, advise the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other council member clarifying questions. I have a questions now. Thank you, Sir Thomas. Does when we have a long project. For instance, the Domani you had said that it's not necessary to have a floor plan for the units for the approval, initial approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What about the location of where the affordable housing units will be within the project?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. I mean, typically what we have done on every master plan and we did this with Del Monte, we identified when the affordable housing would be built in each phase and where those phases are. So every master plan you look in that we've done, whether it's Del Monte or others, you can read it and you can see'",
        "'speaker_4': ', Oh, we know how this is going to get developed and where and what we did in Del Monte. We specified exactly where the affordable housing would go and if certain situations occurred where the council decided not to do at some future date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If council said no to one scenario, then where it would shift, it's sort of plan B. So we tried to lay that out so that anybody who read the master plan up front would have a pretty good idea of exactly what they would know for sure how many units and the general location of those units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And what about Measure A? How does that sound alive right now in Alameda? Yes, it is being applied.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, sir.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm sorry. I just wanted to share. So my. And what is your understanding of what Measure eight provides?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, let me tell you what Measure A does. And it's there's something beautiful about measure. It's only one sentence long. There shall be no multifamily housing built in Alameda. That's what it says. That's what the voters adopted in 1972.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there the Alameda Municipal Code was then amended by the City Council. Time to define multifamily housing, which says you shall not build anything more than two units in one building because more than that is defined as multifamily.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our charter says no multifamily housing. So here's the problem. State law says every city shall provide lands, designate some lands. Doesn't have to be every inch. You have to provide some land for multi-family housing. You cannot prohibit it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here is the distinction. What state law is saying is, look. Single family zoning is fine. Every city in the Bay Area has got some. So even San Francisco has some single family zoning issues. You can't cover your entire city in single family zoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, boom, we have a conflict. State law says you need at least some land zoned for multi-family housing. Measure says not one inch. So we have a problem. And when there's a problem between state law, which is up here and city law which is down here, state law always wins.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You cannot win that fight. So what do we do? First thing we do. And this was I mean, this is all laid out. The state laid it out for us in 2006 was a letter that was 15 pages long about everything that's wrong with the with our land use laws in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it took us six years to fix it all. And in 2012, we finally finished and the state said, good job, you're certified. It started with density bonus law. So the first thing we did in 2009 and there's a whole bunch of other things too, is this letter was 12 pages long and it was filled with everything'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Our second unit ordinance was screwed up. I mean, all this stuff was out of Kansas, but the big ones on Missouri first density bonus law. So what state density bonus law says is, as I described, you'll give these bonuses additional units for projects of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, so far, no problem. No problem. No. No problem with that in Missouri. But what state law says is. And the whole concept of state law. Think of it this way. The states saying, look, if a developer comes to you, Mr. Planner Andrew, and says, I'm going to do I'm going to give the city of Alameda some'",
        "'speaker_4': 'affordable housing units. Then you have to say thank you, Mr. Developer, because the state needs it. And if the developer says and to make it viable, I need a couple of things. I need some additional units. To make to help pay for those affordable units on top of what your zoning allows.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what bonus units are. Then you, Andrew, or your body, your planning board or your council will say yes and the ratios are all spelled out. So that's okay. So far so good. No problem. One more thing about density bonus law, state test and Belper comes to you says I'm giving you affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then they say, I want bonus units, another 15 units. I say, okay, you can have it. But local guy Andrew is really doesn't want the project bill because it's too dense. And I say to the developer, Oh, that's a shame.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You can't fit those additional ten units. We have a height limit or we have some other development standard. Oh, you need. You can't fit the additional ten units in single family homes. That's too bad. I'm not giving you a variance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Aha. Too bad. Yes. You're not going to build those extra units, are you? State law goes no city. Developer. If that's a problem, developer says I need a waiver, not a variance, a waiver. You must waive that requirement if your requirement is making it is physically prohibiting them from being able to fit the units on the property'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And so that was the first place where the city to rectify these, to provide some flexibility within the confines. So if the straight answer to your question is measure so applies to the whole city, with a few exceptions, but anybody on any property that can do that can apply for density bonus, which means your property has to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be big enough to allow at least ten units, which means most properties need to be about 10,000 square feet. So if you own a home anyway back there with 5000 square feet, don't get any ideas, it's not going to work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if you have a big property, you can then say, Hey, we'll measure the two unit. Part of your zoning code is preventing me from fitting so they can ask for a waiver from the to unit the multifamily prohibition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's where most of those projects that are multifamily that we have approved have used that waiver. Then the second piece, the multifamily overlay zone, this is where it's just very direct and very upfront. State law says you want a housing element certified, you need a city law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'State law says you shall define not where you might waive it. If they do these things, you just have to there has to be enough. Some land in your city that was permitted by. Right. That's the law in California.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So show us where that is. That's when we came up in 2012 with the multifamily overlay, district zoning. It's a zoning district. We applied it to a handful of sites approximately. When you add up the acreage of all those sites, it's about 1% of the entire land area of Alameda, 1%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was enough for the state. So, you know, the Del Monte site and small terminals like if we need, we can go back to that slide. It shows the little slash sites. Those are the sites where in 2012, the council said state law says we have to do this, we're going to do it to get into'",
        "'speaker_4': 'compliance with state law. They approved the multifamily overlay district. We don't need to go back to the voters to amend measure to do this. We're required to do it by state law. So even if we went back to the voters and said, hey, we want to do this, and the voters said, no, it wouldn't have changed anything'",
        "'speaker_4': ', we still had to do it. So that's where we have the multifamily overlays permit on those 1% of the city's property permit multifamily housing. By right now, you start to go through the approval process and everything like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that's where Measure A and our zoning code disagree. But basically misery for the other 99% of the property. It still applies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Sorry. I'm Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. And a follow up now that the door's been open on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of us like Missouri, you know, we think it's protected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's done great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Neighborhoods. You know, and if you knock on doors on Regent Street or some of those neighborhoods and you see, you know, the multi-unit buildings and then you see the beautiful touring homes next to them. You know, for those of us that weren't here in 1972, you know, you can easily see why it's there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So maybe this is a legal question as well, but the prospect of litigation and consequences if we don't follow the law. I can put it out there. What happens to measure a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I, I put it out there in 2012. It's probably still on the city website. I don't know how far back those presentations go, but I mean, I stood right here and basically made this argument, you need to adopt this multifamily overlay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, we had a lawsuit pending go. We do not want to go down the Pleasanton route. I mean, the worst the worst scenario for the council in 2012 was not doing it. Getting the lawsuit and measure being found invalid by a court.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The wipe is wipes it out for the whole city. What the council did in 2012 is, is like we're going to, you know, using the doctor thing. It's like we're doing this very careful 1% incision into the patient to cure the problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if the patient says, Oh my God, I don't want the 1% incision. Well, you may die patient, too, so you should do it. And, you know, I think the multifamily overlay saves measure for the other 99%. You take away the multifamily overlay, and I'm not the attorney and I won't give you legal advice here in front'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of everybody, then you shouldn't take it from me. But as a planner, take away the multifamily overlay. I think measure is its days are numbered and I would agree. Woody Minor did a presentation in 2007 on the history of Measure for a big workshop we had on Measure A.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We should have him come back and do it again. I mean. That's when I understood Measure eight when he talked about the history of it. And it's it's a it's of measure he's done great things for the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is that the legal I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And let me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just because I think this is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Important. Yes. So my office did put out a background memorandum on legislative history, which tries to also put shed some light on how this works. But without going too deeply into this, the reason that in Alameda we can have measures on the books at all is because we're a charter city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, again, unlike school districts and other counties and other people who are totally creatures of state law, the way the state constitution works is they allow for charter cities, letting the power go as close to the people as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so as a charter city, we are able to control a lot of our own destiny on local matters. And only when the state comes along, which has been pointed out, is at a higher level in the food chain than the city is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the state determines that there is a matter of statewide importance. Then it can preempt the city, even in its charter role, from being able to take some particular actions, some kind of governance. So Measure was adopted as part of our charter, which was the city standing up and voting and saying, this is important to our city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for all the reasons that you just mentioned, Councilmember Odie and we all very much appreciate and I believe the charter is very important to us and do not lightly ever, ever give up on our charter rights as opposed to something that would be in state law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That I think is it's been made very clear to you here the density bonus and affordable housing the state has made incredibly clear and courts have made incredibly clear, have been determined to be measures of statewide concern. And so in those matters, we have to follow the state law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have no choice. We will be in violation of the state law. And just like you heard about the city of Pleasanton, who didn't get a housing element adopted, they found themselves having to take their zoning decisions to a court.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They paid over $1,000,000. They couldn't get state funding. They had a horrific problem. So we don't want to go there. And so instead, what we have done and what my predecessors have done before I got here is when certain issues came up like this one, where we have to comply with state law and we know we will'",
        "'speaker_0': 'lose. And in fact, on Measure I, we did lose. Then we what we're doing is what Andrew explain is what we're doing is we're really reading measure A to maintain measure to the fullest extent, but reconciling it with what is required under state law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is why we have said we will approve the waivers. We have explained this to the public publicly. And to date, no one has challenged us. Now, frankly, in the East Bay Regional Park District lawsuit on the Neptune Point Crab Cove matter, they did challenge it, but that case was dismissed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the matter was never determined by a court. So we have been successful to date in protecting measure to the fullest extent possible. But we if somebody sues us, we will have to defend and frankly, we will lose if we do not comply with state the state density bonus laws and the state affordable housing laws.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we would risk having a court set aside the entirety of Measure A rather than doing it the way we have been.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. At this point, we have 13 steps. We're going to start with Darcy Morrison and Paul Foreman and then Laura Thomas. I. Can you hear me okay? First, I'm concerned with the very pro-development tone of the staff report and in particular, the contention that a low lying island like Alameda should welcome development in the face of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'global warming. On the contrary, a low lying island is the worst possible place to concentrate development at this point, and especially on sites that are barely above sea level. In an unbiased world, this makes no sense, and it's even more unwise given our approximate proximity to a major fault zone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if the environment is really the issue here, then where is the concern for our regional water supply? Something which seldom gets mentioned by anyone. I see the references to millions more in population, but I don't see anything about water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It looks like half baked bureaucratic thinking with tedium. I think there's a real danger of obscuring the larger issues. Tedium might mitigate 10% or even 30% of the traffic generated by development. That leaves us with 70% or more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not being discussed in any real sense. It's as if TDM were a cure all and it isn't. I want to see a discussion on that other 70% in honest terms. How much more traffic? How much predictable delay?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to see an analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions caused by delays at the crossings. I don't think we'll see any real reduction even with TDM in place and I'd like to see how this looks in the long term as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to see a public opinion survey survey conducted also on commuting habits in particular and the real world alternatives the average commuter might consider. This would be an honest survey, not an essay on smart growth and planning efforts we've seen, or to top down and make too many assumptions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's go out and ask people whether any form of transit would be workable for them and under what circumstances. Then see how that drives with transit proposals. Let's ask them to how they feel about bus, rapid transit and dedicated bus lanes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The survey should be overseen by a council subcommittee in our city staff. We need something which everyone views as neutral and unbiased. And finally, I wonder whether we have any real regulations on development left. The Council needs to put a stop to unexplained waivers outside the scope of the density bonus or anything else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a very reasonable expectation, and I hope you will consider it. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. You know, I totally agree with what the city planner said. He shocked city attorney who said a moratorium, in my view, is downright illegal. I do not think any serious amendments are needed for density bonus except the one for phase project because it allows you to do what you did without authority before in my opinion'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And that is a hold off on the, on the design part of the of the affordable housing. The there's nothing wrong with the state housing element law. There's nothing wrong with the density bonus law. There's nothing basically wrong with multifamily.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This special multifamily overlay zoning idea. What's wrong is the number of properties they have allocated for multifamily zoning. Because you're talking about 30 units per acre. Under that zoning, which is the normal for Allen meters 21. The density bonus ordinance does density bonus law does not require 30 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It doesn't have any baseline. So to get it. Mr. matter Ricci's problem with density. If you can stick to the 21 instead of the 30, then you're building the density bonus on 21 or on 30. So you're lowering your numbers drastically and you're probably discouraging a lot of developers from even using the density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'However, the the housing element law does require for low income housing only 30 units per acre. Well, the current quota for Alameda is 800 units. By simple math, that would take. Under 30 acres of land. If you if the strategy you use was not density bonus, but the strategy you used was contracting with nonprofit agencies to provide'",
        "'speaker_1': 'dedicated low income housing, then you only need 30 acres to do it, not 2306 possible units that you have in 16 parcels now that are zoned for multi-family overlay. It's overkill, but. Council. The old council made the decision that the way to meet the the housing element was to to use density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's see how well that's worked so far. There have been 700 in the pipeline now, not counting Clement, there are 761 housing units going to be built in Del Monte, Alameda Landing and boat works. 84 of these are low income.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's 11%. If you add on to that, the 200 excuse me, 128 units that we're going to be getting from from the site that gets you up 120 or more. I guess you have the 13.5% at 11%. Using this system, you're going to need 7000 units to reach 800 low income housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just do the math. At 13 and a half percent. What you get when when you throw in the sun numbers, you're going to need 6000 units. That's where you're headed. We need low income housing. Are we willing to pay the price of seven, 6 to 7000 more units to get it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or should we concentrate on just getting low income housing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Somebodys iPad. Okay. It was both.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I got my e-mail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Greetings all around. Laura Thomas Renewed Hope Housing Advocates The Density Bonus. There seems to be a lot of fear engendered by it. What is it done? What's it going to do in the future? The staff report notes that in the last 20 years and Andrew was talking about that the cities only built 1800 or so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'units and only 59 in the last four years. And in that same 20 years, the population of Alameda has decreased. In the last 15 years, the city has only built, according to my count, 351 units of affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': '15 years. And that includes 147 units that are part of the Alameda Point Collaborative. So really, we've only built 200 affordable units in 15 years, so it's really not that much. I know, Andrew, use the term stable for growth in Alameda, but actually it's Measure A and various anti-growth policies that have kept it stable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now in the same 20 years, hundreds of Alameda residents, maybe even thousands, have been driven out. And you could go back to the destruction of wartime housing in the 1960s and the fact that the people that were forced out of those units could not mostly could not find housing in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They left Alameda. We also have the rent hikes of the Bridgeport Apartments in the 1980s. That prompted Clayton Guyton and Modesto Henderson to challenge Missouri because those people, hundreds of them, because it was a 600 unit project, could no longer afford the rent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was no place in Alameda because the Missouri. So then we have the 1999 dotcom boom that pretty much flushed out the west end of people who could no longer afford rent. And then we have the 2004 eviction of many hundreds of people at Harbor Island apartments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And now, again, we have the ongoing degradation and salt of Alameda citizens that are renters that we just can't seem to stop. So. There is a lot of housing that needs to be provided to stop this sort of thing from happening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not only is density bonus part A state law, it is part of our housing element and it's an essential part of city policy that encourages affordable housing and it overcomes the discriminatory, discriminatory effects of Missouri, which blocked multifamily housing and kept housing out of the reach of all the people that I just mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's unfortunate that we don't have statistics about all the people that have that have left. They've sort of fallen conveniently out of our sight as we focus on traffic and parking. Now, as the new locus of fear and lows, loathing and a new reason to block housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So putting a moratorium on the density bonus just. Shows that, you know, Alameda can find clever ways of stopping people from finding housing. And I think we need we have many current day comedians that are hanging on for dear life and could certainly use some compassion from the rest of us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we need housing. So enough said. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speakers, Angela Hook about the Lynnette Lee and then Bill Smith. Good evening, Mayor. Good evening, City Council. I'm here today on behalf of the Alameda Renters Coalition, and we're here to support city staff's report on the density bonus and hoping that a moratorium will not come to pass because more housing is desperately needed'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We know of families who can't afford to buy houses, who are still renters now, who cannot buy a house because there's not enough inventory. These people are putting more pressure on already a very tenuous rental market. And there are many families who can't yet afford to buy a house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the only other place they have is rental units or like myself, living with your mother in law. So as I'm saying, we need more housing. We need it as soon as possible. These attempts to try to block it from happening, even at the most dense levels, it's desperately needed, not just for the next five years'",
        "'speaker_0': ', ten years. We're talking 40 years. I brought my kids here tonight because they are fourth generation Alameda INS and their parents can't afford to buy a house here. And there are many families here moving here to have children.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Many of them also former Alameda INS who came back to have their families. And I'm worried that if we don't build densely, that my grandchildren and great grandchildren, all those children who are growing up here in Alameda now, will also be suffering the same consequences that we're suffering now, trying to find housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a long problem. This has been going on for a long time. And we need to start changing the way we think about housing because the population's only going to grow. And if we tried to take a more proactive approach to ensuring that those people can live here safely, cleanly and able to move around freely, I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'think the better off this whole city will be. So I really appreciate your time and I appreciate city staff for producing such a comprehensive report. It was very enlightening. Thank you very much. You're. The evening mayor and city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm Lynette, a member of Renewed Hope and the Buena Vista United Methodist Church. I think this staff has presented very well how a moratorium and density bonus is not needed and indeed would be very hard to implement given state legislation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In regards to some speaker's concerns about the density of new projects, we members of renewed hope are actually disappointed that so many of the multi-family overlay zones have proposed far less housing than would have been allowed as as Andrew pointed out earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as Angela and Laura have spoken, our church has sponsored numerous meetings together with renewed hope and the Alameda Renters Coalition, to allow space for renters to meet and express their concerns about being the high rent increases and whether how long can they stay in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, I echo housing is very much needed and affordable housing is needed. But the Georgia speaker previously said, well, why not just have affordable housing? Who's going to pay for it? Affordable housing does need subsidy. And what Alameda and other cities in California are doing is requiring for profit developers to help provide some of the subsidy'",
        "'speaker_0': 'needed to make the affordable housing happen. I, I do want to point out in regards to traffic, I think Andrew brought up a very good point earlier, which is why put all the burden of affordable of transportation mitigations on the 6% coming in on the new 6% of Alamitos.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why not spread that requirement evenly among Alameda residents and have everybody really take part in making those solutions happen, including financially? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Bill Smith, also a member of Renewed Hope. And I live in the city of Alameda. And I'd like to, first of all, just fill a little with a color the details about what could happen if the city tried to put a moratorium on the density bonus ordinance, how it might work procedurally.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And second, they get back to the more important thing about why it's in the interest for the city and economic development to go ahead and and build more housing and then illustrate that with some of the personal experience, including one I had today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So first, the city attorney and Andrew Thomas mentioned in 2012 there was a letter sent to the city pointing out that they were actually demanding it's called a demand letter, demanding the city become a compliant with state law that was sent by renewed hope by our organization, the lawyers that we work with and renewed hope are the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ones who sued the city of Pleasanton on that. So they've got good experience in this. And they actually worked with Governor Brown on their team when he was attorney general. They teamed with him for the state. Really goes after this seriously.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Alameda now is the poster child for what a city can be reformed. And I don't think as many of us in the affordable housing community would like to see Alameda backflow. So just so that's kind of what goes me for a while.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The lawyer and Pleasanton is in charge of issuing even all the building permits in town. They had to run through him and that was no fun for anybody, including including the lawyer. So it's it's a it's a mess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It comes down to that. But now to the to the more important thing why we should want to do that. And there's no point even considering that that's that is I was a I'm recruiting I work at one summer national lab we had a little over a year ago, maybe almost two years now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Berkeley looking at Alameda for expanding a campus. I was trying to recruit a summer student in there, come to work out of Livermore. And one of the first questions he asked as well. I don't have any money left after I pay for my housing here and in Livermore I came out because he's coming out from from Colorado'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and another one from Gainesville, too. I thought, well, I'm not I'm not sure about that, whether you have that or not. And so I told him, you may be lucky and you'll get somebody who's opening up their house and we'll give you a room or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's a problem. And I've also tried to work and recruit other graduate students and permanent employees, too. That's a big a big problem. We've heard from the Chamber of Commerce and from the realtors, too, that the doors one of the things they find about moving in Alameda is their younger employees don't have the money built up'",
        "'speaker_1': 'yet to buy a house and they need good rental housing where they define find modern rental housing. And so that's what we need to really make a go on in transportation. I'll come back if it doesn't go too late.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a comment on that. I do share a lot of the concerns on transportation and I really think we need to take a new approach to that. But this goes not from Hope's viewpoint necessarily, but from a from a different viewpoint.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'll I'll address that later. But please do consider very carefully the idea about and just clarify the ordinance, but not dismiss the idea of moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker, Diane Lichtenstein, then Doug Duncan and then John Suitor. Good evening. I'm Diane Lichtenstein with the Alameda Home Team and Helen Source is sorry she unavoidably couldn't come and has asked me to give you all this letter with her her viewpoint.'",
        "'speaker_0': '22 years ago, the Bragg Base Reuse Advisory Group was established, and we scoffed at I don't remember the name, but it was an airfield in Sacramento that it had been 20 years, that it had been close to a military base.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we said, oh, ho, ho, ho, that's this terrible. And we thought that a five year lease would would really be the maximum that we would want to give it Alameda point so that or at the base so so that we could go ahead and build.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was 22 years ago. And here we are. And I think that others might be scoffing at us. We have developers here who are not only willing, but anxious to develop not only unlimited point, but the other in other areas as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that we should all be embarrassed at the derelict and the blight that has gone on there. And to even think about delaying and not encouraging any kind of development to bring this up is an embarrassment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think all of us should cringe at the fact that here we are trying to stop something that is should be such an amazing asset to this city. Why would we even consider delaying anything that might turn off a developer?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, the just alone, the the obstacles there, let alone the infrastructure, you know, is huge. But there are those who who are interested in would develop. And now they hear, well, we want to we want to stop it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to take a look. It is unreasonable to me that anyone would even think about that, let alone the illegality. The it's equally important we're talking a lot and I feel very strongly that we need as much affordable housing as we possibly can get, but we also need market rate housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the density bonus allows for both because without market rate, as Lynette said, who's going to support the other in market rate is very important to me. I think we should have more Gold Coast housing that is an asset to the city as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Affordable housing to us. Is any house, any living that anybody can afford, not just low income. So we should encourage developers to come here and maybe grow up a little bit and make our city one that people will want to come and developers would want to come instead of putting obstacles in their way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please consider this and let's move ahead. Thank you. You.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Doug Duhon, ex vice mayor of alameda. I'm here and I heard what we talked about with the break in 22 years. And it's a deplorable situation at alameda point. But I want to correct a few things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, we the council that was here prior to this and the councils prior to that tried to do quite a few things. When we say 1% of Alameda was only affected by changing a multiple family overlay and negating major a one third of our island.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I made a point will be not under measure rates. All right that say well there will be a the other aspect and I heard that indeed we do not have an impact from the outside coming to Alameda. If you have gone down to do little when the freeway is impacted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People are coming into Alameda Town Doolittle and and penetrate through Alameda. Likewise, when we talk about the ferry system that has increased by 35%, the vast majority of that is coming from off island. The other thing that you need to recognize that the impacts around us that are occurring.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Brooklyn Basin. Ninth Street, Oak Street. 3500 homes are going to impact our access and moving out of alameda. The other portion was that in Alameda, when we settled a lawsuit with Chinatown, this council wanted the council back at that period of time, mandated that all redevelopment areas had certain 25% affordable housing mandated, and likewise any infill projects'",
        "'speaker_1': 'would be 15% at some point in time at 25% disappeared, and now it's to 15%. So what I guess I'm saying is the council took the direction to make sure we had affordable housing. Now we have a density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now let's carry it a little bit further. If you want density bonus, I want you to do the 25% plus. I want you to do the density bonus on top of that. I do not know if you are in jeopardy of the the Chinatown lawsuit.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other impacting factor, that's a major impact factor. The vast majority of your build out is at the West, and we know that as a fact. When you look at the constraint is the two. The tube is not been fully retrofitted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll say that again, it has not been fully retrofitted. We we went forward and Caltrans dismantled the tube, took four sections of park, realized they could not come out with a common fix for the remaining sections, and they patched the patient back together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that thing is not up to complete standards. Well, if you're talking about an impacting factor as one of your major impacting factors. So we know the bridges are going are retrofitted. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'John.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that one. There we go. Okay. I noticed here because I've got some census data here that where we get Alameda population and we're comparing 1990 to 210 and I happen to have the U.S. Census estimates for 2011, 2000, 12,013 and the one for 2014 is going to come out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, you know, I guess the world is divided into three sections of people. You know, those who understand math and those who don't. But down here, it gives you the impression that that that alamy the population is actually going down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When indeed. According to the U.S. government, lo and behold, estimated in July of 19, 2013, the population is more or less wooden, more or less. B 76,419. So it isn't really gone down at all. And I would say we're going to get another one of these out in about six months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would bet you. You know, one of those old 1935 cars that are all coming from going down from Puerto Vista into the tube, that we're actually going to be over 77,000 folks. Okay. So, again, I don't you know, I'm just I'm just I'm just showing the projections here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll be happy to provide them all to you people in the in the city council and the mayor of just what I'm talking about. But using the 2010 figures when we're in 2015 and waiting for the 2022 actually census to come out, that the way we, you know, we should be planning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think so. That was my only concern. I just happen to have those figures here. But I mean, once we all look at it, we're going to know that by now we're over 77. They come in cars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speakers will be Rob Reiner, Karen Bay, and then John Spangler.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Smile. Thank you. Jeez, you look so serious. All right, Rob, writer, executive director, Park Street Business Association. And believe it or not, I wasn't going to speak this evening, but two things during the presentation kind of sparked me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It sparked me to get up here. One is I'm going to urge this council the same thing. I urged the last council when they passed the housing element. I know some of you, if not all of you, have issues with our dense density bonus ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you do, then go ahead and push it right to the edge of the envelope. But the thing you do not want to do. You do not want to let the state of California or the courts get involved with running Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is not good for alameda. You all know I've been up here doing this for 16 years and every time the state gets involved and every time the courts get involved in issues in this town, it is not good for alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys got elected. We have a wonderful staff. Figure it out. I don't have any knowledge about all these percentages and what have you, but I do know you don't want to get the state and the courts involved in running this town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys run this town? Let the staff run the town. Okay. You have an excellent city attorney, in my humble opinion. And Frank, you know, I've never had a humble opinion in my entire life. Thank you. Listen to her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She is your legal counsel, and that's all I'm going to say about density bonus. And hopefully I will never say anything else on density bonus. The other thing that I wanted to drop tonight is the transportation planning for the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My board of directors and a couple of our committees have been yakking for a couple of months now on coming and asking the city to put together the business associations. All four of them. Are private industry hotels and try to come up with a plan that in God only knows how long we could actually have a unified'",
        "'speaker_1': 'city of alameda shuttle system similar to what they've got in Emeryville. I it's I can't think of what it's called.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go go.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Around. Thank you. But my organization is convinced that this town needs something like that. How's it going to get together? How is it going to be funded? I have no idea. But that's the point. Let's start getting together and figure out how we can do something like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because gang it if Emeryville. If Emeryville can do it, Alameda can do it, too. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Any smile now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Aaron? Their business district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Association pays for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the next budget. And. Leaving Madumere. Members of the City Council staff. My name is Karen Bay and long term resident of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thomas, for that wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Presentation. I learned a lot tonight that I didn't know then that one. One thing that we've been dealing with transportation issues for a long time and we've been talking about it for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The other thing that I learned tonight was that focusing solely on the problem will give us more of the same. Just the problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Shifting from focusing on the problem to focusing on solutions will give us solutions. And what I'm hearing tonight is that the future looks bright, that there are lots of solutions out there. It's really exciting to hear people talking about solutions like the free shuttle, possibly a boat station, water taxis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I've heard people talking about in fact, I think we're going to hear a little bit of that in the presentation. I've been watching Oakland and they've been talking about streetcars. I've heard some people even mentioned possibly a local transportation tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then I've also watched Oakland and they've hired a full time dedicated transportation director. I think our staff is doing a great job. But what's going to happen when all these teams come online? I think we really need a full time person dedicated to managing those two teams, and I think we could use a traffic transportation policy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'director or whatever we choose to call them. And then I wanted to end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By talking about the ferry. I have been riding the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ferry for 15 years, and I tell the story about it. You know, it used to be by 810, I could arrive at the ferry and I would get a wonderful parking space. And, you know, I get to, you know, within moments I'm on the I'm on the boat.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now I have to get there by eight and I'm parking on a dirt parking lot. And I have to walk quite a ways. And I'm not complaining because I love taking the ferry. I wouldn't give it up for the world.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But so many people have discovered the ferry. It's wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are at full capacity and that's before the 6% gets here. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have got.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To focus on solutions. And a new ferry terminal would be awesome. And I'd like to see an end. And Closing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Development helps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fund our traffic or transportation infrastructure improvements so we can complain about development. But with all of the impact fees and all of the charges that we levy on developers, they actually can help us solve some of our problems.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Spangler and then Linda Weinstock. And those are the last slips. If you want to speak on this item, please turn on your.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, mayor spencer. Members of the council and staff. I'm John Spangler. I've been here since 1997 and I couldn't make it here earlier tonight because I was running our shuttle to pick Linda up from the Jack London Square Amtrak station where she gets off the Capitol corridor at 5 minutes of seven.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's a long way to Santa Clara and back. We have affordable housing here. We had to start renting five years ago. We just got a notice for 15% rent increase as of May 1st. There is no place for us to go if the rent goes up like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It used to be in Redwood City, where I grew up. I could get much less expensive rents. But Google and other big companies just finished leasing the entire capacity of buildings that haven't even been finished yet so they can sublease to their employees.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And those rents are going to be 2400 to $3000 a month and up for studios now. The reason only two partners wanted to have rental units at only two point was for the workforce housing that they that they had already seen going in at bay farm and other places here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Linda and I are part of that workforce still. And anybody who wants to cut the number of rental housing units allow me to point or anywhere else is helping me to leave town. I don't like that very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now. I want to refer back to this, the figures you see here and the talk about traffic congestion. First of all, Almeida does not have traffic congestion compared to downtown San Francisco or downtown San Jose or Los Angeles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anybody who calls it congestion is nuts by comparison. Period. End of discussion. Second, if you want to talk about to capacity. If you put AC transit busses running through the tube the way you've got single occupancy cars, we could quadruple quintuple or more the capacity of the tubes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not the number of people that's the limit. It's the number of single occupancy cars. It clogs it up for 5 to 10 minutes extra, only at the rush hours. Same reason you get the same problem with people driving their kids.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Bay Farm Island schools are coming over to Edison from Bay Farm in their cars when their kids could ride their bikes or walk. It's very simple. Cars are the problem. Single occupancy driver cars in particular. We need to not have them a moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We need to build more high density housing as high density housing residents, the people who want to live without cars can build and live in those houses. Take the transit, take the load off that the congestion or ride their bikes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From Alameda Point at the new rental apartments out to Bay Farm Island. It's a nice flat ride. It's easy. I talked to people at Amtrak in Oakland. I'm almost done. He's me. They ride 15 to 20 miles each way every day, either down in the valley.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Once they get off the train. The capital, capital train that Linda takes or on their way in in the morning with their headlights. One of the guys who delivers the mail in Oakland for the US Postal Service gets up and gets on the train at four in the morning in Davis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To get to work deliver the mail in Oakland. And you write to spike in Oakland. There are simple solutions. They're not difficult. We don't need a moratorium. We just need to use our brains and use the options that exist now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Linda WINESTOCK. And then Tony Cutler. Hi, I'm Linda Weinstock, and I am on the board of Mastic Senior Center. And I have a concern because I'm seeing a lot of seniors being displaced. And I think I have a solution and I've brought it up to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Quite a few people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't have a transitional living community for people, for seniors that want to stay in Alameda and live in place, be around their families, see their grandchildren. What's happening to them is they can't afford to live in their big homes, so their families are taking them somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we had a little sun like community or a Del Webb community in Alameda where they use golf carts were bused in to the library Boston to mastic center use their bikes had save walking trails could use Alameda trails.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think this is something that would benefit our community and we would not be bringing more traffic we would they would be using what I'm using walking and and when it comes to the traffic coming through, I live at South Shore Beach and tennis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been there for seven years. The bike trail is the best thing that you have ever done for our community. We are not getting any of the traffic and the noise of the people going from the tube through a shoreline over to over to Bay Farm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're using Otis now. The traffic has slowed down to about 20 miles an hour. We do need a crosswalk at the blinking light or else somebody's going to get hit. So I'm just letting. I've been taking photographs. That's the only thing wrong is we just need a cross the crosswalk there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's amazing the respect that people have for each other now. The families that are out, the multi generation, I mean I'm seeing grandparents with kids and we're using it and we have more residents from Alameda that are using it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not just people from Oakland. So I'm really happy with what you've done there. We just need to connect it around the island with maps saying this is the safe zone you can get around if you're connected and we need to connect the successful things that we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all. Thank you. Thank you. Tony Cutler.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. My kid said, I'm really dense. Where do I play for the bonus? Tony Kushner I'm the president of the Greater Armenia Business Association. I wanted to speak not so much about the housing density issue directly, but about transportation specifically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gabba believes that the solution lies in a Freedom Riders comprehensive shuttle service that serves the entire island. You want the focus of any transportation plan in the city to primarily be on transportation within the city and helping the residents of the city, helping the business of the city just as much as it's focused on getting people out'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of the city to their jobs in San Francisco or San Jose or Silicon Valley, wherever. We are really committed to working with. Park Street West. Alameda Chamber of Commerce City Council. With all new development, all of this to make sure that we believe that we can establish a viable free shuttle service that is available to residents, that's'",
        "'speaker_1': 'available to businesses, that's available to students, and addresses the issues of slow traffic, of single occupancy vehicle traffic. And it has to be much more than expanding existing transportation solutions that we have with erratic schedules, with service controlled outside of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we believe that by having multiple funding sources involved in this, multiple stakeholders be involved in this, that it will serve the broadest possible base and that will have the broadest possible support. So in any transportation plan that you guys are considering moving forward, please make sure that that is a priority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It is my understanding, Vice Mayor, that this was your item. This is. Did you bring this item?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I think we voted on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So did you want to speak first, though, in regards to comments at this point? And did we want to have comments now before we go to the next item? Yes. All right, Vice Mayor, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate it. I think one of the things that I've heard loud and clear and I think from the city attorney's concise explanation of it, is a moratorium in the legal sense of the word is not a viable option.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The risks, I think, outweigh any benefits that we might get from that. But that question had to be asked. The second is, I'm I don't have a problem with our density bonus ordinance in that I was here in 2009.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I voted for it. I voted for purposefully because it had some provisions that I believe protect the city. And the issue that I have is that we have not been following it. In the sense that complete applications weren't submitted prior to granting the density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I, I think there are a couple of points that I hope that when we do a revision, I'd like to direct staff to do a revision so that we can capture those and have check points for the risks that's present.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm looking at the application Section 3017, the applicant shall submit an affordable housing plan and I understand the issue of floor plans, etc., but the issue of a financial report or a proforma to evaluate whether the density bonus is needed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To provide the affordable units. And to me, it's a scale of how much. And I'm looking at comparing, for example, a density bonus approved project in Alameda versus one right across 294, six or one in Oakland, where the values are different and the risk to the developer is certainly different.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because in Alameda, your return is because of the prices of the market rate. Your return is much higher than it would be in, say, the ninth or 501 on the other side of the Fruitvale Bridge, 94601 on the other side of the Fruitvale Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. I do think it's necessary, for example, in the application that there is evidence to justify why it's necessary to provide for affordable housing costs, why the concessions are. And I think that should be everything that's in our required application should be there prior to granting the bonus and that it's not there because I've asked for it'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And in looking at it and I think it was answered in those things well. Will be necessary prior to granting the permit. But by that time we've entitled the developer to certain rights and they don't have those rights when they're submitting the application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that's why it's important to protect the city. So. I'd like us to give direction to the planning staff to reconcile. They face options with some protections that address these points. And. Secondly, I think I heard two other things that I'd like us to challenge as a council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One is, I thought I heard that we can't put limits on housing. And. I think we can put limits as long as they're within the envelope of what we put in our our dent, our housing element, because we have only 245.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's a number that's based on the realistic capacity, which is far lower than if you took the zone in and multiplied it out by the number of acres. And if you look at what happened with Del Monte, where the realistic capacity is 200, we have 380 there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that 200 was part of the the site designation that led us to 220, 245, which is well above our regional housing needs assessment. And I'd like us to look at taking another look because we're a few years down the road at the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And looking at changing the zoning to lower. The potential over and above what's listed in our realistic capacity, which is, by the way, is designed, quite designed and explained in the housing element right before this table 2021 is to take a look at that or the coast of the old north housing because north housing, there are 282'",
        "'speaker_6': 'empty units there right now. We have a agreement with the Navy from 2009. It says we can take 435 units there. With 90 of those units being for very low the homeless to address the homeless requirements when transferring vacant land from the government and 30 units of a very low income potentially affordable ownership housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's 120 units. That's 28% of that project. And I think that contributes, again, 120 units of affordable housing in one fell swoop without taking a density bonus approach where. We're just by multiplying out the zoning. We have 121 units at that site and with a 10% density bonus, we have 1233, which is almost all of our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'arena in in one location. So I think that type of analysis, I think, will help us. Respect the constraints that we have as an island. And I was looking at the number of 50, 196 cars in the tube versus the number of 5169.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I. There we go. Yes. Versus the if I'm reading this graph correctly, it says there are 2500 northbound in the AM commute which. I think we need to reconcile some data here, but I think that is an indication that we have a constraint.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as long as we're working within the envelope of what we promised and the state certified, I think we do have some latitude to put some reasonable limits on the growth so that we can respect the the constraints that we're under as an island.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also would like us because we have just by desirability a very high priced housing here in MM. To put an emphasis and one speaker talked about going back to the 25% for affordable housing as long as it meets that requirement of being integrated into the into the development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's indistinguishable from the market rate housing. I think that's our direction that I'd like to see so that we can work the balance, so that we can have some affordability here in the city. So those are my comments and I think it was very comprehensive presentation and this is just the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think you met Mayor. Actually I think staff for that that thorough presentation I think it's has a new council member. It was very useful information. And I think, you know, the public needs to hear this information more frequently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I disagree with one of the commenters. I do think, Mr. Vice Mayor, that this was a good idea to take a look at. I think this was a good idea for us to to have a workshop on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And same to Councilmember Day. So we haven't heard the transportation portion of this, but I think it's also a good idea for us to hear hear that presentation as well. These are two critical issues and there's a lot of misinformation going around in the city, and I'm glad that we're able to clear some of that up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I do want to address a couple comments that that I heard, you know, from the public. You know, once kind of a general, you know, our concern or at least my concern is the northern waterfront is the development on the northern waterfront is the traffic generator from the northern waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't want to speak for the vice mayor, but I believe that was, you know, one of his concerns when when he first raised this issue. So I think to the extent that we can we can take a look at this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, that's where a lot of my concern is coming from. I think the history of Alameda Point, there's there's two former council members up here. There are a lot of stops and starts. There's a lot of issues with the economy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think we can cast a lot of blame on our predecessors for the long time that it's taken to get us where we are. And I think looking at what we have in front of us now, I think we have a lot better options.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we have, I think, a lot better plans than we would have had if we would have done this back in 1997 and 1999 and 2000. So, Linda, are you still here? This is kind of as I appreciate your Facebook photos of all the beautiful spots in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just you know, I do read those. I do see those. And I really appreciate those. It also takes you to the kind of the race to the bottom comments that were made that we should be grateful. And if we really want to, you know, see traffic, we should go to San Francisco or San Jose or Los Angeles'",
        "'speaker_5': '. This is Alameda. We're not going to be San Francisco. Our goal should not be to be San Jose. Our goal should not be to be Los Angeles. I mean, we want to preserve what we have in Alameda. And I think we should be grateful that we don't have the problems.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I don't think we should have a race to the bottom and say, well, because those places have worse traffic than, you know, we should consider ourselves lucky and not not think about that. And, you know, I was one of those people that drove my kids to school.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They were they were girls. I frankly, I did not want them walking. And I wouldn't make that decision again today if I had to make it. So, you know, not everyone can and not everyone wants to bicycle. So it just had a little bit of concern about those comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think one thing that that the the city planner raised in his discussion about, you know, we're really a feeder to AT&T. There was article in the Chronicle, I think it was February, sometime back in February the 15th, one of the second most riskiest onramp in the Bay Area is the ramp from 29th Avenue to southbound 80'",
        "'speaker_5': 'because folks from Alameda going over the Park Street Bridge and trying to get onto 880. So I think that kind of reinforces that this is kind of a regional issue and it's not something that, you know, we can address in a vacuum.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Another thing that didn't come up but I've heard this in the from AC Transit is here you. No the last oecs leaves Bay Farm at 8:00. And I've heard from people that if there was another oecs, it would alleviate some of the pressure on parking at at on bay from island for the ferry station.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's probably an issue for another day. But I think that is something that we might want to look at is, you know, running another Oecs bus, you know, it's the oecs is the. Sorry, sorry to be Bay Farm speak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the bus that takes you directly from bay, from across the bridge and to downtown San Francisco, the express bus. And then there was a comment that, you know, we have a welcome environment for development. I think, you know, quite the opposite is true.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we have an unwelcome environment for development or at least a skeptical environment for development. I think that's a good thing. You know, I don't think we should be putting up projects just for the sake of building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We as a city are skeptical and we take a careful look at these projects, and I think we're going to continue to do that. So I think it's a little bit unfair to tell this council because I can think of at least two or three other people that don't think that they are friendly to development or don't'",
        "'speaker_5': 'think that they are welcoming development and rubberstamp every single project. So I think that's a little unfair and I think give this council a chance to put our stamp on these projects. And I think you'll see that we do have the best interests of our city at heart.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So just to kind of comment finally on. The meat of the presentation. You know, I think what my two takeaways were, you know, housing is a statewide concern. You know, an Alameda cannot legally say no to housing below our our require our state requirement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I agree with the vice mayor. You know, that should be considered our cap knowing that we have future obligations we're going to have to do knowing that we have Alameda point. You know, I don't think we need to be going over that camp.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And ideally, we go under it so we could use some of that space in ten years because the council that's here in ten years is going to have or eight years is going to have the same issues and they're going to have the same debates.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, let's see if we can make sure that, you know, we're not building everything so fast, so quickly that, you know, we run out of space and I don't want to see that happen. So and I think the other main point that came out here was Alameda can't use traffic as a reason to stop housing'",
        "'speaker_5': '. I mean, the state says that's not a legitimate reason. So we kind of have two choices in my mind. We can either mitigate or litigate. So I think we're going to hear from staff on a proposal, an idea to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that's what we have to do. Litigate, to me, has in a way too many risks. We can lose funding for projects that are important to us transportation parks. We will lose control over, you know, where housing gets to build, where it gets to be built.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We basically, as one of the public commenters said, will cede control over the destiny of our island to the state. And I don't want to have that happen on my watch while I'm sitting in this chair. The financial the staff talked about the financial hit that Pleasanton took.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We could do that. We could bet the farm, you know, we could bet our city budget on litigating this. But then we don't have any money to take care of other things like OPEB and all the other issues that we're going to be talking about in the next few months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And someone's got to pay for that and. I want to hear from you. If you if you willing to litigate that and you're willing to raise your taxes to litigate that, then tell me this and I can make that decision.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But at this point, I'm not ready to take that risk. And I think most important to those of us who love the character of our city. The city attorney explained it. If we litigate this, we lose Missouri. And that's not something I want to see happen on my watch either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mary Spencer. So thank you to everyone who came out and spoke. I think it is clear from both the staff report, the presentation, thank you to the city attorney for amplifying some of the points made that we have to apply with applicable law, abide by applicable law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's been clearly laid out in the state, in the staff report and all that is before us this evening, as I understand it. And this item three is to prepare to provide direction to city staff as to whether we want to prepare want staff to prepare amendments to the city's density bonus ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate the input that we got from our vice mayor, vice mayor, Motor City. I think that some very interesting information on the housing element. Unfortunately, we didn't all have the documentation before us and I have a hard time and I'm sure the public does in following something, especially that detailed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So maybe when this if and when this comes back again, we could all get copies of whatever is discussed as far as documentation, but I don't think quite those suggestions are are before us tonight. And just a word on evidence or material that is presented to the council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do appreciate members of the public coming and providing photographs and whatnot. It's not the same as a piece of evidence provided in court. We don't know how it was collected over what time span. I appreciate it. But for us, for me anyway, it's a matter of how much weight to give it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just was I was puzzled a little by some information about census data and a slide that we were looking at and the implication that Mr. Thomas had understated the population. But actually, on page eight of the staff report, Mr. Thomas does indicate that our current population is approximately 75,988 residents, and that's actually slightly below the'",
        "'speaker_2': '1990 population showed on shown on the table. That was about 76,000. So it's you know, we we as a council have the the mandate to read through all this material. I know it's a lot for others to go through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But anyway, thank you to staff for putting this very lengthy report together. And then I I'm intrigued by Mr. Shatner's suggestions about free shuttles. I sat in the audience and listened in on the Joint Transportation Commission Planning Commission meeting a week ago maybe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Laurie Zupan, one of the planning board members, also, you know, was touting that we should have a free shuttle on the east end of town because we noticed that there's this concentration of shuttles on the West End.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm all for it. Anything that gets people out of their cars and on to shuttles, it would it would help the senior population, I'm sure. Just remember that nothing is free. So I'm I'm not saying it's not a good thing to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it is. And I just told our newly named interim city manager, okay, put that on your list. But we do need to look at some funding sources. So business associations in the audience and we're looking at you too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the same applies to the suggestion that we work only the city work only with nonprofit developers to put together affordable housing. Anybody who's put together affordable housing and I'm by no means an authority, but people in this room certainly are knows it's a tricky proposition to cobble together all the different sources so it you know it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'sounds good on on its face but I'm just here to tell you that it's every every project we put together is such a victory because it means we jump through all these hoops. And I do want to see us do more of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it's not a a simple answer. So thank you all. And I look forward to moving forward on these suggestions. And I'll just throw out that I know I should stop talking because if we go past 11 tonight, city council colleagues, we will be adding additional meetings for the rest of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyday soccer. Great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you very much to the members of the public who came out to this special workshop on two subject matters of the density bonus, as well as the citywide comprehensive transportation strategy that we're contemplating on the matter of the density bonus idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My feeling is that we ought not to implement a moratorium on the density bonus. The way that it is is that our city staff it really walking a fine line when it comes to a variety of matters. The fine line they're caught between is, on the one hand, Sacramento and persons there, you know, really bearing down on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'cities like Alameda and quality cities like Pleasanton. On the other hand, the staff recognizes that, you know, we're an island, something that the state doesn't recognize. The state sees 400 plus cities. But to them, you know, everything is they don't there's only a few island cities in all of California.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think staff recognizes that we're an island and that as we move forward, we have to be nimble in terms of our limited capacity. So that's why, for example, you heard tonight that even though we could build more from the vantage point of some when it comes to the density bonus or even the housing overlay, what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'projects have come forward now have not actually reached the potential. So it's a fine line that staff is working. You know, they're being pushed on the one hand by by Sacramento and their various laws. But on the other hand, they're sensitive to, you know, the constraints that we as a city face.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yet if we had a third hand, on the other hand, they're also they also recognize that, you know, we've got matters like the need for more rental housing in Alameda and the need for more mix of rental housing, market rate housing, new new market rate housing, as well as affordable housing and affordable not just for, you'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know, how Sacramento defines low income and very low income, but before affordable for all. So so I think in order to keep moving forward, to keep having our city staff work that nimble walk, that nimble fine line that they've been walking on behalf of of the residents, we ought not to implement a moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We ought to look at what's happening at, for example, parcel A as an opportunity parcel at Alameda Point. You know, things won't happen for three or four years. But, you know, I think I think a lot of renters right now are just looking for a signal that we care about, you know, the situation that we're in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know for sure, I mean, for me to be talking about more rental housing, you know, when, hey, part of my baby, you know, I get it. So so tonight I think we ought not to be talking about a moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I'm most excited about will be the subject of the next matter is, you know, talking about solutions around which we can bring a lot of people together, people who are concerned about too much housing, people who want, you know, more options when it comes to not just getting off the island, but also internal linkages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think, uh, I think one of the members, Linda Weinstock, said it best that what we ought to be doing is connecting the successful things that we are doing. I wrote that down, and I think with the very next subject matter, we're going to start talking about how we can begin to implement it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is the exciting stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I, too, want to thank all the speakers that came out tonight. We had a lot of, I think, really good suggestions and good comments. I, too, am concerned about the safety of our community, and I think that there's an appropriate time for us to look at those issues separate from this housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have been speaking, for instance, with East Bay mud. So we do have to look at our water supply in the event of a natural disaster. We have to look at, for instance, what would happen to the tube.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those are issues we need to address transportation after a disaster. And I think as a council we will. And, you know, and I think staff is working on these issues, too, in regards to a moratorium. I agree with other council members here that it's not the appropriate solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, I also agree with comments from Vice Mayor in regards to looking at not overbuilding and holding to these numbers from the overlay. If I'm saying that correctly, I would like us to look at that. We had a speaker that spoke to reducing the number of units per acre from 2030 to 21.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like us to look at that until we address these safety issues, whether or not it rises to what the state would think is reasonable for moratorium. To me, I think those issues need to be addressed. And until we do address, I think better the transportation issues as well as water issues, the two things like that'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I don't think it's appropriate for us to. I think it is appropriate for us to try to at least put reasonable limits on housing. I would like to try to increase the percentage of below market rate. The numbers, some of the numbers we saw the totals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it was like 800 units of above market rate and a 100 below market rate over the past five years or something, whatever those numbers were. I think we have to do better than that. I would like to see much closer to 5050 and I and and I would like to figure out how we can if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we need to look at zoning or how we really end up with senior housing. Is that a zoning issue? How do we address that? I don't really want to leave it up to the developers to tell bring at some point that type of housing, because I think it is a serious need in our community and I don't'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know if it is a zoning issue or how we or how we really encourage that to make to have it happen. So I'd like to see that. Can. And of course I agree with the member OTI in regards to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not want to have the traffic congestion of other large cities. We are an island. And and then in regards to Mr. Cutler's point of working on this variant, Mr. Rato, that is something that I am also speaking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I've also had the opportunity to speak with someone from Oakland on that they too are concerned about traffic from Alameda to catch BART there. So how how do we solve that or, you know, a better way to address that issue?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I think it would be appropriate to have a way to do some sort of survey of who the riders are at both Bay Farm and the main island. Because if they are coming from off island or depending upon how far away, how do we accommodate the parking?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because, yes, we want to increase membership ridership on the ferries. But then what do we do with the automobiles if they're driving in? And that's an issue both places we know that and it is impacting Alameda and so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to see what we could do to encourage that type of information to be shared with us so that we can encourage sufficient parking or, you know, at least raise the issue and discuss it as a council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then we have no do we have we need a moat. Are we going to have a motion on this item or. Madam Mayor, if I'm. Yes, may help if I've sort of heard what council was saying.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, I think staff and please jump in here might be we heard you we took notes, copious notes, if we could maybe get a motion to go ahead and go forward with the process to make the amendments to the density bonus ordinance as directed here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also we can come back in with some kind of a procedure timeline. I'm looking at that sort of rebalancing of housing units and be able to bring that back. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to clarify, I think exactly and I would like to if I could get a motion on both of those and I see it as two simultaneous efforts. So the direction on the density bonus like get that ordinance fixed with all those issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that means the my next step would be to develop the amendments, take them to public hearing with the planning board and then they would come back to you and that would you would be in a position to adopt those amendments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that would be the route for that. The second set of work, which we'll be doing simultaneously, would be developing this the reshuffling of the of the units, reducing the overall capacity base. Mayor's proposal. With all the amendments that each of you mentioned, I think, you know, the weed stuff and the ridership and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need some time to sort of put that all in writing, sort of a conceptual game plan. And what I'd like to do is bring that back directly to the council so that all of you can see, Oh, okay, we kind of see what this means and what you're thinking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'STAFF And then like we did with this tonight with Nancy Bowen, as you say, presumably you like it and you're like, okay, yes, we like that rebalancing. We've reduced some of that as we start that process. And what that process then is public hearings, because we're talking about zoning general plan amendments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll have to work with the state of California to make sure we're not going sideways with the housing element. And then ultimately, that would end back with you for final adoption of those amendments. So it would be sort of two processes going somewhere continuously, but not just one process happening at once, if that that makes sense.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like clarification. We've heard from a few speakers in regards to the apartments at the point and it's my understanding and then someone actually shared what they thought the rents could be as high as $3,000 plus for a studio, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's my understanding that rent control does not is not possible in California, in the state of California, on new apartments built after 1995.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, even even in cities with rent control, they don't apply to the new units being built. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that that's real important for me that I would like, you know, if we're going to have apartments, that it has to be a I would like a higher percentage that is going to be below market rate, that somehow we can protect that because I'm confident that market rate apartments will not serve the need of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'many people that in town for instance, we had speaker not this meeting but a prior one whose child whose daughter is a teacher and she would really appreciate housing for that teacher and is looking to that apartment housing as this solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I at some point I would like some clarification from staff so that to educate our community about what possible rent control could attach to and and not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely well we'll be back for future meetings in the very near future. Just on Alameda Point, I'll just mention for anybody who's interested, this council has already upped the ante for me to point. So citywide, the inclusionary affordable housing requirement on all projects is 15%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At Alameda Point, the council has already said now 25% of all units affordable. The current plan is that those be rentals. So but let's not get too much into the point tonight because I know you're running out of time and your big transport.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need a motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'An American. I move that we. Directs the city manager staff to. Proposed revisions to the density bonus ordinance. To address the issue of phasing, which is not. It connected at this moment with the protections to make sure that there is sufficient evidence to justify why it is necessary to provide the concessions to grant to to deliver the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'affordable housing and to make sure that the. If the application includes a financial report. That. Shows that the concessions sought will result in the affordable houses of affordable units proposed, and that these will protect provide the same protections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The revisions will provide the same protections that were intended with the original ordinance. And not be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Confused, Larry. A man asked the city clerk to. I hate to do this to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So we'll direction that staff through the city manager propose revisions to density bonus ordinance to address the issue of phasing with protection protections to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With the protections that were included in the original.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's what I missed. And the original ones that are specific, that are specific to grant the affordable housing, the application would include a financial report with the concern that the concessions sought will result in affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And provide the same protection. We have second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well. And here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, they saw my.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Interpretation of what Council Vice Mayor Matt, R-S.C., is saying. Art of interpretation is that there is an amount of reporting that is on the books that's that that should be done as part of the density bonus program. And that for whatever reason, some of that reporting had not been done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my interpretation of what of vice mayor proposal is that? We're requiring all reporting, as that's indicated, under the density bonus as a necessary part of the approval process, application and approval process, not something that can just be kind of done afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just asked clarifying question. It sounds like it's just another way of saying the three proposals. Although the three proposals in the Stafford part of the you didn't really mention waiver, but I think you did say, you know, provide evidence in the site plan in the drawing that's required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And no, I separated the drawings out because I think those are the issues that are most prominent in the phasing so that I'm looking for the protections, the evidence that the concessions are needed to provide. The developer with the funds to build the affordable housing and then the performer that goes with that prior to granting the density'",
        "'speaker_6': 'bonus.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If I may jump in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that that's number two then on the recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And not number one or number three. Okay. Correct. Can I ask the vice mayor if he's opposed to number one and number three or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just called out the ones that I think are most important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If someone want. Did you want to try to amend it? Is there a second for the stated motion? Or did someone want to?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, Madam Mayor, if I can ask a question of the city attorney's office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Have you had a chance to vet this? And does this put us at any legal. Possibly put us at any legal and then drum with the state if we. Because, again, my interpretation is these are on the books, the financial reporting and also the of the two of the three items, two and three that member Ody'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and Vice Mayor, Madam Essity mentioned. These are already on the books. But I think in some instances, perhaps in the Del Monte thing, it wasn't done immediately. So me, I think my again my interpretation of what council member matter is simply saying is it has to be part on the front end of any projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in making that official, does that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, if I may and I don't want to be misinterpreting what the council member is saying. So let me just put it out there. I was taking that to mean that you want staff to go forward, try to do the clarifying or to clarify the density bonus ordinance so everyone understands it more clearly and the way staff'",
        "'speaker_0': 'has been interpreting it. And I think we can look at what councilmember matter S.E. is suggesting in that process. Am I incorrect in that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is what's happening. All we're asking for is if you think we need to do some work on the density bonus ordinance. And what I'm hearing Councilmember Patterson saying, we want to have as much control as we can over the granting of these things within the confines of state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to and we want to clarify this phasing process. I'm going to write an analysis with with the city attorney's office for the planning board in the public's review at a future hearing at the planning board saying, all right, here's kind of the confines of state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here's where we can adjust. We can get more control over here on all these issues or less, if we want to give up control within this. But we're staying within the confines of state law will lay those out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The public will comment on them. The planning board might decide to go a little bit this way or a little bit that way, but then we'll be back to you. We will give you the exact same analysis, and you can ultimately decide how you want to adjust the ordinance when it comes back to you, because you're the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'final decider. And we'll make sure that whatever we recommend in our reports to planning board and then ultimately to you, you understand where the where the boundaries are without getting sideways with state law. So you can you can make as many adjustments as you want at that point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think you have to figure. My point is you're not telling us exactly what to amend right now. You're just telling us get the process going, go through the process so you can get back to us as soon as possible where you can make final decisions and actually adopt changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and council and Vice Mayor Emanuel say, I think we very clearly heard what your concerns are as your colleagues have. So those will be taken into consideration as comments from the rest of the council members from the diocese.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I'm okay with. I mean, I'd be willing to second that motion, but I think one in three should also be considered, if that's something you want to have considered. A separate question. Then I can second your motion and then we can discuss one and three separately.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know that we need to separate that out. I just want to make sure that in the. In the incorporation of the phasing aspect for a large project, we don't lose the upfront justifications that our current ordinance requires to grant the bonus because the bonus was basically granted when the development agreement was granted with Del Monte'",
        "'speaker_6': 'without a complete application. And those two pieces, I think, provide us with the biggest risk. Especially in a long term project of of it not we we've entitled the person and then we're waiting to enforce the the financial stability of it at the time of issuing the permits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's a bad way to do business.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Number data verify in question now that Vice Mayor Matarese raised the Del Monte in particular. So whatever research we do based on the information you collect on these three items. However, we shape the ultimate policy. I in my interpretation of things, the Del Monte project is already out of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. Councilmember de so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's for example, purposes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we're just hearing for an example and the reason it came up was because it's in staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not asking to resurface.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No staff continues to believe in. Let me be clear, the Del Monte project was appropriately approved. All we're trying to do is clarify in the ordinance. So there aren't the questions that council that Vice Mayor Maher SC has raised.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member Ashcraft So and I appreciate the discussion. I happen to think that all three of the proposed tax amendments have a place, and I, I agree with the Vice Mayor's observations, but I would like to see the amendments as they're stated on page six of the staff report with regard to phased projects is number one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number two is incentives or concessions, and number three is waivers. And I, I don't see the harm of including them all. I just think it gives us even more direction and clarity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I agree with that. I just want to make sure that in the phasing, we don't give up the controls that we have. On the front and on section two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you would add some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I was going to say, is there a motion that we could have that would can something can you have a motion that would include the three plus what your concerns are?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and I might even second if I could just find it. So are you saying vice mayor matter? See, you want to add a little language to phrase two of the phased. You like staff to incorporate the the concerns that you raised.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. To that phased project section, which is that something staff is able to do?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Right. So do we have a motion? You want to make a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motion as amended?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll make the motion. Amend the motion to say that we're going to incorporate or give direction based on the three points. Recognizing and asking staff to pay attention to make sure that we're. Focusing on at the front end of granting the density bonus the items listed in section two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will second any discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then go ahead and call the question. Although some favor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oppose. None. Abstentions. Motion passes unanimously. Thank you, Mayor. Can we get a motion on the other item about coming back with a timeline process for shuffling? Thank you, counsel. We have another motion, and we're Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, with a little sidebar consultation here, the next item three B is really another meaty item. And I think we'd like public participation. And I think the public and the council doesn't want to be out till one in the morning again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I believe that the proposal is to do what is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry to be shuffling. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to make a motion memory that we're asking for?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the the motion that you're looking for is that we ask staff to come back with a proposed timeline for looking within the confines of what we've gotten certified by the state and our housing element, adjusting the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Such that we can. Put some reasonable limits on the potential of housing. That list is listed when we look at the current zoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And does that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Clarification. So if I understand that correctly, that's not actually a motion, but that's a form of direction given through the city manager to the staff. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We all have to not our heads in council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But did that satisfy your requests? Yes. Of doing so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, so we did a motion to go with a member.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That would include the possible reshuffling. Yes. Maybe it should mention.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Readjusting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Adjusting life rhythm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Taking into consideration that we're working within the confines of what we have certified and that we have other development, namely Alameda Point, that falls behind it as listed in our housing element as a future path of providing more housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I can second that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, then I can very I can support that at direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a question. But that then include looking at rezoning to include senior housing. What what staff would come back with what is really kind of a conceptual plan and a timeline for the work we would have to do to do all the analysis to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yes, we took again copious notes about your issues, but we're just going to have to look to see what all we have to flesh out, because there will be a lot of issues in doing this, but we will bring that back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you get is this what you said you wanted us to do? And here's our projected timeline and what we think the steps might be, and we will bring that back. Thank you. So any other council comments seen?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to assume that everyone supports that direction. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Item three be Madam Chair. I might, um. I want to just offer for consideration. Ms.. Ott's presentations are going to be fairly lengthy and I think there's going to be a fair amount of discussion. And I think, as Councilmember Ashcraft mentioned, if we go past 11:00 this evening, since we had three meetings in a row past 11'",
        "'speaker_0': ', you'll have to vote to add permanent regular meetings for the rest of the year. So if you as an option, you can do that. But if you as an alternative, we've just been discussing that this is probably going to take more than an hour and we might want to look at another date to hear this item next'",
        "'speaker_0': 'week. It is a fairly full agenda, so I don't think that's going to be enough time. So we're thinking about potentially March 31st, which is the last Tuesday of the month. So we could agree to a date at a later time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at this point, you're asking us to, I think, have a motion to not continue with the balance of the agenda at this time. I don't know if we need a motion, but just maybe to consider an alternate time to hear this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you'd like to hear that item, we we can go forward. Obviously, Ms.. OT is prepared to do that. But I just want to let you know what the consequences of that would be and then potentially provide you with another option.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any member comments? Member de SAC. Oh, is your item.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you, Madam Mayor. I appreciate the suggestion by the assistant city manager, interim city manager to be. And I think for for interest of public involvement, perhaps we should take up her or suggestion and whatever the date is and you know, staff, you can tell us, but I think that's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm fine with that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member comes from Brody?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I don't want to give this short shrift. Shrift? Whatever. This is the mitigate portion of the alternative solution. So I think we need to give it all the time it needs and not cram it in in an hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So at this point, we don't need to agree upon a date at this point, do we? Well, that's why I was asking, do we have a date? We could continue it to a date certain between the hearing. The 31st by the vice mayor is not he's not available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So could we look at that offline? And at this point, though, not not set it for a date certain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can re notice it. I mean, notice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That we noticed, um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, so do we need a motion to notice it? Or it can? No, I think that the decision would be I guess you want to just close the meeting or you want to look that's left on the agenda, but not take this item and we will come back with it at a future date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So our city clerk is saying that it can't be any sooner than 12 days because of noticing what we would have if we adjourn this meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want to give the 12 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Notice which you wanted to do for this meeting, you could do a special meeting with seven days notice since this has already been out in the public. But any special meeting would have to have at least seven days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. This is my understanding we don't have a date within the next 12 days that we agreed on anyway. Outlined. Correct. So at this point, we could adjourned the meeting? Yes. Is there anything that's our last item. Any other member comments before I adjourn?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We will now during the meeting. Good evening. Thank you. Okay.'"
