Bonta and also to Karen Fong for the presentation tonight and the hard work that you've done putting this together over the many months. I think also a hearty thank you should go out to former council member Stuart Santa, who was very instrumental in putting this together.'",

Councilmember Bonta, who's now the first Filipino elected ever in the history of the state of California to the state assembly.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So I guess that's kind of fallen by the wayside, but it's good to refresh with some current choices. So thank you all for your hard work and really nice to see you. Young people, the students in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know you got your homework done before you came, so thank you for coming to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just I just want to say thank you for, for that presentation and thanks to the council for, uh, in most attention and lending work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also want to join in thanking all of you that are here this evening on this item. And I have a question. You had mentioned, Ms.. Fong, in regards to Japan that you're trying to get a substitute city in Japan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm curious, in regards to Sweden, if there's efforts to find another community within Sweden, since it appears that we no longer have an active relationship.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I actually have a relationship with the consul general of Japan and for another, a community involvement that I am with. But we have not made any contact with Sweden yet as of now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if there's anyone that in our community that's interested in assisting with, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Know, yes, quite frankly, we're a small organization and we're just now getting our feet going. So it's definitely in the works. We do. We definitely do want to establish reestablished communication with Sweden. I am back up here at the microphone and I really want it to just open it up to everybody in the chambers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now. If anybody is interested in joining Almeida's Sister City Association, please let us know. And we have some brochures out on the table out front and you know, you can join a committee or you can head a committee on your own if you'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we'd like to entertain that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just just for the record, I was just reminiscing. It was a lot of years ago when I was at Edison School. And I think I'm given the way our population has shifted in the current demographics, I think it's perfectly appropriate to have the sister city relationships that we have and that, you know, it takes energy, a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lot of energy to put these committees together. So I would really support just starting with what you're doing and and growing from there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it really takes effort to put the committees together. It actually takes even more effort to keep them going. We don't want to we don't want, you know, situations like a Rita and then to go away, I mean, to happen again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's just that's just not what we're about. Does it make sense to establish these relationships and then, oops, let them die? It's kind of like friendships, you know, we want to you want to foster those relationships and keep them going forever and ever time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, thank you. Q Item agenda item four.'",

The item before you this evening is a request by Mr. Jeff Canberra, who led the community engagement process for the rent review issue that was undertaken by the community starting in September of 2014.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When Mr. Canberra's presentation came before this council in January of this year, the Council gave direction to staff that we should move forward with drafting an ordinance that was based on five points aimed at strengthening the city's rent review advisory committee, and to work on those points that the community engagement process had yielded consensus on, and that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'while we were working on the draft ordinance language, if consensus was reached on the six point that we then would tackle that that issue to staff has been moving forward with the draft ordinance language and we are prepared to come back to council within the 90 days that was requested by the Council in January to publish so'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we would be able to make a presentation in in May. However, during this time, in conversations with Mr. Canberra, a request was made that we take a little time, allow the community process to continue on with staff's draft recommendations in hand.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's an opportunity to go back to the stakeholder groups that what staff's recommendations are prior to staff's presentation to the City Council, so that staff would have the benefit of that feedback and input from the community so that that's the direction we're seeking this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If council would like staff and Mr. Canberra to work together and send Mr. Canberra out on his community engagement process. We would then work with him to do that. I'm prepared to answer any questions and Mr. Canberra is here this evening also to answer any questions.'",

I also raised them in the public and I'm just going to mention them here and I'm mentioning the questions here, you know, to elicit not just'",
        "'speaker_5': 'staff's thoughts, but also to see what the public has to. What's on the public's mind. I think the key question that I have is and I'll just restated here, you know, what arguments have been raised or can be raised to say that to say that the community stakeholder groups are better or are better suited or less suited'",
        "'speaker_5': 'than legislative bodies like the Rent Review Advisory Board. When it comes to vetting the recommendations that you're putting together within the context of the original 90 day time frame. That's that's one of the questions. And yeah, I'll leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So I can do provide a brief answer. And then I think Mr. Campbell would like to also try to answer. And I would just say that I don't think that these two are mutually exclusive. I think that Jeff is preparing to go before the RAC at their April meeting and present to them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If this if this process is given the green light this evening by the Council, then Geoff will go before the RAC at their April 6th meeting to talk about the proposed changes. So with that, I'm just ask Mr. Campbell to come forward and give his thoughts on your question to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. Good evening, Mayor. Council members and staff. I'm Jeff Canberra, the community facilitator. So first of all, thank you. Councilmember de Song. I was able to get the questions, although it was a little late and I actually have responses to all three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you would like to hear those responses, I'd be happy to give them to you and then address any other questions that council may have. So the first one was the reason for the slight delay. A couple of things have happened since January 20th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a proposal from the Alameda Renters Coalition on point number six, which we did not have any consensus on when we first started. And that proposal is now going forward. We have some landlord support, not 100%. So I don't want to represent that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it has gotten some traction and I am continue to work through the housing provider groups in order to get counsel letters so that you can understand and see why there is a support for that. The next thing I think that's probably the most important is that when I came back to when I came to council in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'September, this was a pitch for a collaborative process. And initially that collaborative process involved two stakeholders, housing providers and tenants. There is now a third stakeholder and that is the city, and we want to continue to work collaboratively with the city so that not just tenant and landlord needs are taken care of, but also the city's concerns'",
        "'speaker_2': 'are take care of as well. So we've had a couple of issues that we were not able to address in our community process. One was the enforcement, which was definitely something that the city would be dealing with because neither tenants or landlords would propose how the city should enforce the provisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the second was any possible funding issues. While we had lots and lots of support for strengthening the rec, there was always a concern is that if there was an increased cost, how was that going to be paid for?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we needed the information from the city in order to be able to continue to build that collaboration so that when we do come back to you in the next 30 days, we are able to give you that collaboration of the three stakeholder groups and not just two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And finally, the discussion points that we had brought to you were somewhat conceptual. In fact, even then when we presented them, there was a discussion about, well, what does this mean and how would it be implemented? So now by seeing the hard language, then the two stakeholder groups working with the city will have the actual language of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'how it would operate. So we think we is better off to hear it ahead of time. Work out any of those may be small details. Get rid of any assumptions so that when we come back, we are speaking with a unified front.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In January, I was very fortunate to have both tenants and landlords here speaking. There were three of us with almost a total agreement. That's what we would be trying to do now. And also just to touch lightly is that Councilmember Desai would raise the issue that we are in crisis now, and I don't think anybody disagrees with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that. But what has happened since December is that we have stepped up as a community. There are now 540 members of the Alameda Renters Coalition. And because of the publicity that the community groups have gotten, the idea that there is a place where tenants can go to file a grievance with the RAC is that that is now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'being utilized? I'm not going to say any more than it has, but people are now aware of they were they were not aware of it before. The press has done a great job of educating as well. We are also now identifying the crisis situations prior to the RAC hearings and that the Alameda Renters Coalition Facebook page gets'",
        "'speaker_2': 'these situations coming to us earlier and were able to intervene and I have been privileged to have several of those come to me before they were even filed with the RAC. We have been able to resolve some and if not we have encouraged the tenants to file with the RAC so that these can be dealt with upfront'",
        "'speaker_2': '. We are now monitoring the RAC and that is tenants and landlords both and we believe that we're having pretty good success in resolving issues, even if the RAC doesn't resolve them. In January there was a property that noticed six rent increases at 18%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were there. We heard the presentation that housing provider was not going to accept the recommendation of the wrap after words. Landlords in this community contacted that landlord, and then that landlord agreed to the recommendations that the RAC had made at that hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as late as March the first Monday in March, where we also had another six rent increases, again, three of those have been resolved and I have been contacted to be an official mediator, uncompensated in the remaining three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To see if we'll be able to resolve those in the next 30 days. So we are being very active when we know about them to be able to resolve them. Obviously, there is some that we are not. Secondly, as Ms..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Potter said, that we are going to be going before the RAC in April with these six proposals. And if we can if we have the draft ordinance language, it will be presented at the RAC in detail for them to comment on as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, we'll all be there because we consider them one of our stakeholders since they're going to have to implement this. And finally, just to make sure that everybody is clear, we as a stakeholder group do not feel that we are the end result here of all this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That Council ultimately has the prerogative to accept what we are suggesting or to make recommendations of their own. What we're trying to do is present a more united front, though, so that you will know what the committee is thinking and what the community is thinking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And ultimately, for me, I believe that this is the best in participatory democracy, is that our community has come together to find resolutions that will work. So we're asking for the 30 days. We actually are not sure we needed it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But staff said they thought it was the best way so that we make sure we had the necessary time. So with that, I'm happy to answer any other questions, if there are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member questions? All right, this member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess I'm still confused what what we're going to get in 30 days that we don't have today, because I thought back in January we had an agreement to a conceptual framework of the five things staff was going to go back, draft the ordinance, and then the council was going to, as is our prerogative and our elected'",
        "'speaker_7': 'responsibility, that these in a public hearing where anyone in the public could come and speak and give comments and that if the six item was not resolved, I mean, I don't know. You know what? In my practice of law, it was always good to have deadlines, especially for settlement, because if you had a deadline, things always got'",
        "'speaker_7': 'done right at that deadline. And know, from what I'm hearing from other people in the community, this this number on item six, for those that don't remember, it was the number at which you would either go to the RAC or not go to the rack.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some people wanted a ten, so people wanted five. Some people wanted zero, I guess. No. If you can't decide, then, you know, we're kind of the deciders we were elected to be. The deciders will be the deciders. I mean, I don't know what this thing needs to get done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, it's been six months already, and I'm just a little bit concerned about adding another 1 to 2 months to the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you're you are correct that the process that you just outlined is the process that staff has been following. So we have been working on the draft ordinance language and we will be bringing forward that direction at the January meeting was to publish our recommendations in 90 days, which is the end of April, for a main meeting'",
        "'speaker_3': '. The request has been that. The community, stakeholders that participated going into this and reached consensus on the five points might benefit from having staff's recommendations vetted and discussed prior to coming back to the Council, and that it may be more efficient and effective by way of a process rather than, you know, doing it at the council meeting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and then following up and coming back again. But that's it's really why staff has come back before the council and requested direction from the council because we were prepared to work either way. And we're we're, you know, we're happy to take the direction of the Council on this process piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Mr. Spencer And I think, Ms.. Parrish, you just answered at least part of a question I had, which was what is to stop members, ranchers from coming to our public meetings and having input on the proposals that you would bring before us the next time you appeared?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I, I to I think I agree with what member Odie said, especially remembering that this process was first introduced before prior council and it wasn't a unanimous vote. That doesn't matter in a democracy majority rules. But the reason, given the argument given for outsourcing, if you will, and by the way, I should have said at the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'outset, I think all of us unanimously really, really appreciate all the time and effort and goodwill that Mr. Campbell has put into this this endeavor. So thank you very much. But the rationale for outsourcing is what I will call it outside of the council, because really this is a council prerogative, is that if you did it within'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the council, it just slows things down. It takes longer. And this is a problem that faces us, faces our renters right here, right now today. And so I am concerned with extending that timeline out still further when I feel all this, you know, is probably the discussion our council will get into.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I feel that this is a city council responsibility. The council, the stakeholders can still address the City Council about any proposals that staff comes forward with. I, too, am aware that a coalition of landlords has been reaching out to landlords who are had been suggesting some more excessive increases.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's something from my conversations with the landlords community, it's something they've always done and they're stepping up their efforts to do it even more so, which is a lovely ad hoc effort. I think they will do it regardless of whether council steps in from here on out or or Mr. Canberra holds on to the process'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a little longer. But I think especially when you're talking about possible amendment to the municipal code amending procedure to the the RAC, the rental resource and Rental Rate Advisory Committee. That to me just sounds like our city attorney's office use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The staff who deals with this really need to be involved. So I feel like this is the time for it to come back into the council and the staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Okay. Well, I have a comment. So before we start going around again, you don't think at this point and I'm going to. So I would be amenable to going along with Mr. Cameron's recommendations. My understand there are no speakers on this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I'm confident that this was shared with landlords and tenants before came to us this evening. So. So I would have expected there to be landlords and tenants here to express another opinion if they didn't think that this was the best way to proceed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And given that, that makes me think I would do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Go ahead, finish.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you want to respond to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I did want to respond to that because I did not blast out to all of my 125 contacts that there was going to be a request for a 30 day extension. So I cannot tell you in good conscience that this has been distributed to every member of the community so that they are aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that this talk about from the Alameda Renters Coalition was aware that we were doing it, but it never came before the HRC as an official. Requests. So I don't want to misrepresent me being up here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you can remind us, she represents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda Renters Coalition 540 friends on a Facebook page.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my I think she's been very effective at representing them. And so personally that tells me that she's willing to defer to your recommendation and how I would interpret that, since she's not here tonight or anyone opposed to, you know, oppose your recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, what I, I did contact this talk about we did talk about this. And she said that if she was able to make it tonight, she yes, she would have spoken about the democratic process and being able to participate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what I can tell you, because we had the conversation, because I've been texting her to see if she could make it. I would like to make one point, though, because way back when, when this council voted three two to move forward, it was with the understanding that we would be able to move faster.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I want to make sure that the council is clear that we did move much faster because under the task force proposal, the recommendation was not to come back until May or early June, and then the council would have been taking action from that recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We came to this council in January with five of six proposals that were agreed to, for the most part, by the community. And now between January and February have come up with. What was the deal breaker back in January, which nobody thought we would ever come to any agreement on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And now there is some consensus. So the fact that we would be able to come back to you with more definite language, we don't think you will have to deal with that split the way you would otherwise. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then so so I have another concern. I have. Why? Why I've been supportive of the process and and new working with landlords and tenants to strengthen the rec. And I attended the last meeting. I, I agree with your representation of what occurred, and I'm very happy to hear that the owner has now been working to accept'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the recommendation and they had several cases. My understanding is one had settled, one went the direction in favor of the landlord and one in favor of the tenants and the members. I thought did a really good job of working with the community to settle cases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my my interest in settling the cases is for those right for those of us that don't know about what rent control can do and what it can't do. If we had rent control, it would not address the issues of every tenant in this community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And maybe our counsel could shed some light on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Just briefly. I think the issue here is and with this committee and what staff has been supporting is strengthening the rent review advisory committee, not doing rent control. And I think what the mayor is mentioning is there's apparently some sentiment in the community that that's not enough, that really the issues are so egregious'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that the council should be considering the possibilities of doing rent control. And while my office has not been asked by this council to do any major analysis of that issue, you have rather focused on strengthening the Rent Review Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think the mayor's point is that the problem with rent control is it's very difficult in the state of California. It's not an easy concept. The law is such that Costa Hawkins provides that it would, if you can adopt rent controls, it only applies to properties built prior to February 1995.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It only applies to properties that are not individually personalized. So that would mean if it's a single family home, if it's a condominium, it would not apply even if it was built before 1995. So it's limited in its application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's limited and difficult in how it is enforced. And that's why I believe the mayor's concerned particularly and of council members, are that the best approach? And I think what Mr. Cameron, his committee has been looking at is rather strengthening the rent review advisory committee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which can apply to every renter in our town. Which is why I support any recommendation at this point of view, continuing to work with our landlords and tenants, because long term that is the best solution to best serve all of our tenants in our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My opinion, yes. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a question that I think I heard that are 90 days from the January 20th is the second meeting of April, is that correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we would publish the the staff report, which is the 12 days before the meeting. So we would publish at the end of April for the May 5th Council meeting would have been that we promised. Our commitment was to publish the the recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm. And what Mr. Cambria suggesting is within the envelope of that time, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not to extend beyond that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, but the idea is that or the disclosure that we were making in the staff report is that we could go beyond the 90 days just because it takes time to convene your meetings, hold your meetings, get your feedback from the community and, you know, book a room.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just kind of the logistics of it may require a little more time. So we just wanted to kind of do full disclosure to the council. If we undertake the community process that's being requested that it could just add a little more time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we're not expecting that it's going to add a lot of time. And if the council kind of to council member Otis Point wants to set kind of a new deadline to have everyone being held to the fire on that, we would do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think Mr. Camber would endeavor to do as much of the community engagement work that he could do within that time frame.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is it on just that one point?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the I think that it's the community engagement would address two issues. One, we would have for the community to work with the draft ordinance language and then the consensus on point six that we could fold in if if there was sufficient consensus such that that council could act on all of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When it comes to the council with a staff report and a draft ordinance, that's what we're preparing for. Staff's consideration is a draft ordinance to address those five points that really give more more teeth to the rec effort and work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the other things that's uncertain right now is that we were not going to be going before the Iraq until April 5th. And we don't know exactly what they are going to be saying about all this great work that we have done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it would be nice to have their input as well. And so as and as part of said, we're kind of hedging our bets just a little bit and then getting all of the cats together in one room to be able to address all of those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madumere Thank you. See, I think the way what you just said kind of began to kind of illustrate a different path that we're talking about. The path that I believe typically happens is especially including when when volunteer community members are involved, volunteer community members raise an issue, take part in formulating what are the questions and what are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the answers. Staff puts together, you know, a formal response and then see and the volunteer members review those responses and give their recommendations. And staff is then moving forward and and putting it through the process. And one of the process would be the the legislative body, in this case the Rent Review Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the rent review advisory boards ask is to report to the city council. Because what you just said is that the rent review advisory board is going to report the. The housing task of the volunteer group.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's great review is going well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hold on. So to me it's not clear as to what we're talking about about this, you know, three days to 60 days. To me, it seems as though if the one core issue is that you want the community members, the Rent Renters Coalition to get involved in the argument that I have to hear is that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At the rent that the process that we have in place now, the 90 day time frame, somehow precludes a substantive involvement by the by the community members. And I'm not and I'm listening for an argument as to why it's exclusive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to me, the way that it's unfolding is. We've got this 90 day time frame. And in April, staff is going to have a report regarding their their, you know, how we should change the ordinance and then up to and even immediately after the report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why can't the community group give their substantive input, however they so choose, and still influence the Rent Review Advisory Board and subsequently influence the City Council? To me, it's. I just need to hear the argument that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So maybe maybe a way of looking at this and approaching this is that we as staff could publish the draft ordinance language sooner than the typical time frame for getting the packet out sooner than the 12 days we could get the the draft ordinance out within the next week and a half and that it could go before'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the RAC or the community engagement could happen kind of during the month of April and it would get as far as it would get before everything comes to the council in May as scheduled. So rather than the 12 day window, we would be providing something more like a 30 day window.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that could be the time frame in which the community engagement process could happen and we could meet the schedule and it would get as far as it would get. The one I mean, that's a possibility.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The one problem with that is it's altogether possible that the rent review advisory board members will have one opinion as to how ordinance language should be crafted with regard to the Rent Review Advisory Committee, and that opinion might be different from the rent group.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it seems as though somehow those two have to be reconciled or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that's the point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would just reflect that in our staff report to the council that the feedback from both of those entities would be reflected in the staff report for council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But but my point, though, is that the Rent Review Advisory Board asked to also comment on the pluses and minuses of what what the Rent Renters Coalition has to offer. That's why the Renters Coalition has to comment on the staff report when it's issued.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Those comments have to be part of the public decision making when it goes for the Rent Review Advisory Committee. And the Rent Review Advisory Committee then gives its recommendations to City Council. Right now you're talking about two parallel tracks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They might coincide or they might.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think the distinction might be, and I alluded to this earlier, is that there are now three stakeholder groups as far as I think at least I am concerned. There is the renters, there's the housing providers and the staff, and the three of us are trying to work together so that whatever staff comes up with that'",
        "'speaker_2': ', we look at that and as the two other stakeholder groups and make sure that we can all come to an agreement before it comes to the council. So it's a slightly different role, but our stakeholders want to be involved in all of the decision making process, not that it's going to usurp the council's authority, but I think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it's better if we can all come together in an agreement. And I know that tenants and landlords are going to understand the position that staff is in. The idea is trying to come to an agreement. I believe we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Back in September, nobody said any of this was going to work. And then we came here and we got five out of six and people said the sixth wasn't going to work. And here we are in the beginning of March with six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now it's not uniform, but people have been talking. We view the staff as our partner. We view Vive. We view the RAC as our stakeholder partner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not clear as to what you mean by the city staff being a stakeholder, but I'll just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll just leave it at that. Enforcement. We can't talk about enforcement. Only the staff can do that. And so we've had informal discussions about how enforcement might be. That hasn't gone back out to the stakeholders. And I can tell you, depending on how enforcement works, we could undo part of the agreement that we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there are serious funding issues, we might undo the agreements that we have so far because some of them were predicated on certain presumptions. But we couldn't address those presumptions because staff wasn't involved. And that's why we want them here now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I alluded to them earlier. Enforcement and funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What if there is a funding issue? I mean, isn't that for the council to decide, especially if there's a budget allocation? I guess I'm a little confused because I thought the original charge of the community committee was to put together recommendations to bring to the Council on High Level Principles, and the Council would discuss them as we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'did. And then we, as is our responsibility, give direction to staff to draft an ordinance based on those all five of those principles. And then the sixth one, I guess I'm. I'm a little confused that I think. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought only the council gave direction to staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It seems like. It does seem a little usurping, to be honest with you. And the mayor made some good points about the value of of of the rack and how important it is and how important it has become.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what we're trying to do here is strengthen it. And it seems to me that given the crisis that Councilmember De described, we want to strengthen that sooner rather than later. And we've already drag this out like a really long time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think it's time that if you can't decide, we'll decide for 21520322, whatever it is. I mean, that's our job. That's that's our responsibility. And I don't know why we keep dragging this out any longer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'd like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any other member comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On that issue? So for me, my concern on that pushing for saying anything from our position down is that we depend on the landlords and the tenant and RAC to solve these problems. We actually cannot intervene in a lease between a landlord and a tenant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You and I cannot get involved in that. That is why we have RAC and that is why it is so important that I think why why in fact, we've had so much participation in this issue and trying to encourage landlords and tenants within our community to work together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And by that, I mean actually monitor the rent increases, which is what has been happening. And I'm very encouraged that we have more a lot of. In the past we had many tenants that were not aware of RAC, even though RAC has been in existence for many years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is a good thing. Now, I think that we have had tenants utilize RAC, they've been working with the landlords and RAC and reaching resolutions and which is why I continue to support this process because it is through them that we actually have the teeth to encourage RAC to be effective to protect our tenants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You and I cannot do that on our own. We can't do it with rent control for actually many of our renters, which is why it is, I think, why you have landlords stepping up and tenants stepping up actually not just for themselves, but as a group, which is very powerful and I think has been successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's my concern about taking our approach and and why why I support continuing to work with the landlords and the tenants and RAC and Mr. Cameron's staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I. I think those are all valid points and valid goals. I mean, first of all, we haven't decided what we're gonna do with rent control and it's not before us. I don't think that's something we could talk about, but.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Your point about it being of the RAC being a valuable asset to the city and a valuable asset to the tenants and landlords to resolve issues? I totally agree with that. But we're not trying to take away the rack process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not trying to say don't go to rack. You know, we're not trying to take that power to have you or I or any other council member mediate rent disputes. What we're trying to do is strengthen a process that we all agree is beneficial to the community, beneficial to tenants, beneficial to landlords in resolving disputes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're delaying the ultimate strengthening of that process. And I think we've delayed long enough. I mean, I agree with all of the points you made about the value of of the rack and the value of the process. But I don't think we're doing anything today to take away from that process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I do think that, you know, the community the community voice and the community analysis of issues, that's that's the city council. I mean, we put out an agenda with a policy position, a staff recommendation, and the community comes to the meetings and they have input.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They say, we like it, we don't like it in that is the community process. So I just think that, you know, we're kind of adding an extra layer of bureaucracy that's probably not necessary to come up with the ultimate community process, which we're all going to have to decide on eventually.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Member Ashcraft You know, I'm I'm pretty much going to echo that. I think that we've long known the value of the rack and what it needed needs is more teeth. And I, I would not want to see us delay giving it more teeth.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the process that Ms.. Potter has started with staff takes us well down that road. And I would in fact, I'm ready to call for the vote. I'm I think that I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Outside us. There were no public comments on this. And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just want to let you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know, I mean, no one had turned in a slip. We have a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no. So, actually, Miss Hawk about just arrived. And so if counsel had any questions for her, she can be part of our process, if that's okay. Or we can get a speakership if somebody had questions on how the tenants felt.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just for the record, I'll note that I don't think we had any emails I didn't about this item from the time the staff report was published until today. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm interested in allowing her to speak at this point. Did any or any objection to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We hope in the coming weeks. And if that's not close.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why not?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So if you'd like to speak, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was never open because we didn't have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor. And members of the city council. I'm Angela Hawk about from the Alameda Renters Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm here because we didn't get a whole lot of notice about the questions that Councilmember De Saag had. But we are fully confident.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the process that has been put forward by Jeff camera. And I understand that the city council is very capable of hearing renters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But because this is such.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A huge crisis, we can't usually wait for like two weeks to meet with the city council. We need to be working with people as soon as possible who have the power.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The landlords actually have the power to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deal with these.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rate increases. So any group, organization that allows us to interact in a positive way is hugely important.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to be able to have that process be a part of a political process as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is is amazing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The fact that we were able to come together and talk and that we still have this opportunity to take a look at what city staff puts forth as actual written ordinances is invaluable because. We're actually able to sit across the table.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With landlords and instead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of like each of us talking independently in front of city council members, we're actually having an opportunity to listen to landlords and hear their concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And usually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Renters aren't very excited to hear that that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Perspective. But once landlords hear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The renters perspective and renters hear the landlords perspective, there's a lot more equanimity, there's a lot more cooperative ness and an overall willingness to stand behind ordinances that might actually work. So I urge you city council not to discount the work that Jeff Canberra Bellamy to renters coalition and the landlords who are coming to the table and'",

And it's happening all over the place. And even though I hear that they're asking for an extra month, I'm confident that we will be able to get the consensus from the other landlords well'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in advance of that time, and we might still be able to meet the original date. So I urge you to give us a chance, and I really thank you for listening to me this evening.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Saag. Thank you, Mayor Spencer. The comments and the questions that I have raised, the essence of which was basically. Why can't we stick to the time frame that was agreed to in January and within that time frame will allow for substantive input by the rent people?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I have not yet heard a strong argument why it can't happen within the time frame. Now let's get to the other side. We can say, well, what's the harm in in, you know, extending this out? Well. There are several issues here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, as a city council, I think the first thing is there's a lot of important issues that that we as a city council have to deal with. And at some point in time, we have to make the decision and we have to, you know, go through the process of involving everyone, getting all the best input that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we can. And we do it within a timeframe. And the extent that that timeframe was initially reasonable. And you know, there's a certain point in time when we have to decide or it goes back to the issue. The question that I had is, why can't we work within the timeframe that was agreed to and why does that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'harm in any way? The Renters Coalition from sensitively contributing within the time frame. I just haven't heard an argument as to why we need an extra 30 days to 60 days. It's not just 30 days, but it's 30 days or 60 days on top of the 90 day time frame that we put.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, we could easily just say, sure, okay. You know, it's good politics, you know, to say to you guys, okay, you know, your 500 members strong, you're very active through your Facebook. You know. Sure. You know, you can have that extra time frame.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we have to make decisions here. You know, we're constantly being asked to delay decisions because somebody, you know, didn't feel that they were part of a process that perhaps had been going on. At the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, what matters the most is that there is a substantive decision that makes sense and that the community was involved and had avenues for being involved. And I do believe that that is the case. If we stay within the 90 to 90 day timeframe agreed to in late January, we could, you know, do 30 days to'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a weeks in between. Beyond, I think there's ample time to get what's in our 90 day period to get what needs to be done on item six, as well as input on a draft ordinance and meet the current timetable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I, I'd make a motion that we stick with the current timetable, with the understanding that the groups are going to continue to meet doesn't preclude it, and that there is a two week additional between the first reading and the second reading of the ordinance by an additional time to adjust, to tweak, to receive new input, just'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Remember I said two quick questions. One, and this is in response to an email that I received today. And I think I know the answer. But just for public clarification, this is the maintenance facility. This is not a ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not a ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the other question, I think at the previous meeting, I may have attributed some comments to you about the relocation of SEALs to the breakwater. I think those weren't really from you. Okay. So I want to apologize for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's fine. I swear.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't talk about the operating noise, but that was also included in the mitigated negative declaration. And they they were there was no significant impact on that. I only discuss the two that had the had considered an impact and needed a mitigation but the rest of it now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But those could be a topic at the planning board. Yes. Yes. Permit is discussed. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And with regard to a couple of emails that I also received ahead of the meeting, there was reference made to the fact that at the ferry terminals which indeed use we to vessels parking has been a problem. So two points, if you could clarify for me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're not talking about parking for ferry passengers at this facility and then I'll just throw out what I know, which is that we the and the city are very actively working on solutions to the ferry, parking at both the Main Street and the Harbor Bay ferry terminals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know because I've been involved in a couple of meetings and I was also heartened to hear that the Transportation Commission is soon going to consider a range of parking alternatives and solutions for the Harbor Bay Ferry. So even though that's separate in a part, people hear the term, we don't tend to to lump them together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's not something that we're considering tonight. But just so the public who's listening knows those issues are not being swept under the carpet, they're being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And questions that any other members have questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I had questions. Could you clarify? Is my understanding that to approve the list tonight, it requires four votes from council? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. Our city charter requires that for a lease over a year, which this is, it requires four votes of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And within the MRU and regard to the hall out, for instance. When that comes back, it would be mutually agreed upon for council. How many votes for that require?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor, the you that is before you. There are actually two separate items, action items before you in this item that we've been talking about together. One is to consider approval of the memorandum of understanding with we have related to the hall out that requires three votes of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other action item is the second, the final enactment of the ordinance which would approve the lease with Aida. And that requires four votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in regard to rent at some date in the future, there appears to be. But is what is determined a mutually agreeable site? Would it require three votes from council to agree or four votes from council to agree?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'McNamara I'm not sure that that would even come back to council. The idea is that the parties would, through the EMU, there would be agreement as to where the site would be, if there would need to be an amendment to the EMU that would have to come back to council and that would require three votes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think the authority is for staffs of both entities to be able to work that out through the process of getting permits from the various agencies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so then can you clarify? It would not be in regards to when staff works through a process and works through a process and determines what they think is an appropriate place for the hall out. It does not come back to council for agreement or any vote at that time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's strictly between reader and staff to determine the what they think is a mutually agreeable location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Primarily. And then, of course, whatever, whatever pruning or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Permitting process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Required, then they would have to agree to it. It would not necessarily have to come back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Would it also involve whatever consultation we did say with the National Marine Fisheries Service? So even though parties, I understand from the lease refers or from the EMU refers to the city and Rita, it would also be their consultants, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. We really I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We want to get this right. And so we don't want to just tear down something that serving a population and then and put it just anywhere. So we do want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It kind of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my question goes to right now, and we heard this on the prior item, we this allows the public to come and weigh in when an item comes before council. And I want to clarify that. If this vote if this lease is approved, then I actually the the NYU does not require four votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Only requires three. And then from that point forward, if the menu is approved, then the item does not come back to council the public there. Their path of input would be to communicate with staff, but it would not be on an agenda item here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the determination by council, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That? That is correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then in regards to these other issues that I appreciate you sharing are not part of the lease. For instance, the the design of the building, for instance, the height. But it looks like that will be determined through the ironing board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then does that come back to council for approval? It would only come back to council if somebody peel the planning board decision and then at that point, how many votes would require to approve the design of the building?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council acts by three votes unless specifically required by charter to act by four. So it would be three votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then so in regards to transportation of fuel, since that item is not addressed specifically in the lease, I want to clarify again that that if it ever comes back, it would require about three votes of council, not for it to prove, for instance, any issue regarding storage of the fuel or transportation of the fuel'",
        "'speaker_4': '. M.R. Unless there's something in the lease that would have to be amended, unless the lease needs to be amended, that would require four votes. If it is something else, it is part of the menu or part of some other permit or whatever that might have to come back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It would be three votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. A member, Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just a quick clarifying question to when it comes to a planning board appeal, because that costs a lot of money. Sometimes council members appeal a planning board decision and bring it to city council for four decisions. So if there are concerns at the planning board level about design related issues and a council member could take it upon'",
        "'speaker_5': 'herself or himself to appeal, it would save money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, at that point, regardless, it's still three votes as opposed to four. The only time. Correct. All right. Number Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just for clarification, Ms.. Marcano, I think if I recall reading the lease for the last meeting, those items of the fuel storage and and, you know, how the ships are fueled and the protection from spillage and response planning all are all contained in the lease that we voted on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The lease document is talk specifically about the types of the storage units and things like that. Yeah. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. And and I would just add that I think, you know, these council discussions are very useful for helping to work out the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kind of going to be clarifying question. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So I mean, this is what we're going to continue to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, are you asking the question?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's well, we'll have that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just one more. Can you tell us what the property's zoned for right now? Excuse me. What's the zoning of the property? Isn't it commercial maritime use? Open space. Open space?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's in the tidelands. So it's maritime open space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So there are limited.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But limited uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Limited uses. And this is one of the they use. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I could get some clarification from Wheater, if you don't mind. On the seal, haul out. You know for certain you'll have to get a permit from D.C..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think, Mr. Conley, they'd like you to come up so you can. Speaking to the microphone in. Someone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Kevin Connolly, Water Emergency Transportation Authority Planning Manager. The question is from the assistant city manager here. Yes. Okay. I'm going to answer that question right after I answer the first question about the zoning. Enterprise for zoning district requires.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what it is. It's not open space for zoning. It's enterprising person. You speak in the microphone, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Utah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Can you kind of explain to us what that means.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please? You can ask the plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I it's not fair to ask him. I think someone from city. State. Yeah. To explain what enterprise zoning means. Yes. Okay. Ms.. Ms.. That possibly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Expert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there's actually two parts to their project. One of them is in the piers, the piers in the water and some and it's adjacent. It's in an open space district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adjacent to or used to call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Enterprise Park. There's the fueling station, which.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is an enterprise for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which is for maritime commercial businesses. And so it's actually within state lands.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so there are a lot of uses that aren't allowed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In that area. But this is exactly the type of use that's consistent with the zoning for the Enterprise for.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'It. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, miss. Could you clarify that you were speaking in regards to the fueling station falls within this enterprise zone. And what about the building? And then what about the ferry or the ferries for that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the actual part of the piers are in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The water.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'For the actual buildings when the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Open space district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the whole thing is in the open space district of the. And an open space includes buildings. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can and we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's what we were just looking at, the zoning map.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the fueling station.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is within the enterprise for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in regards to where the ferries will be. What is that? It's how is that treated?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's within the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Water portion of the property. And I'm just I just don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know off the top of my head what the property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is exactly how the water the submerged property is zoned. But I think it will just we'll have to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just don't know if that got my head.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Members. Did you have any other questions? I do. In regards to our attorney or counsel, in regards to enforcement of an MRU versus a lease. What are the differences? For instance, if the if there's an issue with the haul out that's in the mail, you as opposed to having that language in the lease itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, the M.O. you provides, I think as Ms.. Mercado identified and in the M.O., you for the fallout, that the way it is structured is that the widow will have to put $100,000 into an escrow account. And they are committed also to doing various to getting the permits and identifying the site and constructing the hall out and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'utilizing that $100,000 toward completion of that. And they have to do it on a particular deadline, and they are not to begin construction and pull permits until they have accomplished that. And if the city believes that they have failed to meet those deadlines and they are not adequately and diligently moving forward, the city can go ahead and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do what Ms.. Makana calls self-help and go ahead and and complete the project itself and utilize that hundred thousand dollars. So those are fairly substantial ability to to be able to enforce those obligations. The lease itself is a property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And it's, you know, complicated as to what the default provisions would be and the requirements that you have to go through to enforce a lease. But ultimately, you can terminate a lease and, you know, take the property back and pursue whatever remedies there might be at LA Equity pursuant to the lease.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if this if if we do has issues completing the hall out for whatever reason, then the city can do self-help and step up and utilize this $100,000 to complete it. And if it takes more than $100,000, then what does the city do?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the MCU doesn't really doesn't have language about if it costs more than $100,000. But what we do know is that we can go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To our.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Partner and amend the MCU. I mean, I think that I mean. If we're self helping, that means that they haven't fulfilled their obligation. But I think what they have committed to is help is getting the the hall out there are putting the hall out in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And what if there's not a mutually agreeable location for the hall out? Does the project still continue? I think finding a location has to be the first order of business that we need to work on, because in order to design and figure out what it's going to look like, we have to find a location.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obstacles that we've.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Had or the reason.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't have one now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Number one is because we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Don't own all the water.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The seaplane lagoon is still owned by the Navy. It's not even on our lease. And so we couldn't put something in the seaplane lagoon. So we're just trying to figure out a logical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Location for this whole layout.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Working with biologists and experts to figure out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What makes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sense. And if we if it makes sense that it goes into the seaplane lagoon or if it goes under the piers, we've just got to figure out where, what side, what makes sense. I mean, I talked to Dr. Allen today, and one of the things that she talked about is that we need to determine why the SEALs'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are coming to this location. Are they coming for foraging or are they coming for recreation? And that that actually informs where you going to put your call out? However, it would not be considered a breach of the lease to not complete a bridge to not complete an additional the new hall out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The list does not speak to the hall at the MO you speaks to the hall loud and what we but what the MRU does say is that the only delay that the city will allow them not to build is for the third party, not getting the third party permitting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So everything else, they should be moving on. We should be moving on together. The only the only thing that we're really giving them any kind of a pass for holding up is if they can't get these permits from AC, DC or whomever else needs to weigh in on it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So. But since that's since the fallout is in a separate NYU and not part of the lease, the lease continues. Separate from the more you separate from the hall out to two documents, two different parts of work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is correct. I don't know if this helps or not, correct me here, but the idea is if potentially you approve both of these documents tonight and for some reason, so the lease goes into effect and Rita has to begin to pay their lease payments and they are expecting to begin doing construction, but they can't begin the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'construction until they have satisfied the requirements of the EMU and the hall out. So the city will have leased the property, will have a tenant, will be getting rental payments. But frankly, if we do doesn't build this building, we're still going to get lease payments and have a tenant out there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. We have speakers that. Yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, and I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rita.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer and council members. My name is Nina Rannells and I am the executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority. Thank you for hearing our item today. I'm here to thank you for your consideration of the item and your support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have worked with the city since 2008 on this project. First, in looking at and identifying a site for it and then working through the various planning and development environmental permit consultation processes and in working to secure funds to actually ultimately move to construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's been a long conversation and we're really excited to be here today. This represents a significant milestone in the in the process and in delivering this project. It represents a very important part of our operation. It's a key component of our core infrastructure that will support our services that we provide to the city of Alameda and the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'residents of Alameda and surrounding areas. With your support tonight, we are prepared to move forward quickly on work to establish a new and lasting steel hall out. As outlined in the memo U. We are a proud partner with the city in providing ferry services to this community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when we transition when the services transition from the city to us in 2012, we've done a significant amount of work since then to secure significant funds, to implement projects, to rehabilitate and improve those services, including adding over $2 million annually in operating dollars to support the system and to provide actually service improvements, as well as about'",
        "'speaker_3': '$50 million to support rehabilitating the terminal sites, gangways ramps, bicycle parking, parking lots, as well as more. Most importantly, about $45 million to invest in the four boats that that we inherited two of them money for two of them to undergo mid-life overhauls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're in the process of going out to bid to actually build two new boats, to replace boats that have met the end of the end of their useful life. We are your partner. We love providing services to your community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are committed to the city of Alameda wholeheartedly in what we do every day. And we thank you for your support tonight and look forward to moving forward with this important project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any questions for to. At this point, council members. Thank you. Right? Right. Then I'm going to proceed with calling the public speakers. I believe this is Captain Ray Shipway and then Mark Klein and then Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this livecast.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. He's in the back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor Council members. My name is Raymond Shipway. I'm the regional representative. California Regional Representative of the International Organization of Master Mason Pilots United Inland Group. I represent 350 members in our specialized fleet, but that big title just means I'm the head of the complaint department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have several things that I have to do in conjunction with being head of the complaint department. And I. One of the most enjoyable things I got to do was was advocate for the funds from the Federal Transportation Administration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were able to go two years ago to Washington, D.C., as we do every year for an event called the Sale End, where we actually advocate for items that are necessary for the maritime fleet. And when I go back there, of course, I'm California, born and raised in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I did 20 years as a tugboat driver here in San Francisco Bay. That's where the title came from. But the idea that we can go back there and advocate for for big ticket items and shipping and all that sort of stuff is great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I went down there and became I had to use the term maverick, but I visited our local delegation who were very responsive and very receptive to the idea that we needed to do something for our folks local here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So on behalf of my members and the folks that work for the WTA and and the and the hardworking staff and crew that put together all this program, our hard work in, in getting those original funds and helping out with with this program is a matter of pride for myself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I thank you for allowing us the opportunity to come before you and speak. We look forward to putting this together and and making a good investment in Alameda and talking to you folks about ferries is is like preaching to the choir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was here in 1998 when we had a real contentious thing going on between who was going to provide ferry service between blue and gold and Roger Murphy. And if you all remember that, I kind of got myself in the middle of that as a guppy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, again, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Please, if you have the opportunity to support this, I thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Aren't clean.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My last council meeting, I spoke and said a verbal promise wasn't enough and we should have something in writing. And you now you have a signed memorandum of understanding. So I thank you for that. And. Few days ago, someone asked me if I could dig up an expert to help plan a seal haul out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I inquired at the Marine Mammal Center and from an official when he came back with a name. Sarah Ellen. So I hope you can work some something out. And that would. Maybe work. Of course, one should always recognize that when you're working with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wild animals, nothing ever is guaranteed, but hopefully something can be worked out. Just as a final note. I must say, if I had known about this a few years ago, I would have opposed the present site for this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The site would be better as a park, and it seems to me that the estuary side, which is more industrial and with its ferries going in and out anyway, would have been a better location. But that I know that train has left the station and that's just my $0.02.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I hope it goes okay and we get a hold out for the SEALs. Thank you. Evening, Madame Mayor. Members of the council. My name's Andy Slick. I'm going to be wearing three hats tonight. First is, I'm a long time resident homeowner of the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm also a representative for the Carpenters Union here in Alameda County. And for the sake of time, it's starting to get a little late. I'll be speaking on behalf of the Alameda County Building Trades Council. So I feel and the council and the Carpenters also feel that this is a good project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a good example of cooperative labor management in the building of the project. There's going to be a project labor agreement in that. It's always a pleasure to be up here speaking with an agency that values working families, as we do does.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's a partnership that you as the council, should look at moving forward when you're looking at building out at the base and the commitments to working families and project labor agreements. So this is the type of project that the base needs that Almeida needs to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would encourage you to implement police and the right way and move this project forward. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Michael McDonagh and then Alex Knox. And then Marcel. There is all our. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madame Mayor, council staff Michael McDonough, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. You know, this sounds like a great project for Alameda. I'm excited that it would be the first breaking of ground at the new Alameda base that we've got out there now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's good for business, too. There's 100 new employees. There is new infrastructure. And the maritime industry is one of the most important industries we have on the island. And I think this is a good extension of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we are all for it at the Chamber of Commerce. Commerce and urge you to approve this lease and the IMO you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alex Knox.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Chair, City Council, City Staff My name is Alex Knox. I'm the director of Community Relations for Richmond Mayor Tom Butt. And I know you have a lot of speakers on this. I don't want to take up a lot of your time, but I am here to support your adopting this lease agreement with Wheeler because I see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it as one of the the many exciting opportunities and initiatives where we can see mutual benefit through regional partnership. You know, I know we do spend a lot of a lot of time developing this project with the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have also spent a lot of time with we are developing our expanded ferry service in Richmond and. Part of why I'm here today is because in order for us to realize our goal of having very service enrichment, we need this maintenance facility to go forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the tables were turned, I think the kind of proposal that that's before we do it today would be something that the city of Richmond would be really excited to. To look at the jobs, the additional emergency preparedness it provides for a transit increase, public access, bay trail upgrades, the sidewalks, lighting and your main street ferry terminal'",
        "'speaker_2': '. All all elements that I think are very attractive. In order for us to continue these exciting regional cooperations, we need to we need to be able to take these big steps. And this step will lead to another, which will ultimately lead to another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in that we can realize a more robust transit network in the Bay Area that serves all the cities and all the residents. And if approved, I would hope that the city council and the city staff will move to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Move this project forward in a expedited manner, because we really do believe that this this could help us all quite a bit. And with that, thank you. Thank you so much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for coming tonight all the way from Richmond. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Marcel. And then Chad, Rick Smalley and then Leslie Cameron.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor, and members of the City Council. My name is Preston Dula and I'm speaking on behalf of Marcel. He had to leave early. I'm. I'm a carpenter. And in the union. And my life has been building community improvement projects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've dedicated my life to that. As well as a long time resident in Alameda. And I'd really like to encourage you guys to promote this project with this project forward. Improve the IMO you and please let's put some residents to work because I'm one of those residents and I really want to support this community and make a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'better life for my family in this type of projects. That helps me do that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Madam, or Member City Council and Chadwick Smalley, Capital Projects Manager with the City of Richmond. Just to reiterate an Alex Knox message, we're very excited about this project. We understand it's critical to the expansion of the regional transit system that we have operates and we encourage the City Council to approve the lease and more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You we feel strongly that a 30 minute high quality transit ride from Richmond to San Francisco is a deal changer. I mean, it's it's a big it gets folks off the I-80 corridor, which today is is a mess and it can only get worse from here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the regional environmental impacts of this project are significant. The environmental benefits of this project are significantly significant to the city of Richmond and the entire region. So we just want to ask for your support and voice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lastly camera and I'll be Carrie Thompson and then Phil Holt.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, Madam Mayor. Vice Mayor, council members and staff. My name is Leslie Cameron, and along with my husband Alan Cameron, and my business partners, Bill and Vicki Elliott, we own Bay Shipping Yacht Company, a shipyard here in Alameda celebrating 21 years this April.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also serve on the board of directors for the Alameda Chamber of Commerce and the working water waterfront cohort. There are a lot of exciting things happening in Alameda these days in the maritime industry. A new job, opportunities for our youth, and a maritime focused program starting this fall at the College of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are very excited with the prospects of Aida coming to Alameda with their maintenance facility, along with the new jobs and millions of dollars that they will invest right here in Alameda. We wholeheartedly support and welcome them here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But most of all, I'd like to say to all of all of you that I'm confident with your leadership abilities that you'll come to a collaborative solution which will be good for all, including the harbor seals. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So please go for the win win. And welcome, Rita, here. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'City Council members and staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Carrie Thompson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am a resident as well as a past president.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of the Chamber of Commerce. And I don't know about you, but I was living here in 1989 in the earthquake. And I really like the idea of having we to here that we would have our own emergency transportation authority here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As any of you who were here then do, remember the challenges that it was to get across the bay to San Francisco or to other points. So I do encourage you to approve this project, this MRU. And I also want to remind you that as a business person and we're adding jobs to the local economy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other thing we're doing is we're we are reducing, hopefully, the traffic congestion that we all are so frustrated at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Going out through the tube, across all the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bridges, and hopefully we can keep those jobs here in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They'll. And Irene Dieter and the Richard Banger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor. Council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I urge your strong support for the wider project. Without further encumbering it, I think I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bring a balanced.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Perspective. I've been a member of at least a dozen environmental organizations. I'm a member of the Nature Conservancy. People that know my background would understand when I say that some of my best friends are or were seals. Seriously, though, I do have a special affinity for marine life in general.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But also found several businesses, one of which was a commercial diving contracting business. I've been involved in shoreline projects like shipping terminals and docks and bridges, etc., from Alaska to New Zealand. And I'm always concerned with trying to minimize negative environmental impacts from these projects and always looking for effective ways to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there are always pros and cons to all of these projects. I think the positives, positive benefits of the wider project far outweigh the negatives and the fact that Rita is willing to spend $100,000 for a new seal hauled out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is more than adequate mitigation for that impact. I urge you to move this project forward and not impose requirements or with further delay it or otherwise further impede its progress. And I just want to end with thanking you all for your service to the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know it's a tough job.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello, Mayor and council members. First of all, I'd like to thank you so much for actually having the contract in place with WADA. Thanks to Vice Mayor Materazzi for leading the charge on that that we have something in writing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's definitely a reassurance. And tonight I'm speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club, who has a few concerns with the EMU that we're hoping that you really look at closely before moving it forward. And mainly there are two clauses in there that kind of contradict each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Section 2.4 says that Waitomo will demolish.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Excuse me. It says that prior to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Demolishing the harbor seal haul out that they will try to build a new one unless way to have not obtained a permit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that means that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The hall out may get demolished before the fields have a new home. To take that into consideration, please. But what contradicts what's puzzling is in the city right to construct number 3.1. It says that if Wadah is unable to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The inability of waited to to commence construction is solely due to the inability to obtain permits. Then the city will take over the project. Well, if wait a can't get the permits, why will the city be able to get the permits?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why would the city ever want to take that? In my misreading that or something, Marilyn saying no, but that's what it looks like. It says solely due to the inability of wader to obtain all permits. Then the city will take it over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So please. Between number 2.4 and 3.1. If you could look at that, it seems like the 3.1 doesn't need to be there in back to the site selection. It says that the parties shall meet and select a location, a mutually agreed location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And tonight, we've heard that the National Marine Fisheries Service will be the guiding light to that. Unfortunately, sometimes our regulatory agencies also missed the boat. They are the ones who said that the SEALs could haul out on the Rocky breakwater, too, which is doesn't make any sense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They did not do their due diligence in their last paperwork, and many wildlife experts know that. So with that, I'm hoping that the site selection, the tiebreaker to that is the city council itself and that the public actually can weigh in on the site location.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Richard Banger and then Rachel Campos and Travis Wilson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Members of the city council and city staff and to the waiter staff that are here tonight. When I first started following this project a good four years ago, I after wasn't long and I started wondering if it was ever going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But here we are. And after a number of years, I started taking an interest in the harbor seals, and I realized that their their presence there wasn't just an anomaly. Turns out they aren't there year round. So if you go there in October, let's say, or even September, you might only find one or two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it became apparent to me that it was a regular hall out site. And in fact, last year there was a harbor seal pup that was born there and we found there. So I'm glad that this memorandum of understanding has been finalized.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could there be some improvements in the language? I suppose so. But I think at this point there's a public perception that. A whole lot will be built that is so strong that. Failing to execute is not an option anymore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it will happen as far as consulting with different agencies. I mean, it's already been pointed out by Mr. McConnell that there's only anecdotal evidence on constructing a fallout for Pearl Harbor SEALs. So I would just caution against studying this to death.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, you know, you could mimic what's already out there, only make it build it to last 30 years, you know, couple of beams and and something that looks more or less like what's out there now and pull it out and anchor it and the SEALs will make their way up onto it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would I would caution against studying it to death as far as where it goes. You're you're pretty well constrained by the traffic, the Marine traffic lanes. And so, I mean, obviously, you're not going to put it out in the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Barry Lane. There's a limited number of places you can put it, and I can I can point to where the limited spaces are that you could put it. And one last thing. I, I don't want to. Be managing this, the staff's discussions with Wadah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do think it would be important if if you gave direction to the city manager to bring back some sort of report in a couple of months so that at least the community felt engaged in the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't have a specific proposal, but I would like to have it brought back at some point in the next couple of months and touch base with the public. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You mean Mayor Spencer and members of the City Council? My name is Rachel Campos de Ivanov, and I am the Alameda resident. I'm also a huge supporter of the ferry, improving our public transportation infrastructure. And I absolutely love that there are going to be some new union jobs that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also really appreciated that you guys on the city council have listened to the public protests and have ensured that there is language that will ensure that we are getting the call out, that we have been jumping up and down and trying to fight for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I completely agree with Irene Dieter and Richard Bangert that there could be some improvements to the language. But I also appreciate that Mr. Mackinaw has, you know, is also listening to the public and is taking action to make sure that those concerns are being heeded.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also would encourage you guys on the city council to please remain vigilant and provide, you know, accountability that this is constructed within Alameda and that the public is brought back into the process because there are some sensitivities around this particular project and feeling as if it has sort of come in under the radar.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we haven't had the opportunity to have our voice heard until it's a little bit too late. So I would please recommend that that the public, as you know, continue to be a part of the process through the planning board meetings as well as, you know, with the building out of this all out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Hi. You might remember I was here a couple of weeks ago in support of this project, and I have changed my mind to. We don't know enough. I know. I know you don't like delays, but that's why we do second readings, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We might change our minds. Let's pretend. Hear me out on this. Let's pretend I have a measure of public sentiment right here. And it says that Alameda in general, we've done the survey. We figured it out. Alameda think that that piece of coastline down to internal high is, in fact, a natural area worth preserving.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's blank, but we'll pretend. And if you have that, you know, if it's true, then as stewards of our city property, you can't really you can't really approve this. Right? That that piece of property is then worth more than the rent and the commerce we're going to get from it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you are you are risking it by leasing it. The whole thing we know, as Sara Ellen will tell you, you you can't just take little pieces out of an ecosystem. You're going to threaten the whole thing. It's fun to talk about a seal haul out and and draft language about it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's something that we can control. We can control that hall out. Right. We have no idea what's going to happen naturally to the nature. I didn't hear any CEOs come here and testify a couple of weeks ago. Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, the fact is, we don't know. So so we can risk that piece of land or not. And the question then, I think really is, does the public think that that piece of coastline is worth preserving? And we don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it bugs me that we don't know. It bugs me that that we don't have a better way to ask the public that direct question. Right. It's not like it's not the same thing to have hearings in San Francisco and count the number of people who don't show up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not the same thing as asking them, do you want to preserve this piece of coastline? And I know that Mr. De Saag, you are so. I feel it. I am also so sensitive. About the number of times you're asked to delay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It happens all the time. This has been going on for a long time and a lot of people have done a lot of work. And I want to know why no one has asked the public this question. I could have been on a ballot by now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to delay until we ask those questions. If not, you're going to guess right. And if you do believe that. People don't value that piece of coastline, then yes, you should leverage that piece of land. And if you believe they do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You have to not do this. And if you don't feel confident in your guess. Please do something tonight that can be reversed later. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bobby Winston and then Terrace Hall. And those are our last two speakers. If you want to speak on this item, please submit your slip.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a mayor. I'm Bobby Winston. I am the owner of Bay Crossings. I have been involved with Wheatus since the very beginning and Alameda resident and I am just delighted that the prospect of this maintenance facility being here in Alameda, it's a boon for the region.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a boon for our community. I think you should know that one of the things that figures to be involved with is a thing called the working waterfront cohort, which has been created with the College of Alameda that seeks to do something about the terrible lack of vocational education.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This project will be an important part of that. I honor the environmental concerns. I sincerely do. But the bottom line is this is a boon for this community, and it should be welcomed with open arms. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Grace Hall and then that choose our last speaker unless there's any more slips. Hey. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor and City Council. And I appreciate all of the work you've done on this project, and I'm really in favor of the project, so please understand that right off the bat, one of my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Concerns is that I am a multi-generational alum.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maiden, and I haven't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Been brought up to speed on this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh, on this project. The first I heard about it was at the end of last year, and then all of a sudden it was located down next to the Hornet. That aside, my concern in reading through the piece is, is that it does seem that you fixed the four stories in the lease agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That seems to me that it's bypassing our our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planning board process. So that was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of my first concerns. And if it's part of the lease agreement and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city does citizens of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda decide we do not want a four story building there? Because if you take a look at the rendering, it appears that most of the other buildings in the vicinity are two and 2 to 3 story. And I wasn't even.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Aware of the continued, you know, our plans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the future of maintaining all of the maritime activity out there. So that was one. I'm concerned about the planning board process and if we don't meet the four story requirement that we'd be in breach of half of the lease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Another thing I noticed in the lease was the hazmat tanks and that the the safety measures around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the fuel tanks. The only stipulation we have is for a double walled tank. Any of the other safety requirements and measures I guess are up to WHITTA and the sole responsibility of the tenant. So that was a concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lastly and of course very, very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Important to me is the whole seal all out. I am a birder and am just so excited about, you know, our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bird sanctuary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And maintaining the beauty of our coastline through Alameda. It's been it's been a big part of my life since I've been very, very young. So I'd just like to know, is there a measure for a metric for measuring the success of this hall out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We keep talking about this new location, but I think someone mentioned it is what is the metric for success here? Is somebody to talk to the SEALs? Are we going to measure it across one season? Is it, you know?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that was a big question. How are we measuring that success?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that was it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you for listening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There being no further comment slips. We'll begin with member comments. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'May I? Thank you, Mary Spencer. Thank you to everybody who stayed to help inform this discussion. As I sit in, listened to all the comments, first of all, I do think this has been a very collaborative process. And you can see that the council and the staff listened to suggestions about the SEAL fall out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And kudos to Ida for coming up with an MRU that addresses that, not only in my view, but hundred thousand dollars for that effort. What I'm trying to look at is the big picture taking into consideration all of the efforts to bring funding into our city for this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's something that we as a council struggle with all the time. Our budget we're going to be you'll see in the next couple of minutes we're going to be doing budget hearings. There's never enough money for all that we want to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For years, we've struggled with the former Naval Air Station, closed in 1996. It's 2015. We have some very robust leases, thanks in large part to Mr. and Mrs. Marcano, who helped measure help manage those efforts. But we really should be excited about the efforts to bring funding, federal and state funding to our island for this project that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'is serving water transit. We are an island. We say that all the time. We're an island. One of the ways that we'll get people on and off the island and not make them go through the tube over a bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm an island to an already crowded freeway is by water transit. And we want to we need to support that. It's how a growing community that is an island we're reminded of that all the time is going to grow both in an environmentally and community friendly way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then there's the added benefit of the emergency operations center, the water based emergency operations center that will service in the event that our roadways, bridges, the tube are somehow impacted or impaired in an event like an earthquake and creating maritime jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, it is a struggle. We never I think we never win this struggle of trying to keep our public informed of all that is going on. But ever since we began talking about the redevelopment of the Naval Air Station, we have talked about preserving its maritime character.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We and only a number of other communities, I mean, Oakland and Richmond certainly and in parts of San Francisco have a working waterfront and bay shipyard. I don't know if people really understand if you know, we're the main street ferry terminal is you see their big structure but I went to the opening ceremony when they they introduced'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this working waterfront cohort in conjunction in partnership with the College of Alameda. But let me tell you a little bit more about the people who are going to be getting jobs as a result of this program. These are the formerly homeless near and dear to my heart.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of you know, I'm a former probation officer are people who've had a criminal past. But, you know, they're they're out now, but they're looking for a job. As the district attorney of Alameda, Nancy O'Malley, district attorney of Alameda County, happens to be an Alameda resident.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'She was at that ceremony because she is one who knows that if you don't find people who are down on their luck, who've had brushes with the law jobs or the the formerly homeless are on the verge of being homeless jobs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're going to get into trouble. They're going to burden the system in so many other ways. But right here in Alameda, in partnership with Bay Shipyard in the College of Alameda, we are doing something about it. We should all be proud of that effort.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm as concerned about the environment as the next person, and I do appreciate that we have the birders and the SEAL watchers and all of you, and I wish I had more time to be out there, but but I will get out and see them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But bear in mind that one of the things this project is helping pay for is the continuation and the realignment of the Bay Trail around that area and a park. So we'll get people out in a much nicer environment to get out and watch and just recreate in in a park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that we as a council always need to take into consideration all the different competing efforts, interests and weigh the balance and come out with the best possible project. And I, I think that we've worked long and hard on this one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm very excited to see this facility come to Alameda. And I appreciate staff and we time in coming to what I think are two excellent agreements that I'm prepared to support. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member comments? Member, Brody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go for it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I'll try to be brief. So. Just the takeaways for me on this. This is an exciting project that kind of helps us take advantage of our situation as an island. We can. Also respect our heritage as a maritime center with having a maritime industry here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what the properties designated for commercial maritime use. It's perfect use of the property. I'm excited about the jobs. The project labor agreement is also very important to me and I do want to thank Richard and Irene for I know last week, you know, I did the balancing test and I came out with a different balancing test'",
        "'speaker_7': 'than you did. But I want to thank you for your perseverance on this and making sure that we we have an agreement, we have a written agreement, and we don't have to trust somebody's word. And I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm glad that we found a way that we can have a win win.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Minute. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I think the MCU is good because it puts what was a verbal agreement in writing. It also provides both staff of Weeden and Alameda with the guidelines to go forward. And I owe your attention to 4.1, which talks about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Time is of the essence for the lease. And I think Mr. Mercado hit the nail on the head that time is of the essence in selecting the site, and I would like to have that reported back to the council and not take a couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Use every effort to bring it forward with consultation with the biologists as soon as possible and then as far as the list goes on. It is a judgment of this council based on all as a representative body, based on all the interests that we have for preserving the community and the ecosystem with our best efforts on the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'float. But we're also bringing jobs to me to point, which is a key priority for me. I think it's a key priority for the city, its first $50 million project, which most of that is a cost of building it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most of that is labor that goes into it. It pays people jobs, pays people who are working two jobs that allow them to live in the Bay Area. 10,100 new jobs, $2 million worth of infrastructure, housing, parkland, a new water main and Bay Trail realignment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm properly prepared to support both going forward tonight. Again, with time is of the essence as far as getting the provisions of the memo you met.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyday.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you very much to the members of the public who came out not just tonight but two weeks ago on this matter. This is an important matter, given the magnitude of the jobs and the, uh, just the way that it's positioning Alameda in terms of the regional transit network.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's also important in terms of how we move forward with Alameda Point, not just in terms of affecting the built environment, but also making sure to treat the natural environment correctly. And that natural environment does include wildlife, not just on the old runway, but also in the waters in and around Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we understand the magnitude of this project. Because as a council, you know, we deal with a lot of issues that come before us, not just here in Alameda Point, but throughout the city. And as each and every issue comes before us, city council in conjunction with staff and in conjunction with all the previous commissions and boards'",
        "'speaker_5': '. What we are tasked to do, among other things, is to evaluate what threats and risks arise when projects come as well as, you know, what are the opportunities. We have to evaluate the threats and risks thoroughly. And we also have to come up with the right and the best mitigations to threats to the environment if and as'",
        "'speaker_5': 'they arise. So the question then is, has the city council and has the process leading up to tonight as each of the members exercised basically the term of due diligence? And is there a framework in place, i.e., the lease agreement, as well as a memorandum of agreement, to move forward and to embrace the opportunities that arise, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'also protect us against threats and risks should they arise. I think the city staff has put together a proposal that all of us in Alameda should embrace. It is something that moves us forward, not just economically but also environmentally.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just want to make sure, to reiterate one point that I said last at the last meeting. What I said then was that, you know, this is a city staff and this is a city council that's willing to listen and modify accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we work well together at within. On this day as as well as we work well with the community, we're not here to just shove things down the throats of people. You know, we're here to get the work of the public done to move us forward as a community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not just having blinders that just look at jobs and and our economy, as important as that is. But also, we look at the natural environment, do what we can to protect it. So as I indicated as well at the last meeting, okay, if we need to improve how we're going to deal with the harbor seals, then then'",
        "'speaker_5': 'let us do so. And we've done that. And it's important for me to mention this because I got to say, I mean, we three of us on council here. Council member Odie. Council member as he Ashcraft and myself.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, we get really castigated in the press. I mean, the way in which we got castigated in the press, basically calling us people who don't care about the harbor seals. It was incredible. I've never seen something like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've been on the council for a long time. I got to tell you, I've. The way in which we are castigate in the press. It was very, very. Not very happy. But, you know, there are times when, you know, you get good news in the press.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, as council members, you know, you have to balance it. But you've got to understand, members here in the public as well as those watching in the in the in the through the Internet or on television.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, this is a council and this is a staff that's doing its level best. And we're always open to modifying things, but we're going to move forward. And, you know, if there are questions that people think that there are unknowns, I think that that's a valid question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think that question has to be balanced against, well, was there a framework in place that treat unknowns right now as well as treat whatever might happen down the down the path? And I think we do have a framework in place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I've read the lease statement, I've read the environmental sections, which is section 12 of the lease. You know what? Can't can unfortunate things happen like in the oil spill. It could happen. Unfortunately, we live in a life where there are threats and risks and threats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the question is, as a council, have we done our due diligence to be able to deal with those as they arise? I mean, think about it. We're building a new gas station right outside of the Webster Tube coming into town.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, this is I mean, think about what that means. Think about that. Even setting aside the fact that we're building a gas station, that we have gas stations in town, all cities. Of risks and threats. The question is not simply do we do nothing because there are risks and threats.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The question, the real question, I think is are we putting in place the right processes to deal with those as they are as they arise? But at the same time, embracing what opportunities there are with regard to improving our environment or improving.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our our economy. And I think we struck that balance. I want to thank, you know, wheater for making the investment in in the city of Alameda. I want to thank the representatives from Richmond for taking the time to coming out here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But know that we had a facility will be built in Alameda. And I want to end it by this way. I really thought that what Leslie Cameron, owner of Bay Shipping Yard, said was not only great, but I think that alliteration was great when she said win, win and welcome Wieder.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Indeed, I think that's what tonight is about. Win, win and welcoming Guido.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I, i to appreciate the project and the work that's been done to date. However, when I heard at the beginning of this meeting that this issue, that the last public meeting prior to the last council meeting was way back in November 2010.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was the planning board meeting that there have been no meetings actually reaching out to our community, showing them what we're talking about. We have a project going on right now, a site A, and Joe Ernst has been going around this community with drawings, reaching out multiple places.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We haven't had that here. And I agree with the speaker in regards to. Our ecosystem there, the natural area that we haven't heard really from the community. And I appreciate that we have had representations or speakers on behalf of the unions and we leader coming out here and encouraging.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the jobs. But I my concern is that we haven't done our due diligence in regards to reaching out to Alamitos when meetings take place in San Francisco held by WETA. They're not advertised here. I personally am very active in our community, as I know many of our speakers that came tonight who honestly did not know and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do not know very much about this. And they have questions and I think they have a right to have their questions answered prior to the approval. That doesn't mean that it would have to. It would it would create a delay for the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't mean that after by giving the community an opportunity to weigh in on a project and have meaningful discussions with our community, it doesn't mean that we'd end up necessarily at a different place. It means that our community has an opportunity to hear answers to their questions and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a speaker that brought up that the site would be better for a park, that they would have preferred this to go to the estuary. I think the public has a right to know why. Why that location?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In regards to the MRU for the SEALs, I have concerns in regards to the location. I'm not sure that it is as simple as just being suggested that you can just build another hall out and the seals will go there, that they'll return.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also don't know. I think the SEALs are actually the surface of the ecosystem there. And when we have 12 ferries coming in every evening, making noise, being refueled, leaving in the morning, what impact does that have on the habitat?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And not just the SEALs, but everything else that's there. I don't think that's been addressed. And we did have a speaker at the prior council meeting speak to protecting concerns about the campground. She had thought about that. We would have that campground as an option in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we may have the campground, but it's going to have. 12 ferries coming in every evening and leaving in the morning and who knows what else. Damage to the ecosystem and and and I don't think it's appropriate to have one standard for Joe Ernst to to go around and communicate with the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And a completely different standard as in the last prior meeting was November 2010. Here we are or a year later. Being asked to approve a project with no other meetings with our community. I think it's a serious problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that we can do better and unfortunately we have. This is city land, by the way. We have very little city land. When a private developer owns land. We we have less input on what will happen there than when it's Alameda land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is Alameda Ann's land. This is not council's land. This is not Wieters land. They don't own the land. This is the city of Alameda, this land. And that to me is a serious difference. Then I think it's even more incumbent upon council and staff to engage the community in this decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the other issues that were raised in regards to the fuel tanks, the height of the building, the success of the sale out of the hall, out, how will that all be measured? I think those are all questions that the public deserves answers to before the lease is approved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'After that, it will be too late, as it was already explained to us earlier. Thank you. We have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will move. Man City Council. We need to do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we should do them separately. And you should do the M.O.. You first. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. So I will move that council, authorize the city manager to execute a memorandum of understanding between the city of Alameda and the Water Emergency Transportation Authority regarding the construction of a replacement seal haul out at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As well. You had your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I have a friendly amendment, if you would consider it that. A staff brings through the city manager a report on the status of site location. In in a timely fashion so that we have a ability to track the progress.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if it gets out of hand, we know sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would actually say that I don't think that that needs to be an amendment to the memorandum of understanding is in that direction that we give to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is where.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also give staff direction. Okay. That we can do that. Okay. And that we in addition to authorizing city manager to execute the reference memorandum of understanding, we also give staff direction as to what he said.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Report out. May I ask what the maker of the motion. We don't have any.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm the maker of the machine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. Then the amendment person who made the initial proposal regarding time the proposed amendment. Like to be sure that staff has clear direction on a monthly basis. On a monthly basis. I would ask that you not do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would ask that you look more at a bi monthly basis. We already have monthly reports on side. We have the budget coming up. The staff is overwhelmed right now with the reports and we just agree to come every two months with this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I actually think there was a speaker who suggested that very thing every two months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So would you? Well, we only have so many people on staff. Understood. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know our brilliant city clerk got that all down. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Another comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Russians point. All those in favor. I oppose. I oppose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor. Oh, you know, I'll make a motion that we accept the recommendation and direct the city manager to execute the lease.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the Council. Tonight we are kind of kicking off the beginning of our two year fiscal 15, 16 and 1617 budget cycle. We won't have any numbers tonight, but I am going to be going over the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you know, this is a very important time of year for us as we look back to see how we've done over the past year and then also to project into the future to see what kind of services that we think we can afford to provide to the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just as by way of background, I'd like to remind you that the budget is a planning document. It's a work in progress. And as we move through the fiscal year, we make adjustments along the way for things that we don't anticipate, including both on the revenue side and the expenditure side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Tonight, I'd like to go over the schedule with you and then discuss in very general terms some of the assumptions that we're making as we put together the budget. So far, the city manager's office has met with all the departments to set the stage for the development of their individual budgets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To date, the departments have returned their initial requests for the upcoming two years. At the same time, the Finance Department has been reviewing not only our historical revenues, but our anticipated revenues based on research of what's going on in the region as well as locally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of our discussion that will that we'll have going forward will be focused on the general fund, which is, as most of you know, is about 71 million, roughly 71 to 75 million. But as some of you also know, our total budget is closer to 190 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we typically focus on the general fund because that is our discretionary funding and provides core services like public safety. But I just want to be clear that really the general fund is about 37% of all the funds that the city has uses and needs to conduct its business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's just kind of a kind of a reminder. So I'd like to move to our schedule. As you see, we've we've got two, four.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Six.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dates that we've already pulled and scheduled meetings, two of which actually three of which are regular meetings, three of which are special meetings. The first meeting, obviously, tonight, which is we'd like to just review the schedule, make sure it's okay with you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, I'll talk a little bit about our revenue and expenditure assumptions very briefly. Our next meeting is Tuesday, April 7th. At that time, we are we are intending to introduce the preliminary budget. However, we have that that that schedule may slide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you know, we have some transitions within the organization, in the finance department, as well as the departments have been fielding quite a few requests for information analysis. So we're a little bit behind schedule, but we are going to try and meet that date.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At a minimum, we'll be presenting you our revenues, if not the expenditures. We'll also be talking about this is on April 7th, which is the regular council meeting. Discussion of OPEB and PERS as well as our deferred maintenance and infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those three items. In fact, we do that every year or every two years when we do this budget. But this was something obviously that was highlighted by Treasurer Kevin Kennedy. And we want to make sure that that that the council, as well as the community, is aware of those issues in the beginning of the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the last two bullet items, the one time revenues advances, loans and transfers and our reserves. This is in deference to the vice mayor's request, I believe, a couple of meetings ago. And we're just going to go through we'll go through that and talk talk a little bit more in depth about how we treat those in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the budget process. Then the next three meetings are special meetings, and those meetings are they were really designed to meet the request of the mayor, which was to essentially kind of have an open house so the departments would explain what they do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in we've also asked them at that time to explain any major changes in their budget, any initiatives that they might have, and then also to look at how they did compared to last year. And as you'll see, we've tried to limit these presentations and the meetings to no more than 3 hours.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have kind of we've we've we've bundled large departments with smaller departments. So it's not so heavy on every on every meeting. So we have a meeting on Wednesday, April 29th, Tuesday, May 12th. And then, um. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. April 16th is the start of the special meeting. April 29th is the second one. And then Tuesday, May 12th is the third special meeting for the departments. And then hopefully, depending on when we when we introduce our preliminary budget, we will be looking to adopt the budget on June 2nd, and that is generally the schedule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'd like to move to sort of some general general discussions about our assumptions, and I'll start off with our expenditures. This is generally kind of the guidance that we give to the departments when they're putting together their budgets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the first thing that we said to them was no increases to contractual services. This is like the hiring of of of consultants and so forth. So we just said, if you have the need, that's fine, but don't put any escalator clauses in any of your contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the idea here is that we're asking folks to hold the line, to negotiate their contracts. We feel like this is an area that our department heads do have some discretion on and they can negotiate with their vendors and hold the line.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we said no increases to contractual services. There are some exceptions, for example, utilities with that's not within the control of the departments, the utility. We cannot negotiate the cost of our utilities. So those those types of services, we've said that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, if you're going to have increases there and we already know that we're going to have some increases. We said limiting staff increases. In fact, we said pretty much we said no staff increases unless you can justify why you need additional staffing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can tell you, for example, we are planning on adding or there's going to be a request to add some folks in the information technology sector of our departments because we have learned that they are woefully understaffed and our infrastructure is woefully inadequate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Labor. So the cost of labor that is not at all within the discretion of the departments because they're completely covered by labor agreements. And so we actually input that the finance department actually inputs that information for the departments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have no discretion. But we do know, for example, the purse rates are going to go up. Safety will go up 5% in the next two years. Miscellaneous will go up 3%. Same thing with wage increases that's outlined in the in the memo use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those increases range from zero, which are set to somewhere between two and 5%. It depends on which bargaining unit you're in. And then health premiums there, we're factoring in an increase about between three and 4%. So that kind of takes care of labor and and are essentially our overarching assumptions for expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And on the revenue side. So this is a little bit more of an art. Kind of anticipating what our revenues are going to be this year. We recognize that our finance department was in transition. And so we we contracted with Beacon Economics to help us do our forecasting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've used them in the past. Our previous finance director did not use them, but we decided this year might be a good, good time to use them again. I don't know if you're familiar with Beacon Economics, but they're an economics research firm that does essentially forecasting into the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They look at their their specialty is essentially San Francisco East Bay, South Bay. They also do Los Angeles, and they also do forecasting for the state comptroller. They're a very well-respected organization. Their forecasting has been what I've seen so far, a little aggressive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we're going to make sure that that is tailored to to to Alameda and make sure and we have provided local information. So hopefully we'll we'll find that strike that balance. Departmental revenues, those are things like police citations, building and plan, check, engineering, fire inspections, those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And most of those revenues have escalators already built into them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to interrupt real quick. We're about to hit 1030. And so we need to have a motion to consider the remaining items, six F and nine A, and that requires four votes to approve. We have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have a second?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion passes unanimously. Thank you. You may continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I'm almost done, actually. We also on the revenue side, just some things that we do know. For example, with the dissolution of redevelopment we have now, I think I can't remember how many years it's been, but it's now been several years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're starting to see some trends about how much the general fund is actually reaping from unfortunately the dissolution of of redevelopment. And it looks like we're going to over the next at least 3 to 4 years, the general fund will receive about $1,000,000 that it hadn't received in the past on a consistent basis, which is a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good thing. No, that's our former property to the former tax increment revenue. So it still has to go through what they're calling, you know, the waterfall, all the taxing entities. But the term that they're now using, Miss Potter has informed me, is called boomerang funds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we can now expect roughly around, give or take, about $1,000,000 annually as a result of the the boomerang funds. Not good news for economic development efforts, but it is good news for the general fund. And that actually was sort of the idea behind one of the reasons why Governor Brown eliminated redevelopment in the first place and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'then one time funds, I think we'll talk a little bit more about this next time. But we look at the source of those one time funds. And if we think there are spikes in revenue, we look back at that and then we'll take them out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For example, we know last year we had several one time transactions that spiked our transfer tax. That was property that was transferred out of Alameda Landing and VF outdoors also had some some transactions and so we'll back that out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know that that's one time there are big spikes. We'll take that out of our revenue forecast. And then the other the flip side to that is if we know something's coming, for example, if we know we're going to get a spike in revenue for something, guess I can't think of anything off the top of my head'",
        "'speaker_3': ', but if we know for a fact, it's coming. We sort of have an obligation to put that in. That is considered a revenue. So that does go into our budgeted revenues. But again, if it's something that happened in the past that we can't anticipate happening in the future, then we would would we'd back that out?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that actually concludes what I have to offer for you tonight. I thought maybe we could take a look a look back at the schedule. And if you had any questions or if you wanted any revisions, we'd be happy to discuss that with you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Amber Ashcraft thank you good presentation is former dam the. Only concern that I have is. When that came up in closed session today that we're wanting to, I think I can say.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right, discuss OPEB, OPEB.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And PERS and devote a meeting, a council meeting to that. And so this is a really ambitious schedule. And I'm just wondering. Do we really need an hour for some of these open house kinds of presentations? I just it's always a toss up between every time we convene a meeting, which means we get staff together and the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'public I mean, this is a lot of meetings for members of the public to come out to. If they want to come in person, they don't have to come in person. But does anyone see any way that we could maybe consolidate some of this and still manage to get to the real meat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of our.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Budget deliberations and. Anyway. That's. That's. This concerns me and I know this city. The city clerk does a masterful job of herding cats by getting us out, pulling us. And by the way, these are just budget hearings, folks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These aren't even the transportation planning workshops and other things. This is not the city council's calendars. So any brilliant ideas about how we might manage this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, de sa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I think there seems to be agreement that the unfunded liabilities OPEB pers certainly and perhaps deferred, but especially OPEB. Warrants. Kind of one workshop devoted to that. As I look at the April 7th meeting, it's altogether possible that the bullet point on March 17th of today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No word.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, well, no. I just want to say that I do think that the issue of open purrs certainly warrants a workshop devoted to these unfunded liabilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to see us just direct staff to squeeze it into this. The meetings that are set because we do have a meeting. As a council member, Ashcraft mentioned on transportation, that's not on the schedule. And there are also regular city council points.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my suggestion is we put it back. We have the other post-employment benefit and the PERS. The Public Employees Retirement System Workshop is a priority in my opinion, and the show and tell and description of what people do in their departments contributes to the time for that first priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What are you proposing then? I would you like or not like I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I propose that we adopt the schedule as written. However. The other post-employment benefit and the public employees retirement system. A move to one of the special meetings. As a priority and the time needed for that is removed from the from the descriptions of what departments do in the other meetings that we have time for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I recall this one, madam. Did you tell us that we. April 7th might be a little early to bring those two back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, it's actually really the preliminary budget. So, I mean, what we could do. Alternatively, if the vice mayor was amenable, is that we could just have the discussion on April 7th on OPEB and person and we could SLI the preliminary budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Although my objection to that is April 7th is the regular council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's going to be other other agenda items that we have to go through. And that's why I think it's a special meeting. It's the first up at the special occasion and then we manage the rest of the meetings that are scheduled or you manage the rest of the schedule to get get the departments in front of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'us. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. We can ask them to to limit it. Limit the amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, perhaps if. Yeah. I think I'd be fine with the meeting. I don't like all these extra meetings, but I think we have to do them. Just say that out front. If we had a. Special meeting on the OPEB powers and deferred maintenance in addition to the ones on this schedule, or perhaps starting the April 16th'",
        "'speaker_7': 'meeting half hour earlier. I don't know how long that conversation may take, you know, an hour or an hour and a half, you know, if with an hour. You think at it. There's a 50 minute presentation, ten speakers at 3 minutes, that's another half hour.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're at 45 minutes. And then we haven't even spoken. So. I think. It's going to go by a lot faster than we think and we think it's going.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that raises a good question. But does the start time proposed start time for the special meetings? If we restart.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Uh, 630. 630. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we could start at six or that be too early. I'd prefer starting at six if possible, because I think that then. Then we'd have a better chance of including the public if. If possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think sometimes we also get a special closed session thrown in. And I think the city manager was about to say something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I just I understand. And it's funny to be on the side of arguing for more meetings when I'm usually saying, okay, we only have so much staff. I don't know whether or not it can be done, but I really I feel very strongly that to decant all of the issues, given the complexities of OPEB.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would just really urge the Council to reconsider and do a special meeting for OPEB. It's such a huge number. It's it's a nine figure problem. I think it merits its own meeting because it's so complicated. And in order to explain it in such a way, to have the public understand what is being considered.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's worth a separate meeting. I understand very well that it's a lot of meetings and I understand very well that it puts a burden on the council. And it's hard for me to believe I'm arguing this side of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think. I just would ask the council to reconsider and think about doing a special meeting at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I, I, I agree that OPEB could have its own special meeting, and I think it would be advantageous to give counsel and the public lots of times for question and answer. I'm wondering if we could take the set number of meetings and just consolidate some of what the vice mayor referred to as the show and tell'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the open house ones into. Into one. I'm just, you know, I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or two. Well, yeah, but I'm just saying, we've got how many different we've got. One, two, three special meetings just for these departmental open house show and tells if we could move them into two special meetings and then take one of those slots, whichever staff thinks is most logical and assign it OPEB and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that might. And then it never hurts to have a, you know, sort of an open agenda because you know how things come up and get added. That would be my suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But. I mean, what I would suggest since you have a discussion. Look, since discussion of OPEB. And to understand the direction that staff has been moving and that we will, at direction of counsel, continue to move forward after tonight's discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The discussion of OPEB requires a context. Some of that's already set forth here for the meeting of the seven. The only issue with the meeting of the seventh is that it's a regular council meeting. However, if we were to introduce the preliminary budget on the 16.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Discuss one time revenues, advances, loans and transfers on the 16. And general fund reserves on the 16. And just highlight and expand that one discussion discussion of OPEB hers. Input, deferred infrastructure and maintenance to the well. If we could do that, I think that would be very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And given where the staff is on the budget, I don't think leaving the preliminary budget introduction to the 60 is going to kill us. We actually probably would like that. So if we can make the meeting to just put an set aside and understand that an open discussion will take at least 2 hours on the night of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the seventh and put it in as a regular agenda item. I think that would work for staff and keep the ball rolling for action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everyday suck.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Either way, I think that's important. Whether it's on a special meeting basis or on a regular meeting basis. I think the key issue is giving it the time that that OPEB warrants, given the magnitude of the issue at hand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, just to be clear, though, when we say OPEB, I'm assuming that we're also going to discuss PERS and let me say it, because it would be odd if a member of the public came on one night to talk about OPEB and then comes to another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So from the public's point of view, it's PERS, but it's really OPEB right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's and that's and that's what I was suggesting is we just we just what is now currently listed for April the seventh. We take it all out except the discussion of OPEB and PERS and similar to the contextual discussion that counsel earlier that see as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I. I'm concerned about the agenda item. I mean, the placement on the agenda. I would like it to be early. When it comes the OPEB, but it's one. The budget discussions are part of the regular council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's important to have those items at the beginning of the calendar. I agree. It's possible and we're fresher. I'm ready to do. You have another comment? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I just wanted to hear your thoughts as the person who runs the meeting on and the city manager. Because I, I think your idea of starting at six for some of these special meetings, at least maybe on the first one or the second one, so we could see how long they take them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And maybe they won't take that long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I would I would I would like to see 6 a.m., a six day, 6 a.m. strike. That strike that 6 p.m. starts on the special meetings. We would not normally have any closed session before on a special meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just anticipate that for this. So I don't know if council is agreeable to 6 p.m. start on the special meetings and then on the regular meetings. I'd like to have the discussions on the budget be at the beginning of the agenda so that we address the earlier rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I just have a question also. So if someone wants to come and discuss either, for instance, increasing a budget for a department that has previously been cut or for whatever reason they want to increase it, do they come when each department is being discussed?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then if overall of where? But they have an opportunity towards the end then or where they look at the overall budget and make changes in regards to priorities, things that they think more money should be spent on, things that they think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So in the presentations, the departmental presentations, they'll discuss, you know, I call them initiatives, but it's any changes from previous years. So if they're asking for more staff or whatever, they'll be presenting it at that time. And then when we do the, the, the budget, so part of it will be the preliminary budget will be the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'introduction. So we'll give you sort of a broad overview of what the budget is looking like and all the major categories. Then the departments will go through their information and then you'll see the whole thing put together on the on June 2nd.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And over the years, there have been cuts to some departments or ours, for instance, library our public hours. Will that be shared as part of each department's presentation of where there have been cuts in the past? Or would it be up to the public just to remember?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I personally would like to have that included. I think that there were some cuts and that so we could have a comprehensive discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, if that's if the council feels that that's a you know, you'd like them to do that, we can directed departments to include that into their, in their, in their presentations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Member Ashraf Well I was going to say, I mean I think that it, it comes up when we're, I guess we could both be asking library staff for example, just using that as an example. And then when we're voting to approve budget items, we have that discussion again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course always understanding that it's, you know, you give and you take. So if ours were, say, increased, maybe staff would have to be cut or the budget for purchasing materials would have to be cut. But we have very competent department heads and they know their departments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, I think we've all learned a lot from listening to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know what other member Ody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In not going through this budget process before and knowing at the top of my head what was cut in the past. I mean, I think the trends of the last budget in the budget before I think would would be helpful for for some of us that haven't gone through this before, at least at least from my perspective'",
        "'speaker_0': '. It would be helpful to me. I'm also a new member here. Is counsel agreeable to knowing what's happened in the past? Bring us up to speed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And take that much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also the public, for that matter. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then so when the if if there are community members that want to discuss shifting funds, where would that take place?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, that can happen at any time. But that would most likely because you'll have all the information on the second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On June 2nd. Mm hmm. Okay, so then. And that's at a regular meeting? Mm hmm. So, can we include enough time on the agenda, then? Have not just a presentation that this is what we're being asked to approve, but actual to allow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Commonly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other comments on this item?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Make a motion. I move that we follow the. Proposal of the city manager to. Of the other post-employment benefits in the first discussion on the meeting of the April 7th and the for the other items listed in the staff report special April 16th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to also consider a start time of six M or the special meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd like I'd like to add. To have it early. The agenda items on the regular.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, the mayor's request to have the budget items on the regular and the regular council meetings early in the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So we have a second. Any discussion. All those in favor I passes unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. Thank you, Councilman.'"

    "Recruitment Process for a New City Manager.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Staff. Right. So now we're on six F.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to direct staff to establish a process for recruitment of a new manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, mayor and council members. I'm Stephanie Geller, Brant Sierra, your administrative services director. I'm here today to discuss with you the process and timeline for selecting a new city manager. And staff is seeking some direction on how to move forward at this point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe you've seen the report that talks about the general timeline that we're looking at. And I think the some of the major questions that we need to. Some guidance on at this point is the where we go forward in terms of the recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have two avenues which to choose. One is to do an internal recruitment. The second is to go outside with a recruitment firm. In my experience, when you're hiring someone at the level of a city manager, it is typical to use an outside recruitment firm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are the folks who are out there with their fingers on the pulse of who's who's available in the city manager, land and city staff. Really, we don't have that information. They will also put out the full color brochures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They know what the trends are and this is what staff is actually recommending at this point. I'm here for any questions on the report or the timeline.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Member Daisuke. The question I have and I sent it earlier to the city manager because I seen it recently, one city they've put out to bid the the service to define city managers. For example, in your staff report, you've identified a whole number of potential human resources agencies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think in the past, I think we just kind of selected one I can't remember generally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we've done both internally and we have selected firms based on you know, I called around to find out basically what they're charging and who's available. And one thing I have found is that some firms are very busy right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so it's going to be depending on who's available and who people, you know, say that they, you know, are available to do a city manager recruitment, the city of Alameda, because that's a big recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So let me just the question I have is and I'm not locked into any position, it's just a question that I want to make sure to put out there. You know, what thoughts have you given to putting out to bid?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Who who we select.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, in terms of bidding process, and it's a good question, this isn't the kind of thing that normally goes out to bid. Number one, the cost level is quite low. We don't usually put out things to bid until unless they're at a higher price point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is also a type of professional service where the cost is, is they're all pretty much charging the same. It's really a matter of who we like the most. And because it's a matter of quality, we can do that without going out to bid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can simply just call people and find out who's available, who's good, who I like, who puts out, you know, good brochures, who I know does the job. Because we've all been out there and we've been recruited personally and we know who who's the kind of what firms will send out those letters to all those aspiring city'",
        "'speaker_3': 'managers or experienced city managers. So it's actually easier for us to simply do that legwork without going through a formal bidding process. A formal bidding process would also extend the timeline for another probably two months. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are no speaker soaps. Correct. Member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ashcroft Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your report. And I agree with staff that this is a major recruitment for our city. We are facing some very big decisions and projects right now. I also happen to know that H.R. is up to their ears in H.R. work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think and I know just from talking to colleagues in other jurisdictions that there are a number of very good search firms out there to choose from. And I think that this will and of course, if we go this route, the private search firm is going to work with our H.R. department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we certainly tailor the kinds of communications that are sent out. But I know that these firms have, for instance, very extensive databases and and contacts, and they can cast their net wider than I think we would be able to do from here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I am very pleased that we've selected a very competent interim city manager for the time being, but it's still one of our major tasks that this council needs to take on and soon. So I would follow staff's recommendation there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any other member comments?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Brody I have a slightly different take on it. I guess. Councilmember Ashcraft is correct this is probably the most important decision will make and. I don't want us to rush into this. And I still believe, like a lot of people here, we are a unique city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, we have our unique challenges with the base conversion and with our position as an island and traffic and egress and. And such. And. I guess my worry is that, you know, we're going to get a cookie cutter city manager because that's kind of what the search terms go out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we didn't get a cookie cutter last time. And we were blessed that we we had him for the time that that he was here. Wish it was longer, but it is what it is. So, I mean, I'm wondering.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is it? I like the idea of interviewing the potential search firms and kind of talking to them and seeing how they'll understand Almeida's culture and, you know, our specific issues. And because I don't really want to have a cookie cutter search for this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And even if it's two months and we get the budget and all this going on, but, you know, this this is our mark on the city. You know, all all of us. Well, it's going to be our. Our city manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, let me speak to that just a little. Once a for us, if we select a search firm and I'm if our department so recommends a firm, what would happen? The next step in the process is that they would go and then come to you and get guidance on what you are looking for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they would actually have a process in open session where you would talk about your candidate profile, what you're looking for. And that's what they do. They are in the business of doing that, communicating with the governing body and with staff to find out exactly what you need.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't if they.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Were just going to get a cookie cutter city manager, I don't think they'd be in business long because their job is to heed to the wishes of the folks who hire them. So I think that that's going to be taken care of in the process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you go out to like a bid process, frankly, that's not normally done. And I'm not sure who would respond. I'm not sure that you would actually get people responding to it and then coming for a question and answer session.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then because of the nature of the public process, you would actually have to do the interviews in public. That would be an interesting procedure. I've never seen that done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me ask a question. When we hired the finance director, did we use a search firm?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did we?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Yes, we did. Yes, we did. We did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what about the assistant city managers? We did not. City managers. Is there anything that would prevent you as the head of h.r. In dealing with a search firm would do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I explained before, I think the major challenge that we would have as an h.r. Department is in the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Outreach and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the database. I don't have a database of city managers. I can't pick up the phone and ask people if they're interested in coming to work for the city of alameda. We do civil service processes. We do a whole different type of recruitment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When you're talking about executive recruitment. You're calling on a firm that have these people on the line. They've been talking them for years, and usually they know exactly who's looking. They know exactly the kind of person who would want to come into a city of Alameda and they're going to use their networking capabilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, when there's an opening, you know, I'll get calls or letters and because they'll know who to target.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I can't do that. And we really want that capability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Four days ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What thought have you? Let me say two things. The first thing is, you know, the question that council member Jim Odey raised was a great question. But by the same token, I thought the response by city staff person was a great response as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there was a great. Perry interesting there. I wanted to note that. The second point I want to raise is. So what thoughts have you given the you the the search firm working with a committee not of council members but of should we so decide community members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that is that would that happen within the framework of the decision?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolute. Well, not in this decision. What typically happens is in the process of selecting a city manager first, you know, they'll go out, they'll beat the bushes, they'll get all the letters of interest and the resumes and all that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they'll come forth with it with a big pile of folks, and then they'll do an initial screening to really figure out who are the most qualified candidates with the the candidates who are the most qualified. Then you're going to be able to pick panels and do panel interviews.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And those are your community members, your executive management, and you can pick whatever panels you want to really screen these folks into to going forward in the process and sifting out exactly who you want. But what a search firm will do is they'll put out the pretty brochure after getting guidance from you and what you're really looking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for. And then they're going to beat the bushes and they're going to get, you know, 150 applications probably. And then they're going to go through them and they're going to, you know, they're going to vet them. And we really rely on these kind of that kind of professional vetting and they'll, you know, make the phone calls.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry to interrupt. Sorry. At 11 p.m.. Okay. We have a motion to continue past 11.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I moved to you. Them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of them favor. I passes unanimously. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just continue. And then once he gets into the panel interview stage, that's when staff really helps the firm quite a bit because we're going to help put together those panels and we're going to be scheduling them and then we're going to get all this public input and then it gets really sifted down into who you really'",
        "'speaker_3': ', really are looking at based on the scores. And this is just a matter of like a winnowing that that big pool into a smaller pool. And for the initial stages, that's what an executive search firm is so good at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to speak real quick. I agree with member Otis comments in regards to how important this is as a council that that we know how important a decision it is. And my most recent experience on the school board was when, when our prior superintendent was brought in, it was, we used to search firm, but most'",
        "'speaker_0': 'recently we we did it internally. And I personally like the internal process and then then council really does own it. But we but my experience has been you work with H.R. to craft what you're looking for specifically. But then nowadays with social media, it gets out there and and times have changed, I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it allows, you know, anyone that is interested to respond when it's posted publicly like that. And then it comes. And what we did on the school board is we set minimum requirements. And if every candidate that met the minimum requirements that we as a board decided that we got to read the the resumes, cover letters and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'decide who we wanted to then interview, as opposed to leaving it to a search firm to narrow it down for us. And personally. I agree. It is one of the most important decisions that will be made. And I would like I would prefer that we do it internally and then have a council of as much say, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'know, where we decide who we're going to interview from the entire pool of resumes that meet the minimum requirements that we decide are important but that we work as the Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hearing your comments as an alternative idea. Keep in mind that you can also ask a firm. They can do the brochures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the outreach.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then you can ask to look at everything that's submitted. I mean, you can still do that. I think it's the the outreach that we just don't have the internal capabilities for. And in terms of setting the amcu's interest or the minimum qualifications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, sifting through 100 resumes, again, our staff is really, really. Booked up right now. And so I'm not sure that we're going to be able.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To so personally then I would be interested in someone that does this really as little as possible. I really think that they can they can decide where they're going to post. I mean, with our input, we can help come up with ideas of where to post.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is very easy nowadays with social media and the internet and people I think really do know. Executives know where to look. But then I would want to hire someone that does as little as possible. We come up with the minimum requirements as opposed to having someone that really is owning it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's my concern. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member, I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Guess to kind of maybe add to that and see if those concerns could be alleviated. Is is the proposal that you would just go out if we said, we want you to hire somebody, we don't care who it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then you would just go off and do it. I mean, could we say. Pick somebody and bring them back here and let's talk to them. And if we don't like them, I know it's still kind of the interview process, but I'd really like to really to meet the person who's going to be doing the search for us'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and ask them questions and have them hear from us what we're looking for and have them hear from the public, you know, so they can get a flavor of of our culture and our city. And if that doesn't work well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We could decide, well, maybe we want to go with it. You know, go back to you and say, okay, bring back a different search firm. Or we could say. Okay. We don't like the search firm idea now that we've heard it in more detail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to go internal or just have them do, as the mayor suggested, the minimal amount of of work. And then we can do the. I don't know. I just. I'm a little uncomfortable just saying, go off, pick somebody and then we'll hear from you in however many months it is when there's a, you know, a list'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of finalists.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wouldn't work that way. Again, the the process would be is we'd get into go into a contract with a search firm, and then they would immediately come back and then engage in discussions with you on your candidate profile and find out exactly what you're looking for, how much involvement you want to have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then it would be a very much of a one on one relationship with them. And you know what you need.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess the weight of this responsibility is is heavy in on this. So but I appreciate I just worry that we're going to do it. I want to make sure we do it right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Anderson Madumere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rascoff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the same time, I first of all, I think we need to heed staff saying that they don't have the wherewithal and the the capability of doing this search. I think we would be selling ourselves short if we simply relied on social media.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think there's some really competent firms out there, and I think we'll see that when we do look at maybe a couple of them, but once we select them and you know, let's cross that bridge when we come to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the idea that we have them do as little as possible. I mean, let's get the our money's worth out of the contract that we enter into. We can always make our decision. And I, I do appreciate the that the mayor came from the school board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city is not the school board in. And I think the school board chose an excellent superintendent and he'd worked there before because I met him when he was the assistant superintendent. So, you know, whether social media was a major factor, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think that this is an opportunity for us to see just what's out there and to, you know, find out what we might not even know about what the potential is. And, you know, at the end of the day, we want to do what's best for the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member de soccer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll just say quickly. I think our city staff, Stephanie Sierra, has outlined a process for me at least. She's answered questions that I had. I think her main value proposition proposition tonight, what I'm hearing is that you need a search firm because of their professional capabilities, which go a long way in attracting the right set of candidates'",
        "'speaker_5': '. With regard to professional capabilities, what that means is the glossiness of your brochure, the wording that you use, the the channels through which you deliver your marketing materials, including the various social media outlets readily available to us. By the same token, maybe there are some social media outlets that we're not very well aware of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think the core proposition you're making about going with a professional in my from my vantage point, I buy into and also the way in which you outline it that. Once you're working with a professional service, that it's flexible in terms of how you engage the city council as well as the communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I hear that as well. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree with the comments that I don't want. This Council will lose the opportunity to vet all the applicants. I think it's very important. The. We understand that. And I think in front of that, I think it's very important that we have established some parameters of what we want and whether glossy brochures should the way people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or looking for jobs. Still look for jobs. I, I have a hard time in, in today's state, so I don't know that we need the the 20,000 plus. Firm, and I'm the only reason I'm considering having a professional help is that from your statement, as you don't have enough people to execute this, even if you felt confident'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that you could go to the League of California Cities newsletter or wherever you these things are posted these days and and do it in a timely manner so that we can get some recruits in here to interview.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was only saying glossiness as an illustration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I keep hearing brochures. I don't know that nobody uses brochures anymore, but.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, absolutely. It's it's it's very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think to use brochures having gone through the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did Riverside have a nice one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do. I think where I'm adamant is that I don't want them screening the applicant for us. I think it's very important that we get a shot at looking at whether it's a subcommittee or whether our council that we do the sifting and we do it against the criteria that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also can share. And then the individual criteria that we have as as council members on our own, because we all have to work with each other and we all have to the person will have the pleasure of reporting to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to choosing the firm I have, I would like to have more than one meet with us so that maybe two, maybe three that we get to choose who it is. I'm concerned if only one firm comes and talks to us and then we just take that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in regards to a color brochure, I actually I don't know if they mail them out to possible applicants. I don't really think it's necessary. I think really you can post anything nowadays and it gets distributed in regards to and I agree with Vice Mayor that we should be determining, seeing, seeing the applications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's very important. And in regards to if we're going to have a subcommittee, actually, but I would not support that. I would think all of us would want to be involved in this decision. Unless someone does not want to be there, that's up to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I personally would think that, you know, if we all want to be should we should all be included. And Member De SA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One final question for now. Now, when we went about hiring at the time, Debbie Kurita as the city manager, I think this was in 2004. I can't remember. We as a council also went down to the day of Santa Ana.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Does the budget contemplate those, those or any related kind of costs that are kind of. Different. And then perhaps, uh. Considered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. I don't understand why you went to Santa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, we went to go and interview people who. Worked with Debbie Kurita on the front. I mean, we went down to meet community members in Santa Ana, right? Mm hmm. Yeah. So I thought it was very helpful. I just need to know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could I just remember?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm still struggling with this because it's kind of a big decision. Yeah, I think the mayor could speak for herself, but I didn't interpret her comment about social media to say we would advertise on social media. I think her comment was people will know about this because of social media.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And yet we didn't use a search from last time and we got lucky and we were really blessed. The school board is maybe the school board, but it didn't use a search firm. For the current one. And I think everyone thinks he's amazing and the perfect fit for that job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there was not that agreement with the previous superintendent who was selected by a search firm. So. I'd really like to hear from one of these or two of these or three of these. If you think it only needs to be one, I guess I could go with one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I prefer more. But if they don't want to do a dog and pony show, then maybe, maybe we don't want to hire them. But I'd like to hear from them and just see what they have to offer before making the commitment that we're going to go with a search firm or that particular search firm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But. I may be in the minority there and may be outvoted, but that's just my hunch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to members comments, can I hear from the other members if they would be agreeable to having more than one firm? That's what you're saying. Members of your your your group there. Okay. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm. I think that I. You know, I think there's more than one good firm out there. I think Mr. Garbrandt is extremely capable. If, you know, why don't we let her go out and beat the bushes and see what she finds out?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But yeah, we could we could certainly consider more than one if you can do it in a timely fashion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I would propose is we maybe a. As for me, I saw this week agenda as a meeting where if I can get two or three folks to come up and talk about their experience, I can try and do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if I can't, I'll let you know. But I'll put out my feelers and I'll say, Hey, in this council meeting, this item will be agenda ized. I'm not sure if they'll want to be paid for their time or not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we can see who's available to do that, I think. I think that there are some of them are in our base in Sacramento, actually, most of them are based in Sacramento, though, come to think of it, it may be difficult for them to come to an evening meeting and they might want to be compensated, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That might be fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you want to make a comment and attitude?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Maybe I don't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So are we. And remind me, what were you just looking for? A recommendation from staff. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, some. Some direction. And tell me which direction you need me to go. And that's fine. I can. What I can do is I can call some search firms and find out whether they're amenable to coming to a council meeting and discussing a little bit about their process so you can feel more comfortable about them, kind of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'look them in the eyes and all that good stuff. And I can see how successful I am doing that.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'One of them. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So I think I know, for example, of one particular firm who's in Southern California who's excellent. In fact, we tried to use her for our finance director position and she was completely booked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm on an h.r. LISTSERV and so i get a lot of traffic about who are good, you know, good folks to use. My only concern about the about what Mr. Trauger Brant has. I'm sorry. Your Brent's here just like sorry to call you Stephanie is that you might exclude people who are not local and then that just'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean it maybe that's okay with you. But I know, for example, that this one in particular is an excellent firm and they are from Southern California. And so you might by requiring them to show up, you might exclude them from your possible list of folks.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You, you know, go out and. I don't know. That's just my thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my take on it is it's, you know, we've got still one more item. So is that we've agreed that we're going to go with an outside search for Miss Garrabrants. Sierra is going to contact a couple of them and see about getting them here for presentation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think it's productive to make judgments about what they will and won't respond because we haven't even contacted them yet. But I think I think we'll know more when we know more when we hear back. But I think this is a good first step to take in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So and just so I understand, we're not talking about a special meeting, just an agenda item on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and hopefully it would be early so they could just come and right on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you get, if you ask eight people and none of them say, you know, I'm not going to do that. Then we'll know. And maybe then we'll know that we we have to give you direction to pick one and just bring one back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know. I just. I want to close, just like the mayor and the vice mayor want to see every applicant. You know, I don't want to close off any doors on how we do the selection. Too soon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in regards to a subcommittee of council, we want to give her feedback at this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think we're going to be able to agree on who that is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so I think we're in agreement that we would all want to be included in the process. Were there any other issues that you had wanted? Feedback? No.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That gives me some direction on how to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Or Park and Webster Street? It was part of the charge of the Economic Development Commission to provide input in that. And it was one of the most successful programs that we had on the streets. I think those small programs as well as the larger programs.'",

So I think there's a there's a synergy there with staff and and a body that can and help do some of the work that's intermediate between staff people and and the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And a lot of it depends on city council giving good direction.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, I'm pretty impressed by the list that that he put together. That's even more than I expected when we first discussed this. So I think this merits. I think this merits moving on this moving it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'That's really the thought that crossed my mind. I think there is a lot of attention in the media in terms of business interaction, working with city staff, doing the legwork and then bringing in the ask force as a kind of a closer of sorts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And frankly, I think the story of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right, right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Speed, in a way, is emblematic of that, given that the owner of that business bumped into an alum even when he was at a at a conference or workshop in Healdsburg. I remember this story to me. That's kind of what all of the task forces used.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Person. Human contacts that they have. Recognizing that, you know, task force is going to do legwork. That's that's going to fall on staff. So that was something that we. Um, certainly I think best in 2014, and I'm not sure that it's been given.'",
        "'speaker_5': '2013. 2014. I'm not sure it's been given time to to attempt to reach its potential yet. So that's the thought that crosses my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amir have spot. Do what I said. Just just a question. My understanding and this is my information is that the task force was never seated and never met. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the city council in October of 2013 voted to adopt an ordinance disbanding the EDC and voted to look to a different format for undertaking these same kinds of activities that have been outlined by the Vice Mayor via a Mayor's Task Force for Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the idea was to really look at a structure that would be more flexible and more nimble than kind of the more traditional economic development commission. A lot of the activities that have been identified about business attraction, retention, expansion are confidential.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When they start out, they need to be kept confidential and the ability to work with high level representatives of the business community in a confidential nature and then bring the project forward to the public with. You know, receptions and press conferences and that kind of thing was one of the focuses of of a group that where you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'could rely on individual members of that committee to help us reach out and kind of leverage our resources with the specialized sectors that we've identified as being important to Alameda and really creating ambassadors who would work with us on a more one on one and more flexible basis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that is the structure that we were proposing in 2013, and that is the structure that staff is recommending that we continue to work with and put in place.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to speak to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Could I ask a question of your comment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And so one more thing and one more point just that might help inform the discussion is that we do have scheduled a presentation on April 7th about our economic development division, which incidentally, is the exact one year anniversary of Darryl's hire date.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And he we're proposing to present to you what we've been doing with the division over the last 12 months, and that that may give you more information to inform the decision about moving forward with the more traditional commission as it was composed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Prior to 2013 or looking at the more sort of what we think is the more kind of structure that reflects the best practices of undertaking economic development and business recruitment, attraction and retention activities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ASHCROFT?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I was going to say, I thought there had been an agenda item, maybe the last meeting or so, that very presentation. And I was just asked I was going to ask if that had been scheduled to come back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's our PowerPoint.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is in legislator and going through the internal review process and will be coming coming to a council meeting soon. It's scheduled for April 7th. So that's your next meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'd like to ask the question in regards to these tasks that the Vice Mayor has laid out. Are some of these how would staff propose? If we if we continue on the path of having the mayor's economic development committee, then how how are these tasks addressed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, the issues that have been identified are the initiatives that have been identified, I think are a combination of high level policy issues, for example, the enhanced infrastructure of district financing. That is a high level policy issue where you might want an analysis and input from folks who are familiar with it, with financing and former redevelopment legislation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to advise the council. Some issues are more operational about, you know, how we would implement the facade improvement program that is more of an operational issue where we might not you know, we might not come to council, we may, you know, get authorization for the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then staff would come up with with the implementation procedures for that. We we would be we are going to be proposing as part of the budget cycle to update the 2008 Economic Development Strategic Plan. That is a key initiative that we would definitely look to reaching out to the business community for input on the strategic plan'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and coming back to council for input and feedback and ultimately approval of an updated strategic plan. So there are a number of important initiatives that I think you might benefit from hearing from the economic development manager about how we're currently implementing a number of these strategies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're undertaking focus groups with representatives of some of our key sectors. We're going to be starting with the maritime industry and we're looking at the hospitality industry. So these are focus groups that we're as we as staff are moving forward with now to solicit input and information that can then be used to inform our policy recommendations to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the Council. So we would see the economic development panel, the mayors panel, as I like to think of it, as kind of leveraging staff resources and allowing access to some of the key business folks in the city of Alameda, some of our key sectors and experts on some of these key topics like infrastructure financing, how to add'",
        "'speaker_3': 'value to city owned property. And we could reach out and we we leverage the work of staff that way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So in regards to that, for me personally, this is a committee that was started back in 2013, apparently, and of October 2013. It's something that I those this is something I and staff have been working on talking to businesses and I think it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to give that a chance because I really appreciate the confidentiality of working with businesses and how important it is that we leverage staff's time as well as we have some amazing businesses in town that may not be there, but they but they would want to discuss may not be appropriate at a commission level'",
        "'speaker_0': 'here. Sitting up here five people on the dais with staff. And so I would like to give this right, this economic committee, an opportunity to. See how it works, working with staff. And then if in fact, at some point council thinks that we want to try to do the commission and it may be for other tasks, quite'",
        "'speaker_0': 'honestly, it may be for some other things that staff at this point is thinking that they would be sounds like more appropriate to have presentations actually to council to make decisions.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'From my vantage point, I mean many cities have economic development commissions and rightfully so. So I understand the place of an economic development commission. But I think to me, the value added when it comes to. What I call what we're calling the mayor's task force.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Committee for Economic Development. What we're talking about is really a group of people who are positioning themselves with regard to economic development implementation. The Commission certainly would have a role when it comes to economic development planning. But by the same token.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You could conceivably have the economic develop, the updated economic development strategic plan serving as the goals and objectives and the. And of the setting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Economic Development Task Force, the mayor's economic development task force, when it comes to doing work. And also when it comes to that, the staff person, economic development manager doing work. You update the economic development strategic plan from 2008 from 2000 to 2008.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now five. Almost ten years later. 2015. And that updated economic development plan says, you know what our goals and what are what are the strategies that we're going to put in place to achieve each of the goals and the implementation and who's going to do what?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And a lot of that who because you've got the plan in place with implementation, is the staff person. So the staff person is going to look out for opportunities with regard to businesses in certain industry clusters. Now we're the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mayor's task force comes into my mind. Is there the closer? At the point in time that that our economic development manager has identified certain opportunities. We're going to wow those opportunities because now they're going to see on. They're going to see this task force with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Very reputable companies. They're going to see them either in person or they're going to see them on the letterhead. They're going to say, hey, this is a city that's geared to acting. So in my mind, all that can happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Independent Development Commission. And to the extent that it has not yet happened. Me. Argues for giving it a chance to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So just for clarification, and so the term is mayor's task force, but I believe the actual choice, it's more like a select committee and probably it would be input from the entire council if we were to go that direction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm wondering if, given that we're going to have a presentation on the Economic Development Department, what they're proposing in terms of updating the strategic plan, if it might behoove us all to put off. I know we don't like to delay decisions, but I'm wondering whether it might make sense to wait until at least we've had the benefit'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of hearing that presentation. I do believe we were supposed to have heard it by now, but it was one of those agendas that had to get short because of the hour. I think. I think the vice mayor has proposed some some very interesting ideas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just thinking that we don't know. But there might be overlap with what's already in the in the works with the Economic Development Department and Community Development. So is there a way I don't know whether it's just a report or whether there's an action attached to the the the the report that's coming to us, sorry to make'",
        "'speaker_6': 'you read back and forth, but is there some sort of action associated with the item coming to us on April 7th?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Coming to the council is a PowerPoint presentation that is for information only. It is not structured at this point to include in the action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So could we discuss this item along with that? At that point, would staff be the input that's appropriate regards to the next step?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do we? Yes, we. I think staff could take direction as as an aspect of that presentation. And it's time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To do that before April seven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we would have time to I mean, I suppose we could change the freeze and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The agenda hasn't gone out right for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The media.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we could add that in a fraction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, if I understand correctly, will continue this item. Into a spot right behind that PowerPoint presentation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh. If I can help, maybe. I don't know that you need to continue this item if you're actually. The referral process allows for the council to decide whether it wants to come back or not with some staff work and this could be what its coming back as.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. I'd like to actually direct staff to include this idea of economic development commission in the analysis. I mean, is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also I would actually so I would like to also include, you know, their discussion of pros and cons. How they would address these issues that are being raised here. But their recommendation is and hear back from our economic devil.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we could we can add a couple of more slides to the PowerPoint presentation to address the the issues that have been raised this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And could we make it an actionable item?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. That's what it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is. Yes, we can. I've just got to. I'm not trying to overcommit you, Miss Potter, though, if you don't think you can do that level of analysis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think what we would do is capture the some of the pros and cons, some of our what stats proposals are about how we might recommend the the the input and advice and sort of strategic help on economic development in the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can certainly do the PowerPoint slides, I think, to a to a level that would help inform the discussion by the council and then receive direction from from the council on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor, does that sound good?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other council member comments? So that satisfies this item? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And now we have council communications. Any comments? Yes. Member Desai?'"
