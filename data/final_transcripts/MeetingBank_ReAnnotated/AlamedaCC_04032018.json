        "'speaker_1': 'Intelligent Emergency Operations Management Software.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And did you have specific questions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I did. My my question had to do with we've been seeing a lot of different contracts come through. And some of the other ones that were in the the consent calendar also included information regarding different bids through an RFP.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just my question had to do with whether or not we conducted an RFP for this software. And then my other question is, my understanding is that it is for emergency operation community communications. But seeing as this question came up with other vendors, I just wanted to know if there if this vendor provides any of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'records, any of the data or provides any of the data with DHS or ICE.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So staff who's going to be have access to it? Questions we have.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Have a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Question from back there, so. And we'd like you to repeat it. And I think Captain Oliver is actually going to have to answer it, but. Okay. We'll see what we can do for you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So two questions. One is, if we conducted an RFP when we were figuring out which vendor to go with for our EOC. And then the second question is whether or not this vendor has some sort of BSI or data broker agreement with Department of Homeland Security or ICE.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's any retention of data and if they share.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So on the first question, we didn't actually conduct an RFP, but we had vendors, about five vendors, and I could get you a list. I don't have all the names because we've had it for a couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we we looked at them, we tested them, we had them come in and present to a group of people, including at the time Bob Pond, who was the acting assistant city manager. And he actually oversaw the build of the EOC as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we looked at a variety.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of softwares and and came to the conclusion that for the value of what we got, it was the best choice. So we researched other departments that had some of these softwares and then came to the conclusion.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Mm hmm. So it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, like most subscriptions you renew annually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't have any connection to ICE.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's an internal use software.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it doesn't go out to the public. It's not available to the public. I don't have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't have the city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here, but it does keep.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A transcript, which is good for us when we're asking for reimbursement on disasters. So whenever you have a transcript of something, there's probably.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'You know, public information records.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it's controlled by us. Right. The data and the transcript doesn't get sent externally. That's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, no. It's completely internal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I wanted to clarify, when you said it's not in regards to the public, people that are part of cert are part of this is what we used to, right? Yeah, we have rolled into that. As much as it's not open to the public, it is open to those of us that are part of cert, which I'",

        "'speaker_3': 'April 12th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Starts the next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Course series. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we'll have two more towards the fall. We kind of take a summer break and do some individual classes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Yeah. And we can go online and and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Register.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And find out about it. And it's free and it's free.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my question on this, this sounds like pretty awesome software. And I do understand that it's a renewal of a subscription that you've had and the software is manages communications in a disaster and linking parties in various parts of the city and to get information in real time out there, which is great and up on screens in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the EOC. My my question because this is 32,000 a year, up to ten for a ten year contract and then it can be renewed.

        "'speaker_2': 'and but future years funding remains at council discretion through the biennial budget process. My question is this. I mean, has the EOC established a budget for what you need? Because just at our last council meeting, when we were looking at the mid-year budget and sort of an overview, there was an item I think it was for remind'",
        "'speaker_2': 'me what it was, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was for the operating costs of the building, like gas and electric and some things like that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And all the things that come along with that. So we really do have some expenses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for clarity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, we thought it would be nice to have something you could really well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what I'd like to know is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd just like to add that it's, it's part of our mid-cycle we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can anticipate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, absolutely. So that is actually in the mid-cycle as part of our.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That I will hold my questions until then. But, but, and so just for clarity, we would get an overview of what a year's budget for the EOC look like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're bringing this to you now because of your $75,000 cap. And so, you know, we don't spend.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That each year, but over the course of the term of going on with a subscription.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fee, it will go over the budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So understood. And I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you for answering my questions. And with that, I'm prepared to move that. We the recommendation to authorize city manager to execute a ten year contract with 2 to 5 year options to renew in an amount not to exceed $32,000 annually for a total not to exceed $640,000 over 20'",

        "'speaker_0': 'That was a mouthful. So our second it that I had had a question, I wanted to clarify as much as I think you were trying to say this as much as it is a ten year contract are being asked to approve you can also terminate you said with 60 days notice we're not we can always get out'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the ten years. Yes, very simple to get out of. It's like a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Subscription.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, it's a little padded in case they you know, we have some, you know, add some more licensing or do any additions or do any extra work. So it's actually not that much per year. I think we were at 28,000, including all our CERT members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it is lower than that. We just wanted to.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'At any time. So thank you for clarifying that member matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's a very important point for the public to know because 20 years in the software contract is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now. It seems like a very long time, but you can get out at any time. And it was just too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just wondering why if we get out there and we just buy a subscription the next five years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We we could, but then we'll have to repeatedly come back and ask if we're really enjoying it. We'll move on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we're not, we'll get out. And right now it's been really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really good and usable software.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For us, really proving itself. All right. So there's motion on second. All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. Thank you. So that completes our consent calendar. Now we are on 6 a.m..'",

    "Citywide Dockless Bike Sharing Program and Safety Requirements.": [
        "'speaker_8': 'One of the things that some other cities have done is they've allowed for different businesses and things to petition to put these in. But I was wondering if is part of the RFP process, whoever the vendor is, and I know these obviously don't get locked up in the sense that a normal bike would get locked up with'",
        "'speaker_8': 'an actual physical lock, but it still signals a place to actually dock the bike. And so if they, you know, if as part of the RFP, they would be willing to fund more of these on perhaps some of our main streets where we do have our bike lanes and perhaps some on Central Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We do have some shops on Central Avenue throughout town and things like that where they could put in for those and that would be funded by the company and could be a place to signal, Hey, this is where you could bring your line bike or whatever bike it is, or if you're riding a regular bike, you could'",
        "'speaker_8': 'use an actual physical lock to to lock it up. The other thing that had come up is I know that lime bike had done some helmet giveaways at the different high schools. You know, again, if there are through part of the RFP, they make it easy for people to actually get the helmets again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's something. I know that. I know those laws are difficult to enforce, but the easier we can make it for people to actually get helmets, the more likely they're going to use them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Question Member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ashcroft So something we can have a robust discussion on this comes back on May 1st. But the there there is also a reason it's accessibility to to have dockless bikes. I think I understand the vice mayor to be saying, but in some areas where they're maybe not being parked properly, it could be a place where they're parked'",
        "'speaker_2': ', but they are going to be dockless bikes because they don't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Require I'm not I'm not asking for a docking station. But the way that we had talked about this before, when we were talking about bike access in Alameda, that you could put, you know, a place, a docking station for like a normal bike, right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Where you could actually lock your bike up. You know, the the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, it's a, it's a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Bike rack. Well it's not, it's a station, but it's, you know, talking about. Right. But that could have the branding of whatever the company is on it or they could put their logo. And you know, part of what I've seen them do on Park Street is they've they have lined up line bikes near the bike racks that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we do have out. Okay.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thermoplastic striping or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'To help encourage them or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Exactly. Because and just to finish my thought, the the advantage and there's pros and cons of both. But the advantage of dockless bikes are they don't take up any of the public thoroughfare right away with their docking stations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, it's good to have more bikes out there. We still on a trip over them, so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member matters and I just want to make sure that this online by not on us by getting free use of this and I don't I really don't know I'm curious of how they really make their money because I think it's selling information just like everybody else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We get a benefit, but they should be required and penalized if they're allowing underage kids to ride. If that's on them and if they're kids who are required to have a helmet, are not wearing a helmet that's on them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that's what I'm looking for in the contract and I think the rest are good ideas, but they should be on line bikes time and bikes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me and them around here just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, I was just going to say in some of these other cities, it has been on whatever the the Dockless bike company to to either put up the striping or to pay for, you know, bike racks in front of other places where they aren't traditionally.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the other the other thought that we had had we had discussed this was a concern that we had had was the liability. So if a child is injured and there's some sort of, you know, something that happens, what's the liability to the city?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Are we liable? Is that going to be covered in in the in the contract and making sure because it's a it's a big concern.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everybody just be quick. And I kind of like the lime bikes. I mean, you're probably going to have a few scofflaws, but I think overall, I mean, just the idea that, you know, we can have an easy way to use a bicycle in town and we can do it in an open.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guess open is probably the best word. You know, it's not dockless where it sounds like it's super secure. We're not trusting our residents to use it properly. So, I mean, just as an overall general thing, I like it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, it's nice to see people writing or writing them around. You know, there is some anecdotal because I did see one sitting outside the state building I think yesterday when I left the office. So, I mean, there is some anecdotal evidence that they're popping up in places they shouldn't pop up but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Didn't bring it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Back. I know. And, you know, as far as the helmets, you know, somebody passed around something on the Internet last week that, you know, part of the reason we have accidents is because cars are hitting people, you know, not because we have, you know, a failure of people to wear helmets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, I think we we owe it to our residents, especially as more of them ride bikes to make sure that we ensure their safety while they're doing that. And, you know, it may not be simply. Requiring a helmet or ticketing or whatever people are asking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, making sure that, you know, we we we plan automobile traffic in such a way that it doesn't endanger bike riders and pedestrians.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it is that I want to be very clear. It is California state law that anyone under 18 riding a bicycle has to have a helmet on. That's not arbitrary. That's not anyone up here asking. It is actually California state law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I personally think that it is critical that we take it seriously and. So so that that's an issue there. I know other cities have figured out a way to charge more initially. And then if you return the bike to an acceptable location through the geofencing that then you get money back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you don't return it to an acceptable place, that right costs you more. And I think we should look at that type of pricing so that it's naturally and whomever is doing this right is their company. But there are things that I guess that other cities have required.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Them to be creative and they can because it's there's technology nowadays. So I think that that's something we can look at. Of course, we all have seen. I'll say, first of all, I do like the idea of having more bikes available.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You see many more people around. I don't know if it's any more, but there are people I know that they've had bikes stolen and they can now ride a lime bike or they don't have the means. So so you do see them being used.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That being said, you also see them unfortunately. I recently came back on Bart and the Fruitvale District. There was one thrown in the middle of the walkway and you had the picture of Oakland's bikes all lined up nice and neat in their dock stations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then right in the middle of the path, you had a lime bike that came from Alameda. And I think that's a serious problem. And Oakland is keeping their bikes nice and orderly and somehow Alameda bikes are ending up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Obstructing the walkway there. So I feel like we really do have to take this seriously. It's really not appropriate for us to be littering Oakland when they're trying hard to have their areas. Neat. So the rest of it, I think, is and therefore I look forward to them coming back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did talk with someone from Lime Bike about can you put it in your program? Is it someone make them say that they are over 18 or if they're under 18 then say, do you have your helmet? Yes or no?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And try to build it into their program. But I think it is important to put it on them if they insist on being not wearing a helmet and letting their kid ride a bike without a helmet as opposed to being on our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other comments, and I appreciate you taking all this in and trying to build your RFP so that we end up with responsible bikes. Thank you. Okay. Nine B, and that's number mattresses.'"

        "'speaker_4': 'way. The robot doesn't have a license, doesn't pay a tax. You know, we're responsible for street damage on the sidewalks and the homeowner is responsible for sidewalk itself and bought boxes making money and taking jobs. So. I think we should ban them.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And at that time of staff, I'm not sure that this actually will take a heck of a lot of the time to come up with the ban. So you may have a time estimate of how much time you need to look at this one compared to some of the other issues that we give to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that now all those in favor I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that with the clarification that we're keeping the rating the same as this time. Yeah. Okay. On that basis I'll join in vote.'"

    "Clarification and Removal of MF Housing Overlay for Various Sites. (Mayor Spencer)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. So that passes unanimously. Thank you very much. Next item nine C. Okay. This is a referral that I had brought before. I think it was addressed this evening. However, I would like us to have at some point a bigger discussion and then vice mayor brought this up to really clarify.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More clearly. But what our options are. And I appreciate the 20 or 30 page legal memo. I just think that that might be a little hard for many people to digest the possible, if it could be, if you all can figure out a way to make it clearer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that'd be very helpful. Everyone go to that?'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So I'll just be brief on this one. And this may be something that we put off, but I recall that when we had the meeting where we discussed the bond, there was some confusion at the end on what it would mean if we went over 11 three times in a row and whether that meant that we had'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to add one meeting. Per month, one meeting or some other number of meetings. But I also know that the clerk is working on bringing back an item to discuss the whole issue that our subcommittee council member as the Ashcraft and I worked on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is why we did this together. So, I mean, it may make sense to bring this back as part of that discussion, given that I don't know if we're under the gun now because we make it done before 11 and then the clock will be again starting at zero.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then it may not be an issue until after we or if we adopt any any changes. So I'm happy to defer this, but I will let my colleague who jointly authored it.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Yeah. And I'll just chime in that. I mean, it was almost sort of a placeholder, but coming soon. Ms.. Speiser, do we do we know when we're going to? That's okay. I'm not rushing you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But what I would say is that it was a joint effort of the the Open Government Committee. Councilmember Odie, myself, the city clerk, was very helpful in city attorney's office also. And I think we've got some pretty good proposals coming to you and this may actually be moot.'",
