        "'speaker_4': 'And in that section, there are two sentence, two paragraphs. One, which went one payment was comprised of three vendor invoices totaling 1700 dollars that were individually below the threshold requiring a contract. But the city used the vendor throughout the fiscal year for various repairs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And cumulatively, those small contracts cumulatively totaled $129,800. And in a separate item, there was something similar where a vendor did work for 1300 dollars. But cumulatively, when you add it up, all the different contracts, cumulatively the amount of money spent on the second vendor was roughly to $296,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the basic question is, oh, by the way, for for purposes of background, for for the public. In these situations are called out within the memorandum of internal control because the city has a policy that requires the city as a council to sign off on certain contracts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the the sign off occurs when a certain threshold occurs. But a dollar threshold, when that dollar threshold is exceeded, the council has to approve it. But in these instances, the memorandum is pointing out just two instances where someone has these very, very small contracts that if you look at it individually, you know, it doesn't surpass the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'threshold. But when you add them all together, suddenly it's a lot of money. So the question I have is, uh. Are we implementing fixes so that something like this doesn't happen again? And is that in place now?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Elena Darrah, finance director for the City. So, yes, we are attempting to fix it. There's a number of issues.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At hand here. One, we have quite a few brand new personnel which we need to train them the new on existing policies.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'How much we actually pay in total.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Nor is there a policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or practice to determine, well, is it a rolling 12.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Months? Rolling five.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Years? Is it one fiscal year at the time? So that's part of the items that we would be looking at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when you look at the purchasing policy revisions, so there's a multitude of things that need to be looked at and determine how we want.'",

The next plan step or to redesign current process to provide for greater efficiencies.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Do you want to drive? And I said, I thought we'd take public transit. And I slapped him. And we walked across the street and we took AC Transit to the Fruitvale Station and we hopped on a BART train to Union City.'",

My issue was that the proposed election, in my opinion, was inequitable because it excluded basically anyone who's not a property owner in Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But that is one of the one of the cons with moving forward with the general election. The way that we're attempting to move forward to address some of that concern is in our outreach and citywide community survey. We want to get as much representation in that survey from folks who are not property owners.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'E we yes. So the results from this survey, we'd anticipate about 2 to 3000 responses and that will be a statistic, a statistically significant sample and so equivalent to what folks think of in terms of polling results that those are scientific surveys.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we'll be making sure that because you can get 2 to 3000 people to respond, but they may not be demographically representative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Representative, of course.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So we'll be comparing that to renters versus homeowners.

That will be a scientifically valid survey.

        "'speaker_7': 'So I heard the answer to the vice mayor's a question that we would reevaluate this in July. But, you know, the staff report says by approving this a contract amendment, we will proceed according to the timeline below. And the timeline below does not give a decision point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It basically outlines proceeding with a election that, in my opinion, disenfranchizes over half of our voters. So I mean, is there some flexibility in this? And if we if we did have a decision point in July, would it still be a contract at this rate?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hundred and 66,000 or. I have another thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mr. Garland, if you could hold your answer, which is to me and I'd like to hear from our city manager, Mr. Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor, as a Ashcraft and Councilmember Ody, I would recommend what you would do is just change the motion and just say direct to come back in July with the report or if it ends up moving to September by, let's say July with the report at that time providing options of how you would move forward with election, I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would just revise the motion in that way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's an inspired suggestion. And I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wasn't finished.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Yes. Okay. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. That input from our new city manager working already in the first hour of his first meeting. I just still have a fundamental problem with I know it's easier. I know it's cheaper. But the right to vote here is not come cheap, is not come free to people, has not come easy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'People have died. People have bled. We fought a civil war. We fought a revolutionary war. We fought fascism. And I just don't think it's something we should take away because it's easier and cheaper and disenfranchizing half of our over half of our voters are renters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to me, it's just a slap in the face to us as the only renter on this council that we're not going to have a say in this. So I will make a motion. I think I'm going to make the motion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So then you guys could decide if you want a second hit with the suggestions by our city manager that in July we have a decision point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And we'd like to hear from the acting city attorney, Mr. Ash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor. I would just also add that. That I think that we would want to take a look at the various timelines concerning the election. We may need to bring something back to the Council before July. If we're going to look at a a an election that doesn't necessarily involve property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's some timelines there. There may be a need to have the election only at the general election. The issue about majority versus two thirds. There's a number of issues that that will flow from that decision, and we may need to have that decided before a July date, because that gets pretty close to a cutoff date if you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'were going to have a special election, for example, in November. So not saying that we will, but I want to just keep that option open so that we can have a further discussion with Liam's office and come back with something more definite to the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To supplement that, we'd have to have ballot language ready and approved and then delivered to the county by early August. So that would necessitate, I think, some action before then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I didn't hear a second to the motion, so I'm going to make my comment now. I appreciate every thing, the comments we've heard. I also want to caution against conflating two issues that I think both deserve our serious attention, and that is we do need to protect our renters and and our residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's very important giving them the opportunity to perhaps vote down this assessment because they fear it would raise their rent. It might be a possibility, but it could be short sighted. And one of the other things we have to consider as a council is what this means for our city in terms of protecting our information infrastructure'",
        "'speaker_0': ', our ability to respond and be prepared for a sea level rise. And as far as a special election, I don't know about the rest of my colleagues. I can say having just come off of one, I'm certainly not excited about doing another one this year any time soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that is I do I do think that our new city managers will stop calling you new after the next meeting or so. But I think the and the suggestion is is an inspired one. But again, that last meeting in July then takes us into the August recess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we wouldn't be coming back until September. I guess so. So Council. What's your pleasure? Yeah, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm assuming we don't have any public speakers. Oh, right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, you you didn't have any, and one was just requested, but you've already made a motion, so I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Know that's why I'm not seconding the motion yet. I think we should take the public view.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, okay. I guess. You know, I didn't ask if there was public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There wasn't the motion, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we'll make a little exception here, because I didn't maybe if you heard me call for public comment, that would have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, it's Ruth. Abby.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thought it might be. Hi. Come on at Miss Abby. Ever use the microphone and we could all hear you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry to butt in. So I'm Ruth Abby with Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. I am coming up to speak in favor of going forward with the study but also to go forward with a property tax assessment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a property vote.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think that what you have to take into consideration is that, you know, what are the consequences of not spending this money? What are the consequences are not asking your residents to to pay for this fee to to have a general.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Election, which requires.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A two thirds vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Extremely difficult to pass, means that you would not be really favoring the idea of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Stormwater fee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so if you really think that's what you want and you want to put that level of scrutiny of a two thirds vote to out to our public, that's a really heavy lift for us. And it requires a huge effort on the campaign.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. So it's possible to do it would really strain a lot of resources of NGOs and others who would have to get involved in it. And the question is, isn't it what we all want? I mean, can't we find out through surveys and through other measures and outreach and education that this is what we want from our'",
        "'speaker_8': 'public, that we actually want to protect ourselves from sea level rise and flooding. So, you know, maybe it's not as hard of a of of a case that I want to make, but I feel as though if you direct the city staff to go forward with the general election, it will be because you do not favor the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'idea of having a stormwater fee on property. This is a stormwater fee on property. It's property owners that are appropriate to weigh in on whether they should have this fee. The California legislature. Has put a lot of imposition on local governments in raising fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, and this is one of them. You know, we this is a way we can raise fees. It's very difficult to raise fees. This is one of the ways that we can raise it by going to property owners.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just wanted to put in that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As an organization that is really going to favor the idea of protecting ourselves from sea level rise. I would want you to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Direct staff appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And really consider whether you actually want to to have this as a consequence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you for the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Abby. And now Rosemary Knox.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Confirm and your next as well. I see you're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hinting that the motion on the floor is is to the staff recommendation with the city manager's addendum to. And so I will second that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I just want a little clarification. The motion is what again, to come back with the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Present options when it returns as outlined by the city manager in when it returns in July to allow the council to decide or sooner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or sooner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or sooner. Okay. We've had a motion. It's been settled. And I believe Councilmember Vella has your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we're making a lot of assumptions. Part of what we're trying to do is actually go out and get information from the public about what they are not interested in. And I think we're trying to do that in two different ways.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One, we're trying to pull the property owners, which could, you know, could be indicative of kind of where they're at and whether or not they're actually supportive of this fee going out to a ballot at election and mail ballot election.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But two, to actually do the general kind of polling and I know that it's not going to be a scientific poll, but do we really want to spend 100 or $200,000 on a scientific poll? I just I don't think that that cost is something that we really want to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that we can get to it by going to community groups and putting the pull out there. I do think that, again, I don't necessarily you know, I want to see what the the the property owners and the general voting public have to say, because any fee increase is not necessary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've seen fee increase votes by property owners in other districts get voted down in Alameda. So I don't necessarily think one group is is more favorable to a fee increase than another. So I don't want to make that assumption.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's why we're actually that's why I'm going to be supportive of this contract and the amendments is to actually get that information, to find out if there's any there there where we can move forward. And I think in any event, we're going to have to figure out how to fund this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So whether it's through a fee increase, through property fee increase or through another sort of fee increase, we are going to have to fund this. This is a very real issue. Our streets do flood and we have a major stormwater issue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've experienced it every winter. I personally have seen it happen where it's impacted me and other folks on my street. So it's something that I know hits at the heart of what we're trying to deal with. And if our stormwater system there is not working, we're going to be experiencing continuous flooding and that's going to impact renters'",
        "'speaker_8': ', property owners and everybody else in it. And it currently is. So I'm ready to support this tonight. I'll support it with the amendments. I have no problem with it coming back with the a plethora of options. But I do think that we need to include in those options.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If we don't vote to put this out there and to go to a vote, how are we going to fund it? Because that absolutely has to happen. We can't just say no thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr.. ALLEN I'll also add that the city has actually been under a consent decree over having sewage leak into the bay, and we've been, you know, paying and doing our share of the repairs required by that Councilmember Day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, so you're here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to say quickly that I'm supportive of gathering information, but frankly, I come into this not as a blank slate. I do have my my preferences. And it really has to do with seeing a fee that is adjusted to take into account intensity of uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me give you a case in point. Every time we have storm right around McDonald's, the hamburgers place, McDonald's on shoreline on Shoreline Drive, we always have flooding there. But by the same token, we also have a lot of multifamily apartments there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So whatever fee that we have, I think has to be calibrated to the intensity of uses. And so and I recognize that, you know, that we're at this point, we're just gathering information. But that is a certain concern of mine because it goes back to the hospital tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I look at summer hill, summer house, summer house homes only paying 298 and I'm paying the same amount.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in Councilmember Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, just the last thing since we had that public speaker, I mean, I don't think anyone argues with the need for this. I just think it's a basic civil rights issue that we're going to exclude our renter population, which is predominantly a less wealthy than property owners, which is predominantly more people of color, and is predominantly'",
        "'speaker_7': 'probably more senior. I mean, to me, it comes down to basic civil rights. And, you know, I'm not one to throw away someone's civil rights because it's easier. It's cheaper. I mean, I'm perfectly happy doing this. I think we should do it the right way and not, you know, not take away people's civil rights and their right'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But what we're voting on tonight is simply to go forward with the study and get the information, come back to this council with the information you've gathered in July or before then. Okay. So we've had a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've just you may.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Try to my only comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll let your expert consultants figure out how to do this. But if you're going to bring back online survey data, I would like to know who has taken that survey, because online surveys tend to target a very specific demographic of people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it is not necessarily representative of the city. And I am a little concerned that sometimes cities have a have a tendency to get lots of responses from the same types of people on online surveys. And then they come back and say, look at how many people we've heard from who say X, Y and Z.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they're often not the people that Councilmember Ortiz said. So I'm not getting into the ballot fight. I like the solution of just give us options and we'll have a conversation when that when that comes forward. This is clearly something that that we've discussed that I think is very important.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want that to be clear. I would just like to make sure that if we're going to go out and talk to community groups, as Councilmember Vela has suggested, that we know which community groups and those are listed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would like to be able to look at that list and say, I can see how that is representative of our community and not just the same four groups that we go out and talk to all the time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we're going to do online surveys, I would like to know what the demographic information is for those surveys so that we can then point to whether or not we actually feel that the responses were getting are indicative of our community or a certain aspect of our community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm happy to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for a point of understanding, what would you do to I mean, so survey results are returned and you get the information and you're not satisfied with the respondents. What would you do to compel more people or different people to respond?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I mean, sometimes we do we spend $25,000 to do a statistically significant Democrat study of demographics. We do one every two years for the city using EMC or any of the polling. It's you know, if that's what we're trying to I guess what I'm saying is I'm happy to say, to understand who's talking to me and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that, and I will accept that. But I don't think we should then say the community has said X, Y and Z. If it's not, this is the community that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I say so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the answer is we have to spend the money to collect the the survey responses. We are saying we want or we need to be careful and very thoughtful. And in pursuing the input from the community, the community that we say we want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do I hear? I hear cancer every day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I mean, it's an important point, but it does raise our logistical questions. So as we. Paul, are we saying then that our polling is going to include the Renner population, or is our polling going to be specific to those who will be voting at this point, which is primarily property owners?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I mean, so that's the question that has to be answered, I think, right now or well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Soon enough in our our motion is not to make the decision that we doing one or the other of those things. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And before I con Councilman Revelle and Mr. Garland, do you feel that you have enough direction? Come on up to the microphone. And while you're thinking of that Councilmember Villa want you in the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I just want to clarify. I didn't read anything about a poll. I thought that we were going to be conducting a survey, which is. Yeah, they're different. Well, they're but they're different. They are. They are different. And so, you know, when we say the word poll, we we literally mean go out and do a scientific poll'",
        "'speaker_8': 'where you look at, you know, number of times people voted, that sort of thing. That's not what we're giving direction on, is my understanding. We're giving direction on having a survey performed correct with it with a poll specific to property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's right. That it it's a scientifically valid poll just happens to be in writing and by mail for property owners. It could be the council's will to do both. In other words, to test out some of the similar questions and a telephone pole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there would be a segment of the polled respondents that, for example, would be renters, and that that's a potential for the council to consider in terms of moving forward and with full consensus.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's the cost of that split?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Probably double. What is it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Worth to have a telephone pole put in the field with results by July? I think we could get that done for about $30,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that would be contacting both renters and property owners or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, it'd be difficult. I think I'm by no means a pollster. I'd be different. I it difficult, I think to pull out property owners from their sample. So there would be some crossover. But the difference is with the telephone pole, you could see more specifically the broader representation of all our meetings who are not property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does that make sense?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, you probably enough for these purposes. Okay, i. I mean, I. I seems like there's at least two parts to this. So I'm hearing that we want to that the majority of the council may want to hear from all potential voters, renters or and homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But then there's another part. If we decide to make this a general election, then we raise the threshold for passage. And I mean, what and what then? I mean, the implications of that? Or do we want to wait and have that discussion when we see the results?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody, was that your hand up?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was kind of my answer. I assume we would those results would tell us. I mean, if the poll comes back in, 80% of the people are going to like this, then that informs a different decision than if if the numbers were different.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, this could be a super popular thing. We don't know. But we're being asked to basically foreclose on a path without having the full data in front of us. So I would imagine you kind of answered the question with your question, at least for my purposes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to speak for anyone else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, have we covered this territory enough? No, no, no. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember De just seems to me that earlier, rather than later, we need to hammer out the nature of this election. What is it going to be? Renters and homeowners and property owners? Because from the outset, when we're doing either polling or survey ing, you know, you need to know that because if you're a property owner and then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you feel somehow that the outcome of this is is being driven by by. But you know, people who aren't going to pay the fee, ostensibly. Potentially. Then maybe you have a different take on it. So I think we might want to have that conversation first as to, you know, is this going to be your your classic property'",
        "'speaker_4': 'owner based fee balloting or are we going to do something along the lines that Councilmember Odie wants? I think we should have that conversation first and then let's figure out what kind of polling and survey we're going to be doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I would then ask about the timing on that. But let's see, I saw I think I saw Councilmember Vela's hand up first and then the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I just want to be clear, the motion on that that's currently out there does not include polling because people keep talking about polling. And then I hear people say, well, I want polling so that if if the decision is that you want to amend, that you want to amend it so that you can include both some'",
        "'speaker_8': 'sort of poll as well as the the mail poll, a phone call or an email poll, then that needs to be amended. But the second thing is, I actually think that the question is the questions that we're looking at are do we want to do it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do we want to do the fee based off of intensity or do we want to do a flat fee increase? There are other questions out there that I think are going to dictate the response that you're going to get.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And certainly I think. We have to. We have to get the feedback on those sorts of things before we can make a decision about what we're going to pursue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And before I call on the Vice Mayor, so my question would be to the acting city attorney and Mr. Garland. Does it make a difference whether the vote, the eventual vote is for a flat fee or based on square footage of your property or some some more proportional individual formula?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can I go first? And the honorable city attorney will correct me. I think in this instance, there's got to be a nexus between the services provided through the stormwater fee and the actual property. And so it's very likely under either approach that it's going to get to something called impervious surface units, essentially an acre of property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How much payments on it? How much landscaping is on it? One's pervious ones not. And that drives the fee. And that's for larger than single family properties and then for single family properties. Since you had a study conducted to come up with a flat fee that averages out across all those properties using the same methodology, and that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that is under either scenario, that's that's the way we go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So it's looking like flat fee is what you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it's flat for single family homes and then it varies based on the conditions of the property for other all other properties.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Do you want to chime in second that whatever?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I don't disagree with that. The only thing that I'm a little bit uncertain about is the percentage that is needed to pass, depending on what what it is that's being considered. And I don't. It may well be two thirds, and it probably is, but I can't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can't say categorically right now that that's what it's going to be in all incidents, although I believe that's the case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Well, that's certainly something we would want clarified when you come back. I saw the vice mayor's hand up. Correct. And then Mr. Deegan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I was just going to I mean, I, I, I think the motion captures what we want, which is you're going to go ahead and get the community feedback. Right. We've given some comments about how we'd like the feedback clarified when it comes back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we have some understanding who's getting it. And we're going to have a conversation about what are the different thresholds and pros and cons of different types of elections, costs, etc. And at that point in time we can decide that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we decide at that point in time, we want to do some more statistically significant surveys because we're gonna go to the voters or something like that. We can do that at that point in time. Right? So I'm just wondering if we're getting wrapped up in trying to decide what type of an election when we've given'",
        "'speaker_5': 'direction to come back for that conversation in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As long as Mr. Garland has sufficient information with which to go back and put his report together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do I do want to make sure I'm following counsel's direction on this vote, which is the the fee study moves forward and in addition, these other things happen, correct? Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Yes. Got it. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was going to miss Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I was going to basically say what John said. You know, we should make that decision with all of the relevant information in front of us. So whether it's who's going to vote for this, how it's going to be structured, you know, what thresholds, you know, all that is for us to make.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, I look forward to the report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So then we have a motion it's been seconded all in favor I and he opposed any abstentions hearing then the motion carries unanimously. Thank you. Okay. That was item five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'H.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the next one pulled was five L. Correct. I know. Councilmember Vela.'",

I, I think our position on this has been that if your personal property is within that, even though it does contain a large area, I would be concerned that it doesn't reach the 25% threshold. So therefore, if you have property within that district, I would suggest that you recuse yourself on that particular item.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'A couple of reasons. One, we want to see the space. The old coffee shop may have been there for quite some time. So we ask for a simple floor plan. We don't do an inspection. It's a minor fee, I think $109 currently.'",

So after this was done, I if you're interested, there is a 50 page document that documents all of the findings that we have.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But what's important is there's an executive summary that I wrote, which is the first 12 pages, which gives you the gist of what is important to know about what we found. We were able to break it into seven different categories.'",

And then we have school based health centers that we partner with Almeida Family Services here in the district that they exist on.'",

I also presented on no cost recommendations. A lot of this work really has to do with coordinating our services and we can get a lot done with even without throwing'",
        "'speaker_6': 'money at it. There's a lot that we can do. So key findings from three tiers of support is that students, parents, staff and key stakeholders overwhelmingly reported that additional staff is needed. We need counselors. We need therapists. We need psychologists.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are inadequate to the types of services that we can provide for the needs of our students, students, staff and parents. All reported that the biggest behavioral health problem for students in their schools is depression or feeling sad, anxious and teasing in that order.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So whenever I see something come out where it's consistent across the board. So parents report it, staff report it, and students report it. That's very interesting to me. And this feeling of depression was consistent across all of the reporters, different groups.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Student groups overwhelmingly reported problems with dealing with stress and anxiety. They also reported higher uses of drug use, especially with cannabis, alcohol and vaping. For coordinated practices. What we found for the district is that our resources are woefully inadequate and at a crisis level we have more students than ever actually have our current data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As of January 2019, we had to do 44 risk assessments in high school for students who were showing suicidal ideation, 23 in middle school and 20 in elementary school for 5180 fives, meaning students who were actually taken from school.'",

In the school district, we are really working on what's called multi-tiered system of support. So being clear about what it looks like for everybody, what does everybody get when it comes to instruction and social emotional'",

What we found is that we've been building positive behaviors, intervention supports in our school staff, and it's different across sites and we need more consistency across the district around this work.

        "'speaker_6': 'Cultural responsiveness. There is a disparity regarding suspension rates in many schools, especially as it relates to African-American students and students with special needs. And when working with our student focus groups, they had a lot to say about that and what they have identified as barriers for their learning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When it came to access to the school based health center. The communication and coordination is lacking, and part of that is because of rules and laws. So we have HIPA versus for but not being able to share information back and forth between the two agencies.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Our medical numbers are going down, which means that we have still students who need the services, but they don't have the medical qualification and therefore they're not getting the services. Interesting. Just another key finding was that cell phones, students reported cell phones as being one of the biggest distractions to their learning and that as a community, we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'need to address it, that students actually want, you know, some boundaries around cell phones. So this is some of the student data that came out of the surveys. So bullying reported Alameda High School, 48.8% of students feel a lot or some students are affected.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so now, 44.5%. What I want to draw your attention to are the two bottom pieces. Drug and alcohol abuse, 86.8% of students surveyed feel a lot or some students are affected by drug and alcohol abuse. At Internet, it was 62.1%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Depression, 87.1% of the students surveyed feel a lot or some students are affected by feelings of depression. Add in Snell 64.60 4.4%. So when we're talking at Alameda High School, 87.1% of students. That is significant that the students are reporting this is a big issue, feeling worried, anxious or stressed.'",
        "'speaker_6': '92.8% of students reported that a lot or some students are affected by this, while it's now 71.6. The nice part is that when it comes to feeling unsafe, those numbers were a lot lower. Still not low enough for me, but lower.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With the California Healthy Kids Survey. So remember I said we were looking over time for patterns of chronic sadness and hopeless feelings were alarmingly high at the gray levels, ranging from 21 to 35%. And this was reporting from students starting at fifth grade through 11th grade.'",
        "'speaker_6': '14% of ninth graders and 21% of students at the continuation school seriously considered attempting suicide. So. Those numbers are alarming. For the focus groups. I sort of put a little bit of narrative around what the focus groups talked a lot about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'High school students talked a lot about cannabis on being, of course, a much bigger issue than alcohol, but also the use of Adderall. So a lot of, you know, prescribed drugs, but also over the counter drugs. They talked a lot about depression and anxiety and the stressors that are happening, you know, struggling with grades, balancing school and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'sports. What was interesting is that the consistency across the groups, around things that they were struggling with and this depression and anxiety was across all groups. And then the cannabis was across all groups with the highest sort of issues that they're struggling with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So after this was done in 1718, we formed a steering committee and we started what I hate this term, but it really is kind of a road show where getting out and getting as much information out as I possibly can to the greater community, because this is not just a school issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This really is a mental health crisis. It's happening across California, but it really is now showing itself here in Alameda, especially with students in our schools. We came up with an action plan of the things that we need to do to start implementing as soon as possible this school year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it really is a three year action plan. So we have a three year action plan of what we're doing inside the school district to address these issues. We have a budget. I'm sure some of you know about our school budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some of you don't. But we, you know, are struggling. We're struggling. We want to be able to give our teachers raises. We have a limited budget and we're trying to figure out how to balance it. Currently, we have a lot of the mental health pieces not funded.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So at the tier one level, that's sort of what everybody has access to. We've funded more than the other tiers. But when it comes to funding things like muftis to support school for the first time we got four MFT is in place at $360,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This was the first time ever in a school district that we've actually had marriage family therapist working inside our school district and we're working with Alameda Family Services to bring in that support to really meet the needs that came out in the mental health needs assessment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We need at least eight FTE. We have 17 schools in our district and, you know, thinking we're splitting them around, we could probably get away with having services of eight FTE. It would be lovely if we had more intervention leads that can help find these students and connect them with the right services and also give us services'",
        "'speaker_6': 'separately for Tier three, those wraparound services. So we really feel we need social workers in the district to do some of those wraparound services. You know, as you know, we are also seeing many of our youth that, you know, are losing homes that are having to leave the cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And a lot of these pieces are, of course, all connected. And so having the help and the support of social workers to do some of that wraparound services is really important. Connect them that with the services that Alameda has in general.'",

It was I appreciate that you guys brought it to the council because it's it's something that we need to hear about. When you did your focus groups, did you have any special focus groups with any LGBTQ students?'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. Thank you. Great presentation. How is the district working with the county public health department?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with the county mental health department, most of the support that we get is for special education. Right now, my special education budget, what I pay county mental health for the total of supporting 92 students. I pay $1.2 million to county and again 92 students that $1.2 million supports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That budget is going up and up and up because county mental health. The reason why we still use county mental health is because they can bill for Medi-Cal. The county mental health charges us 10% on top of regular billing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So right now we're getting a very small amount back and that's why our budget keeps going up and up and up. So as a district, I really am actually looking for how we can do this differently, because as our Medi-Cal numbers go down, county mental health is really not going to work because we won't be able to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'sustain this increase in budget that's continuing. So it's it's it's been difficult with them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you think that there is a role? We're on a limb on this one. Is there a role for a conversation with the school district in the city to try to approach and to try to talk to the county about how we can work differently?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I do think that there is definitely a role with that. I think that there are other grants also that county mental health can get most of the grant money goes to states and unfortunately to cities that have more medical eligible students.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there has to be this with the increase in mental illness. And I really say that there there's there's there's a mental health, but this is mental illness. So when we have students that are having suicidal ideation at this amount that we're saying we have to address it holistically and not just as Alameda, but what are'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we seeing across the county and how can we share services in a better way? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Avila.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In terms of these are our numbers, how are we comparing when we're compared with other communities? Are other communities experiencing similar issues or have they seen similar trends? Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I work with many other school districts. They haven't done many other school districts that have not done this intense level of needs assessment. If you look at the California Healthy Kids surveys, then yes, I would say that, you know, we're seeing the increase, but there hasn't been this in-depth work that has been done in some of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the other districts. So there is we don't have the same comparison. But anecdotally, I would say, you know, what is being reported is that everyone is seeing an increase in suicidal ideation. I think that we had new legislation that came out that every school district has to have a a plan for suicide prevention.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that has made districts track things a little bit better. But, yes, we're seeing it across the board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then with the school based, based health centers. I know that. And we struggled. I used to be on the board for all media, family services. Things that we struggled with was meeting the needs of the students, because one of the things that we hated seeing was any student being turned away, right when students are coming to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'ask for help. I know that the the waitlists have kind of continued to grow over the years, and that was a trend that we noticed a while ago. How are we going about addressing the students that are coming, that are sitting on a waitlist is the right way for those school based health centers to make other referrals'",
        "'speaker_8': ', to give the students other opportunities or access to aid I know for, but it makes it very difficult. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Kayla Jenks and I work very, very closely together and we actually just hired a new director for Alameda Family Services. And so I'm excited to work with Kathryn to sort of address some of these issues. Kayla and I, however, have that's part of the reason why I have used Cal through consulting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I pay Alameda Family Services a good amount of money so that we can sort of cross our services together. So if there's a student who is non-medical, who is sitting on a waitlist, he at least can communicate to the person who's coming out of my funding to sort of take them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's it's just still not enough. You know, I'm supporting for MF TS and they're throughout the district. So that that was our first attempt of trying to to to blend services a little bit without crossing financial lines too badly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And do we know how long the waitlist is?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what we are seeing is that and this is sort of comes to the next piece around the need for stigma reduction. So we are saying that. If we know that a student is really at harm, I don't mean a Family Services is taking him.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're still seeing him if they're showing that they need, you know, support right then and there. If we find out that they have a they have insurance. We're trying to work with them in the family to get them seen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many of our students have Kaiser.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the issue. Yes, Kaiser has a wait time, too. But the other issue is that families have this stigma attached to it and don't want the school knowing if something is happening because it's linked to, you know, college admission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They think that all of these things are linked and so they want to separate it. And so that's part of the stigma that we're running into about getting kids services.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I also noted the the portion or the focus that has been placed also on cultural sensitivity. What are we doing to work with that in terms of the in the classroom atmosphere around that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we have started on a three year professional cycle, professional development cycle for our teachers. The first piece is around restorative practices, so implementing restorative practices across school sites. The second piece is anti-bias work, and then the third piece is called Universal Design for Learning, where it really is about helping all students access curriculum.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that's sort of the foundational work that we've started across the next three years. And then offshoots of that work are trauma informed practices and then specific specific strategies within cultural relevant pedagogy. So that's that's the work that's happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Any of our staff taking the Harvard implicit bias test or anything like that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not that I know of. Okay. Not that I know of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to say that we have said the the three chairs of the Alameda Collaborative, Young Children, Youth and Families, our county supervisor, Wilma Chan, said We are in contact with the county school board president Mia Bond and myself, and we just had our chairs planning meeting for our meeting next April.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what Supervisor Chan has done is she has within her office access to it's a public relations consulting firm and she has generally given us an hour of their time for a conference call to help plan a messaging strategy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And she just added another hour. And so there's a subcommittee working on that when they come back to us and we'll expect to report at the meeting later this month. I'm going blank on the day. I think we may have some better ideas for how the city might be able to help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what we did talk about just on this Monday last year is that it is important to destigmatize, seeking help for mental health issues and things like, you know, recognizing warning signs. And I know this surprised me, I guess, because my kids are now 27.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been a while. But you need to look for these signs even in preschoolers and you know that that young and but and then of course the cultural sensitivities and what a taboo subject seeking help for mental health is in some cultural ethnic, racial populations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so to the extent possible, at the very least, I would like to suggest that the council directed staff to work with the collaborative on children, youth and families and also to help in ways we can with the public awareness campaign.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The idea was to reach out not only to the young people. That's certainly important to the students, but also their parents and their caregivers and and places where you would find children. So the libraries, park and recreation and camp programs, there were preschools.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, you know, social media is one way to get the word out. I know when it comes to young people, they communicate on, you know, Instagram or whatever, whatever platform they're on. But there are some ways that the city can can pitch in and help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So after this next conference call among the subcommittee who's working on strategizing the best, most effective means of messaging, we'll have a little better idea. I don't even think it necessarily costs a lot of money, but we just want to be, you know, targeted and effective.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that would be my recommendation. And I'm happy to hear from my colleagues about direction we might want to give to Staff Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm supportive of that. I also think that there's a lot of parents that participate in families that participate in our rec and park program, not to put more on our RICKENBACH program, but I think also integrating how we communicate with our rec and park staff that that work with these families or see how we can get the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'information out. I know one of the things that we get from the city that at least in my household we always save is the rec and park guide. And if we can, in the next version that we put out, include the kind of the advertising materials or the get the information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Out, whatever comes out of this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. Any other thoughts? Councilmember de SA.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you. Thank you very much for the presentation. I was very struck how perhaps almost nine out of ten youth at Alameda High were reflecting a certain concern on two variables. Right. And and and and now it was almost two out of three, which is still also a really high threshold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think numbers, especially the nine out of ten numbers, really forces Alameda City Hall to kind of move outside of the of its usual things that it does. So I you know, I am very supportive of whatever we can do to help out because when I see numbers like nine out of ten reflecting a certain concern'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to me that they have rings, certain alarm bells and and the better that we can play a role in assisting the school district and the county in in lowering that number and even lowering the two thirds number. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so now I think all of our community were well, will certainly appreciate what efforts that we can lend to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, just a second of what everyone said. I mean it. There's ways the city can be helpful. Mm hmm. I mean, even if it means I. If there's some legal way we can, you know, help with funding, I'd be open to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To hearing what those opportunities are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Vice Mayor? Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I was going to say the same thing that councilmember already said, but I also, whether it's to the youth collaborative or whatnot, I think that the more that we can engage the county in developing a messaging, the messages that are going to work in Alameda are going to work in San Leandro, etc. and the more that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we can, that messaging can be very expensive to be done right. And we should not have 13 school districts all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Developing to do it all.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, right. So the more that we can can do that as a collaborative and then use our various voices to amplify that, we'll be more successful. So anything we can do to help on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So anything further to add. Okay. So thank you so much. As a for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Giving, I have to give a shout out to the park and RECs program and we are also are joining forces. I'm going to be doing restorative practices, professional development for all of our parks and RECs, new staff in in June.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm excited to have that coordinated coordination as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for helping confirm what we know that we have an outstanding recreation Parks Department. Okay. So thank you all for your attention to that council. Do we want to quick?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We are going to take a five minute break. We are gonna give you until nine. Ten. That's 8 minutes. Don't squander it. It's never five. Because I see everyone back at 910.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I knew it before. Yeah, yeah. I love it, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me jinxed it. Guess. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So we are on to item six B, is that correct? Correct.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'Evening.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. Andrew Thomas, Planning Director. I am going to present tonight our annual report on the general plan and housing element, as well as your transportation choices and these these annual reports which were reviewed by your Transportation Commission and your planning board in February and their recommendations on the on on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'these two separate annual reports are included in your packet. These are annual reports. They're an opportunity they're important for our planning efforts, both in land use and transportation. It's an opportunity for the community and the council to sort of check on our progress, look at what we've done over the past year, but probably even more importantly, to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'talk about what we need to focus on in the future for the benefit for the public. I know the council knows this, but it's all about setting priorities. Your last couple items, you discussed this, you know, limited resources, limited, whether it's staffing or financial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Lots of needs, lots of desires. So it's all about really making sure that on all of these issues that we, the council and the staff and the community as much as possible, we're all sort of on the same page pushing on this, on the right projects, the right priorities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this is really an opportunity to have those that kind of discussion on an annual basis. We don't need any sort of formal approval tonight. Tonight is not about like, okay, we're done. We're finished. It's really about an opportunity for the council to to to review our recommended priorities and and give us adjustments.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Give us your thoughts, your ideas. This will then influence other documents and other projects. In a few months, you'll be looking at your two year budget. This is this is an opportunity for you to sort of adjust some of the priorities, which would then you might see adjusted in your two year budget.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's a chance for us to get some feedback from you on at a very sort of a 30,000 foot level. It you might tonight indicate to us, hey, these are some there's a lot of information in these reports you might tonight direct us to to schedule a future meeting with the council, a workshop on a particular'",
        "'speaker_11': 'initiative or a particular project that you feel really needs a lot more discussion because there's a lot of material on these reports that we don't there's not enough time tonight to talk about every single project in depth. So if that's something that's interest, it's important to you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please let us know. You know, obviously your thoughts and your comments will influence how we talk to the boards and commissions about these various issues. So it's very helpful to know really and make sure that we're on the same page with you as to what your priorities are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then, of course, on a daily basis, we're working with other agencies, our transportation partners in the region, other jurisdictions, our neighbors in Oakland. So it's just it will influence how we how we do our jobs as staff at all sorts of levels.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let's start with the general planning report, as you know. But for the benefit of the public, we have a general plan. It's required by state law. It needs to be up to date. It needs to be internally consistent.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The last comprehensive update of the general plan was in 1990. You have been busy, though, in the last few the last 20 years you've dealt you've created a number of new elements which were required by the departure of the Navy.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You did your northern waterfront element. You've updated your transportation element, your housing element a few times. We have a brand new safety and noise element that you just finished a couple of years ago. But there are four elements that have not gotten a comprehensive update essentially in 20, 29 years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's time it's so really the priorities are we need to tackle a comprehensive update of our land use element. It is just there are portions of it this are badly out of date. The other thing that we need to keep checking and making sure that all these elements are internally consistent as part of the land use'",
        "'speaker_11': 'element, one of the big priorities is the climate change update. This is, you know, in 1989 when the last general plan. Was comprehensively updated. You know, the concept of climate change and sea level rise just did not enter the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It has entered into your general plan through your safety and noise element two years ago. But now it's time to start integrating this in a much more comprehensive way and making sure, because you've got your climate action plan coming to you in the upcoming months and will be really a big part of the community discussion over the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'next couple of months. And of course, your most recent resolution declaring an emergency on this. This is it's very important that we have your general plans sinking up with your climate action plan. Obviously, our parks and open space elements need to be updated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is something else that we think we can get done in the next two year cycle. And then, of course, just making sure we have an internal update of the entire document. This is a this is a big workload.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we think with the with with the help of the community and the planning board, we can get these elements moving through in a series for your final review and approval during the next two year period with the with the priority being the climate change update and the land use element followed by open space and parks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let's move to the housing element. This is also an annual report required by state law. We do this every year with the council. It's an opportunity to check in on where we're at as a community, on our housing element.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our housing element, as you will remember, is we updated every eight years. We updated every eight years in response to a state requirement to show the state how we're going to accommodate what's called our regional housing needs allocation or arena, which is the term often referred to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are right smack in the middle of our eight year period right now. So we're in the 2014 through 2023 period. We have done eight years. Our arena, just to remind everybody, is 1723 new housing units. What's interesting about the arena is that it has it, and this is not surprising if you think about it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes, there's a need for 1723 more housing units in Alameda, but a large proportion, over 50%, if you just look at need, is in the you know, the affordable categories, the very low, the low, the moderate categories. So there's a within that larger regional need, there's a a really large percentage of it is at the lower level'",
        "'speaker_11': 'affordability. So halfway through, we have issued building permits for over 600 units. That's about 35%. So it looks like we're lagging if you want. If we were going to spread this out over the eight year period, we would, you know, we want to be further along more like eight, 900 units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But there is a couple projects, one in particular, the Del Monte project that we approved four years ago, if that project had been built on a was had been under construction and built, as we anticipated four or five years ago, we would actually be ahead of schedule.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what's interesting about Alameda, because we tend to have fewer projects, but they are larger projects. One or two get delayed and it starts to really sort of throw off our numbers. In terms of 2018. Last year it was a very good year for housing in Alameda with the two big projects of animal terminals and Alameda Marina'",
        "'speaker_11': '. We entitled 1500 housing units. We won't see those units necessarily. In fact, we definitely will not see them all built during this cycle. But that's going to make a big difference on the next cycle. So, you know, as the council knows, but I think we people in the community sort of forget when we have these hearings, the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'planning board do, oh, 600 units, people sort of think like we're going to approve them at the planning board, and then two days later, they're all going to be there. I mean, the units that we're building, the 600, most of those are at Alameda Landing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We approved that project originally in 2006, but they're finally getting built and occupied now. So there's a real lag on this. In 2018, we issued 181 building permits, so we're slowly chugging away. I think with the entitlements that we have approved over the last four years, it looks like we will hit our 1723 building permits over the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'eight years. I you know, we'll see. There's a lot of things that are out of our control that obviously the regional and local economy is a big part of whether we'll make that going. Well, we've certainly entitled enough units to get there, but the state tracks building permits.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we really need to think about building permits in terms of whether we're going to meet our goal, what we're probably not going to. In fact, we will most likely definitely not meet. It is with even though we may get 1723 new building permits, we're not going to have 56% of those in the low income categories, as'",
        "'speaker_11': 'you know. But for the benefit of the public, we require that every project provide 15% affordable housing. So at that rate, we're obviously not going to get to to 56%. We do have the benefit of a very active local housing authority, and their projects are 100% affordable.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's going to help. But the real message here is we've got to keep approving these projects and we have to keep working on looking at ways that we can incentivize encourage more units in the affordable categories. So looking at this, your planning board priorities, which are reflective, of course, of staff's priorities as well, and very similar'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to the priorities that we discussed a year ago. Keep expediting the review, especially of affordable housing. Move those projects through our process as fast as possible and encourage them. Number two and the planning board spend a lot of time talking about this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need to keep looking at our zoning codes. It's not and our fee structures. What can we do to. What little things can we do? Or big things to really encourage affordable housing, workforce housing, affordable by design housing, really sort of broadness.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there was the staff report that was in the packet wasn't as clear about this as it should have been. And the planning board sort of reminded me at the last meeting, no, it wasn't just the deed restricted, affordable they were talking about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was these the workforce housing, the types of things that this council has talked about in the past. For example, right now, our impact fee structure in a multifamily project, you know, our fee structure is, is if you have a very small unit, a studio, and then another unit that's four bedroom, three bath, you know, the the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'impact fee is the same. You know, that was an example of one of the things they started thinking about. Maybe we should be think rethinking that, you know, if we really want small, affordable by design units, maybe we should try to incentivize that by adjusting the fee structure or the zoning requirements.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously, number three is a big one. Transportation Committee Planning Board and Transportation Commission keep pushing this. We got to keep working on transportation to support this, you know, future housing as well as improving transportation throughout the city. We'll talk a little bit more about that in a second.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Zoning amendments to really support and our need for additional supportive housing. Homeless shelters and services. Senior assisted living projects. And one of the the we don't have good definitions of these in our zoning code we are not clear where we would like these services located or as clear as we could be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And one of the sort of concepts that have been we've been talking about at the planning board and among staff is, you know, these are always these are tough issues to talk about. It's very, very tough when you start dealing with a project in a particular neighborhood for these kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we need to start setting the standards in our codes that every neighborhood needs to do its part. It's we shouldn't be getting into a conversation of, Oh, my neighborhood's not right for this. You should make this thing go to a different neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's every neighborhood in. Alameda needs to do its share. The resolution you did earlier with the wellness center, with the church, perfect example. Every neighborhood, any church, anywhere in Alameda who wants to do that should have no question that they can do that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then, of course, objective design standards. This is something that's come up through recent changes in state law, but it's also important and supports all this. We need to make very, very clear what our expectations are for design.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need to be able to write them down, set them as measurable, objective standards. What this does is it it has the benefit for the community. Let's be clear what our expectations are. And then for when the projects come through, we don't spend a lot of time just discussing what our expectations are.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You either meet them or you don't. If you meet them, we should be able get you through this entitlement process fast. All right. Moving right along. Let's move to Transportation Choices plan annual report. This is your you adopted this plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's a comprehensive plan. Council member de SOG was the first council member many years ago to say, hey, it's time for a plan like this. And then it took us several years to get it done. But we're glad to have you back for the first annual report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You wait long and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are. I won't I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about what we accomplished in the first year. But I'm going to just jump right. To sort of. From our perspective, what are the priorities for for next year?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this is when we talk about transportation. It's resources are the issue. There is so much work, so many transportation projects. There's 39 projects and in this plan. So it's all about setting our priorities. And because there's no way we don't have the resources, we don't have, whether it's staff or financial, to do all things all at'",
        "'speaker_11': 'once. So it's very important that we as a community kind of focus on what we need to get done and then get it done and then move to the next one. So our priorities as outlined in the annual report, and I'm focusing now very much on the next two years, this is once again important.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the reason we really started talking about two years in this annual report is because we were very conscious that in a couple months you'll be looking at a new two year budget. Big priorities, ferry services. We've done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our ferry ferry ridership just continues to grow. We are going to break ground on a new third ferry terminal this year at the Seaplane Lagoon. Obviously a priority. We've got to keep doing that. It's still a lot of work to be done and we've got to get it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We got to get it opened in 2020 when the first housing opens at Alameda City. We are also working with WETA, our partner in this and with the three money to make to. Then when that opens, we will be expanding our services to San Francisco as well to Oakland in the South Bay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's a huge win for Alameda. It's where we're almost at the finish line in 2020. We can't sort of get distracted. Got to keep going on that. There's a new initiative that we're working on. And let me just preface, I said at the beginning, this is not something that just, you know, the there's two transportation planners'",
        "'speaker_11': 'helping Rochelle Wheeler myself. And then we've got our public works staff who also Scott's here and Liam's here and there and their staff. You don't have a huge Transportation Department to do all this. So these guys are doing all the work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will just interject that we have quality, if not quantity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. We're we're all worth three people. The we are just earlier this year, we started working public works and transportation planning on parking management. This is something we've talked a lot about. But, you know, charging for parking at ferry terminals, we've got of parking and we're we have our new residential moving in in Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Our transportation strategy for only two point depends very strongly on parking management. We want to. So charging for parking at ferry terminals making sure that we don't just turn Alameda point into a giant parking lot. This is a major effort.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We'll be back in July, late June, July with a comprehensive report on this, because when you start charging for parking, it means you start taking seriously enforcement of parking. And this is so you're not going to enforce your parking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The charging isn't going to work. So that's a big thing coming up. And a lot of work, bus services. We continue to work with our partnership with AC Transit and we think that that's been a very successful partnership.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need the big the big push. We've done a lot in the last couple of years with the opening of Site A at Alameda Point in early 2020. Not only do we well, we have if we do everything well, have the ferry services running.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We will also, as required by the council in the development agreements for site, a 15 minute service connecting site to downtown Oakland. So this will be the beginning of the first time in a very, very, very long time, if ever, you know, really good transit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Services from the very western edge of the island into downtown Oakland. And then, of course, we are continuing to build slowly, but we're constantly trying to build our citywide E-Z Pass program. So where have all new developments are being entered into this easy pass program?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The goal of that program, for the better, the benefit of the public is we would like to ultimately get to the point where most, if not all, of the city of Alameda is a member of our program, meaning you have a pass to get on transit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right now, that pass program is just eligible for AC transit services. The ultimate goal, if we could, you know, and this is not something we're going to accomplish in two years, but to build tours is to be able to have everybody be able to have a pass.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It gets them on ferry services, water shuttles and or busses so that, you know, we basically turn all of our residents and and employees into transit users. And then, of course, Transbay Services is something we are constantly working with AC Transit on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Alameda Residents use transit transbay services. As the council notices, those lines are often packed, people are left behind. So that argument that nobody rides busses does not hold true for Alameda. Let's just talk about the priority. So that was that was ferry service and bus services.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let's talk about estuary crossings. There we are. We continue to work on these. These are not efforts that get done in two years or one year. But they they are efforts that if we don't work on them every year, they will not happen.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's something we try to keep our eye on the ball on this. A couple of things. This has been a priority in the transportation plan for four years. None of our crossings meet what's called the Lifeline Standard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in the event of a major earthquake, we're not guaranteed that any of our busses and bridges and tubes would still be standing. We would like, as a city to get to the point where we would know with with a fair amount of certainty that at least one would be standing and usable for whether it's evacuation off'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the island or bringing of emergency services and facilities and personnel onto the island. We've been focusing on the Miller Sweeney Bridge, and that is a a listed project in the regional transportation plan. But we don't have the money yet and we don't have the plans yet, but that's the one we've been targeting.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have also been looking at how do we improve access from Alameda, specifically West Alameda, to a across the estuary to Oakland. There are several pieces to this project. One of the big piece that we've been frankly working on for too long, like 17 to 18 years, is what's called the Oakland Alameda Access Project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it deals with the connections between the tubes and the I-80 freeway that lower that lower left slide. This is an effort that we are working on fairly with the county. This is not a city project. This is a county project with Oakland and Alameda to improve the freeway access.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But what that and improve that basically automobile commute connection. But what that conversation is also really brought to the surface and is the lack of an adequate connection for bicycles and pedestrians from West Alameda to Oakland because that that that path in the tube is just completely inadequate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that is generally the conversation about a future bridge, a pedestrian bicycle bridge. We this year we came up with a conceptual design for a lift bridge. It's shown on the top, right? This would be a bicycle and pedestrian bridge crossing the estuary lift bridge from Alameda Landing to Jack London Square.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are working with the county and the region to to to get the money to do the next phase of that study, which would be a more detailed feasibility study. This is a concept plan. What we don't really understand is what it would cost to build.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Obviously, this is not something the city of Alameda could ever afford on its own. This is something that we would have to convince the region and the state is a necessary regional facility connecting Alameda to Oakland. We other thing that's interesting about this is if we're going to build something like this, which is a major structure, we'",
        "'speaker_11': 'should probably build it to a lifeline standard because it may not be adequate for everybody to drive back and forth every day on their with their cars. But in the event of a major earthquake, we would sure want that thing standing up so that emergency vehicle could get across.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, this thing is going to be about 18 feet wide. Bikes and pedestrians in an emergency, we could get an emergency vehicle across or an ambulance. This conversation is also discussed. You know, these are long that's a long term vision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's something that takes another 15, 20 years to fund and build. So we got to keep thinking about shorter term solutions. The water shuttle connection is something that we as a city continue to work on. We have been requiring every project in Alameda to build a water shuttle landing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We require every project now, I mean, to provide money for transit. The vision here is once we get enough people living on the waterfront, both on the Alameda side as well as the Oakland side, we then start have the critical mass to start funding a water shuttle operation back and forth between oakland and alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've also been talking to the oakland a's about this and the region. If they are if the region is going to start working on the freeway, which is going to affect the bike, pedestrian connections through the tubes, obviously, then maybe they need to help us fund this water shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Likewise, we've been talking to the a's and the city about and the c of almeida's letter on the a's e.r. Indicated that this is something that they should also be thinking about funding as a connection between oakland and.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'At least during game days when the congestion from the new 35,000 person stadium would further impact that interchange right at the I-80 freeway, which is already in deficiency, it's been in deficiency for 17 years. Lastly, the conversation with the A's has generated a renewed effort to look at the possibility for a gondola connection between Oakland and Alameda'",
        "'speaker_11': '. We met a week or two ago. The mayor was there with the president from the A's and they came over to talk to us a little bit more about this. And I thought it was interesting the way they describe it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They they are designing a gondola to go from BART to the new stadium at Jacqueline Square. And the way they described it is, you know, that they want to make it easy for their fans to get from BART to their new stadium.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they said told us, look, every time we show this to anybody in Oakland, whether it's the mayor of Oakland or the head of transportation in Oakland or the just folks on the street in Oakland, the very first question they ask is, well, can you extend that over to Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I thought that was interesting because if there is an opportunity to extend a gondola over to Alameda, if there's one already being built in Oakland to get to BART, that's a really intriguing opportunity for us. We have done some initial look at this and we are working with them on the next phase of this study of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'this gondola. What would it really take to extend it across the estuary in the same basic location? Connecting to Jack London. And one of the interesting things that really struck me is if we could extend it all the way to the intersection of Atlantic and Webster, which is our main sort of right to College of Alameda and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'all of our busses, sort of central west Alameda. The thing that's exciting about the gondola is if you get on there, you are at the entrance to BART in 6 minutes. I mean, it's the thing about these is they're just incredibly quick and you don't wait for a gondola.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You just walk up and the next one shows up. There's no wait time. So we don't know if it's feasible, but we're studying it and we're going to be looking at it this year with the Oakland A's. Let me just quickly move to the last few.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Last but not least, in fact, in fact, many in many ways, probably most important, the transportation choices plan talks a lot about if we really need we're really interested in trying to reduce traffic, reduce greenhouse gases in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've got to make the walking experience, the bicycling experience more pleasant and safer. People need to feel like it's easy to walk, that it's easy to bike, that it's safe for their children to walk and bike. And that's how we're going to we can make a big difference in terms of on island congestion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we're got a number of projects underway. I'm just going to name four of them. We've been the city of Alameda has been making great progress on the cross alameda trail. That's a dedicated bike pedestrian path across the entire length of the island from Alameda Point all the way to the Fruitvale Bridge and into Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The section in Alameda Point is under construction right now. Um, your public works department started construction this year on the next phase, which is Main Street all the way to Constitution. Your Parks Department finished the Jean Sweeney segment last year.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've got plans in place and funding for the next segments behind Del Monte, although there are some holdups there that we're working on, and then we've got the construction money to do the next phase, which is grand to Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Last year, the city acquired the necessary right of way from Union Pacific to get to the Tilden Bridge. We will be coming back later this year with final design concepts for the segment between Grand and Broadway. That's on Clement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that project is making great progress. We still have a ways to go. Central Avenue that the design process on that is still underway. We will be back in June with a update report on that and the request for authorization for the next phase of that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're also working to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety and car safety, frankly, on central, which is is an issue. And then Otis Drive as well as the main street section going up to the Main Street Ferry terminal. I won't talk about all these.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've got a lot going on, but all with the same goal, making these streets safer. And so the people feel more. Comfortable using alternative modes of mobility. Okay, that's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Does the Council have any clarifying questions before we go to our public comments? Okay, hearing then. Do we have public comment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have four speakers. Okay. We have Denise Trapani, Ruth Abi's, Heather Little and Pat Potter. So Denise is up first.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Honorable Mayor Ashcraft and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Council members, thanks for the opportunity to speak with you tonight. 11 years. That's how long the scientific experts at the United Nations say we have to completely redesign our carbon emitting systems. 11 years to make the changes that we need to avoid catastrophic effects of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In California, the majority of our carbon emissions are from transportation. Specifically, 40% come from light personal transportation. That's how we all get around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To put that into.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Perspective, it took us over three years to get one stop sign installed at our most dangerous intersection at Santa Clara in Sherman. And yet we're not seeing a single policy proposal in any of our plans that would change either what we're doing or, more importantly, how we're doing it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm really frustrated that we're not seeing any policy change recommendations in either the team or in the scope of work for the active transportation plan that was recently approved. There's nothing in there that says we're actually going to do anything any differently.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They have big lists of projects in there and they're great projects, but they'll be design funded and approved in exactly the same way that these projects have always been. Meaning it'll take another three years to get another stop sign installed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'By contrast, as an example, Cambridge, Massachusetts recently passed a city ordinance stating that any road improvement project would have to include a physically protected cycle track. They made this bold policy change in order to get people out of cars and to give them a safe alternative to driving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Type of leadership I would expect to see if we really think we're in a climate emergency, which we just declared. We cannot be spending years in the design and community outreach phases anymore. We have 11 years to make these massive changes and we've spent the last five years discussing whether the lives of people who are trying to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'make a difference on their own by not driving, we've been debating whether their lives are worth a few parking spaces on Central.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where is the leadership.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In holding public works accountable for the fact that we have zero consistency in how pedestrian signals work in Alameda and that we almost universally time lights and signal phases to favor cars over pedestrians? Where is the leadership and telling leader that we're not going to allow free unlimited parking at our ferry terminals anymore?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or forget wieder. Why do we still have free unlimited parking everywhere here on Sundays? Where's the leadership in telling the planning department that we're not going to approve sidewalk encroachment permits anymore? When a parklet could fill an outdoor seating need, it would show that you value public space for pedestrians over personal car.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Storage in our business districts. Where's the leadership in changing the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Policy so a private business owner can't dictate whether or not a bike rack gets installed on a public sidewalk near their business? Where's the leadership in telling the building department that we're not going to pass building inspections of retail?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Panay. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Abby.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is Abby, followed by Heather Little. Thank you. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have you. I'm on the sustain of.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sustainable Development Planning Committee of CASA. So I wanted to clarify that. And we've had Mr. Thomas come to speak to our committee and we are very thrilled to see the movement forward on the general plan and the land use plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You will have the draft climate action plan and resiliency plan before you in the next couple of months. That planning process has been a good process. It's been a public process, but it's been done without the direction and leadership of the entire council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it is the land use plan and the general plan that actually provide the policies for the city. The Climate Action Plan will identify projects and they will be great. We consider it kind of a down payment on the future, but we need a really visionary general plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Alameda is the most vulnerable city in the Bay Area to the impacts of sea level rise. And we need a visionary land use plan that takes us into consideration to the end of this century and beyond. So we very much encourage the next steps, whatever you need to do in terms of your budget process into getting those'",
        "'speaker_8': 'updates and and having a robust public process over and above the Climate Action Plan, which was great, but that was begun with the prior council. We need your direction and your leadership in this next phase of having a general plan that will reflect the vision of the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next is heavy metal products.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Good evening. Mayor Ashcraft, City Council, thank you so much for having me speak tonight. I was talking about, you know, my time coming for council and I'll talk in just a second about how it's in my mind.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been three years, three years, three years since I've been back in city and involved in all these conversations. But my God, I mean, losing to Andrew. Talk about how long it's taking to get some of these conversations and how long it will be taking to get some of these ideas to come through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It really humbles me in terms of what we are faced with and also makes me want to challenge all of you to kind of really think about the bureaucracy that's involved with some of the decision making that we're having to go through in order to get some of these actions to pass through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So with that, my comments tonight are three years ago, nearly three years ago, I came before city council. Many of you were sitting on city council when I first brought to you forward the accident that incurred with my husband, Mark, when he was run off the road on Main Street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was absolutely horrifying to me. And that meeting was a real wake up call for me to the importance about ensuring that we have safe and reliable opportunities to move around this city. And from that day forward, it really became a priority of mine to engage with all of you and with other city leadership around ensuring that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not only pedestrians, not only cyclists, and not only drivers in the city of which I am all three have safe and consistent and accessible modalities of transportation that I can choose from that also allow me to access are varied opportunities around the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But three years later we have recognized the importance of ensuring that we have those safer streets and we did adapt and believe in Vision Zero as well as the slowdown in town campaign. Three years later, we declared a climate emergency for our city in recognition of the geographic constrictions that we do have and will be facing in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the very near future and three years later. And I hear that the primary complaint throughout our city right now is issues with traffic, you know, traffic congestion. How are we going to get in and off this island? How are we going to deal with deal with it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we know that we're building more housing and I am totally in support of that. But we've got to do something and we have to be able to provide people with predictable and accessible methods of transportation and result of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm here tonight to add my voice to those who have and continue to urge you to move forward with the Transportation Commission or the transportation plan, transportation aspects that were added to the general plan 11 years ago, 11 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And yet we're still stagnant. In following through on many of those priorities, we have had enough, at least as far as I'm concerned. I've had enough with the planning, with the input, with the discussion. And to me, it's time to set forth those priorities and move forward with the goals that have been identified.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Little Pop Hunter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we have one more speaker, Lucy Julie.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Thanks very much. I would like to reiterate what everyone has been saying. We are now in a crisis. You've acknowledged it. You've done the work as far as passing unanimously the climate emergency. So that does mean that you have to change the way you do business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It doesn't make sense that these plans come up and they go through all of these. They go through the Transportation Commission and then they that meets every other month and then they get reviewed and then they come back and then they go through all of these iterations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we're in an emergency, you really do need to step it up. And hats off to Cambridge. The city council said we need to get more people on bikes. The way you do it is you provide a safe way to get around town.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's something you could do. You could just say, we need to get people on bikes. Therefore, this is what we're going to do. And you don't let it end up being a discussion with a few business owners, whether or not they like the idea or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's your job to make it happen. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker, this daly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. I'm Lucy Lee with the bike walk Alameda. I'm here to implore you to keep us moving forward with meaningful, transformative changes to our transportation system. We have plans. We've been working on plans. I've personally been working on plans for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And some of them are great. They really have good things in them. They're already there. We could implement great things with them. Dennis mentioned some of the bits and pieces of the unwritten policies that end up keeping us from making our streets safer and better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But let's just start from now implementing the policies and the plans that we already have to make our streets better.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please think. Thank you. And that was our last public speaker. Okay. We will close public comment now and let's hear council comment. And so so we structure this in the well, I mean, I'm open to suggestions. Mr. Thomas presented the general plan and the transportation annual report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we want to jump in? Talk about housing first. Talk about transportation first. Jump all over the map. What would you like to do? Councilmember by councilmember. And would you like to start? All right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In terms of the general plan. And housing. You know, one of the things that I think we we need to have more of a discussion on is when we talk about workforce housing and things like that, how much of the housing that we are entitling is really going to be to buy versus rental property?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because I think what's the missing middle is? Where is that first unit that that people can actually enter into property ownership with? And I you know, it's not lost on me that we're having a public hearing after this on our fees and our master fee schedule.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I really do think that part of how we incentivize and streamline the process is by by stop acting. We need to, as a city, I think, stop acting as this bigger way where we engage in kind of rigorous design review.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We really need to give people kind of much like we have with our different business districts, kind of here, pick from this, choose from this. And then, you know, here's your menu. As long as it's within this menu, you're good to go.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I think that if we can do that, we can kind of streamline things so that it's a more affordable process to actually allow construction to occur with still giving feedback and everything else. I just think we need to spend time on the menu and then go from there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I would like to have a conversation about how many of these units are going to be available for purchase by individuals and condo sized as opposed to, you know, this is all going to be rental property and we're basically just going to be a city that essentially, no, you can't buy here if you're in the middle'",
        "'speaker_8': 'class. I think that that's a problem in terms of the transportation choices plan, you know where to start. Okay. So we did declare Vision Zero. That was something that I was very passionate about. But I think we need to also focus on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to continue to focus on that. And part of that is the daylighting. We have, I think, just a major problem, especially on connectors, major thoroughfares and the connectors to those major thoroughfares and cut through. Sherman is one of those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There are a lot of feed in streets that go into Sherman and that and especially as we lead into Jane Sweeney and we're trying to get people to use the cross Alameda Trail, we're trying to get people to bike through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to daylight a lot of those corners. And I think that that's something that we should spend some time on and it will help. It makes driving safer. It makes our cyclists safer, and it makes our pedestrian safer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just there have been so many intersections where I've almost been run over. I've witnessed just up and down Sherman as somebody who used to live on on off of Sherman. The number of cars running through there and on to other, whether it's getting onto Buena Vista or getting on to Santa Clara or Central, it is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a major kind of access point that connects all of that. And we we really need to focus on daylighting, I think, between those streets. Sherman's one example, there are others. I just think that it would be a good use of our resources to actually focus on the daylighting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, in terms of our roads. You know, our replacement costs are quite high in terms of what we have to do and our capital costs. But again, there's a lot of things that go on our roads. And, you know, it's not just single occupancy vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's our busses. It's our city fleet and the wear and tear, it's bikes. And I think that, you know, saying that we're going to focus on ten miles. That's nice. It's a nice start from the state. I really do think that as we think about transit and how busses and and bikes are using all of these, I'",
        "'speaker_8': 'really do again think that we need to think a little bigger on that and really, you know, not just do the patchwork. We really need to think about how we're going to make sure that all of our roads and our major connectors are where we need them to be so that it's just about maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that will, in the long term, cut our costs down significantly. So just like we've done with our budget, I think we really need to think about what's the cost savings long term, if we can actually kind of think a little bigger, implement a little faster on some of that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Bike share line bike left. What next? And how do we how do we fill that need? It was a tremendously popular program and it really did help with that. First and last mile also helped it with engaging our youth and getting folks to use non single occupancy vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so how do we how do we fill that void? The gondola. You know, I'm always going to support as many crossings as we can get. And I think the future with Oakland is going to involve any crossing that doesn't involve single occupancy vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I would love to see the A's and Oakland really also embrace the bike ped crossing because that has to happen. And that's to me like the non-negotiable. We need that on on the West End. And it can't just be that that biking is for everybody that's, you know, on the east side of town.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But if you're on the West End, sorry, you get subpar conditions. And I don't think that just having a gondolas actually is going to solve that need. It's going to be cumbersome to get your. But I mean, I don't even know how that works.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know if it's ADA compliant. There's a lot of questions that I have. I just think that we we need that lifeline on the West End. And so I'm glad that they're looking at Alameda for another crossing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm going to be supportive of that. But I would also like in exchange to get their buy in on. The bike ped crossing, which we've been working on for some time. And we really do need to get serious about figuring out what the cost is going to be and then start working towards that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On the shuttle bus expansion, I hope that will look at things like the new proposed proposed. At this point, measure has passed, but connecting those areas, if we if we do have the free shuttle bus expanding, I want it to connect with places like the McKay site and some of these others, because if we're going to have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that free shuttle, it really does need to serve our community and go to sites like that. So as we look at that, I would like there to be a consideration of who are we, who are we moving, where are we moving them to, and who are the community members that are most in need where this is really'",
        "'speaker_8': 'going to make a difference for them? And I think that that's one of those sites that that we really should be looking at, as well as the new Alameda Point collaborative site. So those are those are my comments on this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we've come a long way. There's certainly a lot to celebrate in our plan. And, you know, I think we've made tremendous gains. But I also think we kind of need to continue to think about how we're going to, you know, and the reason I mentioned the road replacement plus the crossing plus the daylighting is to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'me that that hits at all the different elements of transit we're really trying to accomplish where we can get multiple that benefits. And we do have more housing coming online and we need to prepare for that. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Vela, let's just go to line, if you don't mind, Vice Mayor, next way simpler for me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you. And the housing element. You know, I would like to look at some policies. We're clearly we're clearly not reaching our affordable goals. And the reason we're not reaching an affordable goal is because we're not building enough actual market rate housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so the market rate housing that could be affordable is going to people who then fix it up and make it more expensive than it is. You know, we are going to have to and that's probably a bigger conversation for another day, have a discussion about whether we want to be in a city where we are paying'",
        "'speaker_5': ', paying for people to be able to live in homes that are affordable, or if we're going to actually start building the community in the region, that that is affordable. But one way that we can use slightly more market rate ways of doing this is to increase the availability of accessory dwelling units.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I remember when it was passed, there was this large fear that holy cow, thousands of people were going to come in and apply to put it in accessory dwelling units and now the number is 38 with 20 actually moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I know. There goes the neighborhood. I'd like to look at a way that we can use the accessory dwelling unit law to actually increase the number of accessory dwelling units, maybe by limiting the square footage so that, you know, you can currently build one unit up to 1200 square feet on certain lots.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How about if you could build two units of 600 square feet? It may actually make it so that the rent that you collect from those units could actually better cost cover the cost. So I would be really interested in looking at that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we heard at least three, if not four speakers earlier talk about climate in our climate emergency declaration. We know that one of the number one things we can do to impact climate, which has impacts on transportation and whatever else, is our land use and where we site housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our general plan and our housing element that comes out of this plan need to address that. And I will be looking for for, you know, explicitly how are we using our land use to to impact our climate, our climate impacts?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the transportation side, I want to say first, I appreciated that you pointed out we have two transportation planners and like three public works folks who, you know, I work in a transportation division that has more staff than the entire city staff of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And sometimes I have to remind myself, there's only a couple of people here working on this stuff. And they do they do huge amount of work. And I'm really very appreciative for the really good work and the mayor's comment about quality over quantity.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It definitely holds. So so thank you for that. In terms of the transportation choices plan in the next two years, I want to I would like us to really look at the fact that our transit goals are very well made, a point oriented for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're not connecting to Fruitvale, they are not connecting to BART, and they are not connecting to downtown Oakland yet. We know that is where our transportation problem is. I fear that we are allowing our development. We need to work on the Army to point stuff, but we have a development plan for Alameda Point and it has all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'sorts of measures and whatever else we need our city planning to really be transportation planning to be focusing on how to get people so they're not driving over the bridges to BART and into downtown Oakland. That's our low hanging fruit because unfortunately, when you look at the transit use in Alameda, you capture all the people who take'",
        "'speaker_5': 'BART to work for their commute. But a lot of those people are driving to BART, so we're getting counted as yay, we're great at transit, but at the same time we're having the impact of, oh, those people are all driving and and impacting our traffic.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. On the active transportation plan. It was said a couple of different ways by speakers we had tonight, but I had written down that plan needs to have a robust protected bike lane network. It cannot just be here are two more streets we are going to work on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That will be unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. We need to start moving the needle on climate and in transportation mode and we are not going to do that until people who have eight year olds are comfortable saying, Hey, go right to Jimmie's house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's two neighbors hoods over and there are there is a safe way for you to do that without me. Maybe it's 11. It's probably a little young.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I did it when I was ten.'",
        "'speaker_5': '11? Sure. I would like to see a start effect. And Daylighting is a great example. I'd like to see how we can start doing some quick and effective things. We are doing a great job of moving very expensive, very long term projects forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is not a complaint. We need to keep doing that. I'd like to see more get in the in the queue so that we have a continuous program of that. But between daylighting using cones to test ideas, etc., kind of tactical urbanism, whatever, we need to start making changes now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I sent a tweet I saw online to city staff last night that was complaining about all the parents in town who have to lock their cargo bikes up outside the martial arts studio on I believe it was Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I know this happens on Webster's where there is no place for people to park their bikes when they get to the place they are going. That is a low, quick and effective thing. So when when I see something that our one of our two year goals is to put in 50 bike lane bike bike racks citywide'",
        "'speaker_5': '. I'm like, we are not trying very hard. I know. I know where that comes from. I'm not complaining about the effort that people have put into that. We we need a goal. How do we put in a thousand bike racks in two years?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Whatever. But it's got to be meaningful. We could put ten in front of the Alameda Theater and have them packed every single night of the summer. That would be 20% of our two year goal policy that came up as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would like to see that's something we can get done. We don't have to wait for an active transportation plan for some of that. Let's get these policies done. We need to, you know, whether it's the pedestrian push button policy where we have a consistent way to prioritize the active transportation modes that our general plan says are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'our priority or whether it's the vision zero goals of actually looking at Nadeau in our lane widths and having a safe streets design as opposed to a traffic throughput design, we need to do that. The Broadway Jackson Project, I would like to ask that that come back for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that that project is not well understood. The voters were sold, that it was a multimodal project and we are spending a 75 to $90 million on what is eventually essentially a freeway rebuild with no true bike impacts there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I would like to see that come back so that we can actually have a conversation about, you know, kind of where does our council even stand on that project? What are the benefits and what do we really think we're getting out of that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At the end of the day, that project has to become multi-modal or it's not something we should be pushing. In my mind. The Lifeline Bridge. I think that's really important. I don't think it has to be a six lane Fruitvale Bridge rebuild like is in the county plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we could look at the $90 million for that bridge and whether or not we could use that on the bike bridge or something else. And I'd like to kind of keep that in mind. The ferries I'm all for looking at right sizing the parking and using.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Pricing to to make it work better for people who need parking. But the Harbor Bay Ferry we've been were six months in since we cut like 120 parking spaces out of the availability for that ferry. And in that time, six months, we have had four months where ridership month over month was less than the month before it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was. The ridership is continuing to grow. It is we do not have a parking problem. We have a people not not walking and biking to the ferry problem. So let's use let's not spend a lot of staff time trying to figure out how to build more parking at ferries that are having growing growth without with with the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'parking that we have. Lastly, in my last minute, I know we do have an existential climate problem. We need to prioritize that we are the city in the Bay Area that has this problem unlike any other. The budget is where our values live.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will be looking for how we have adjusted our budget in the for the coming two years to show that these new priorities that we have said the climate declaration, the transportation that we adopted two years ago, etc., are the places that we're putting our efforts, whether that is looking for how we can increase our staff from'",
        "'speaker_5': '2 to 3 to get the projects we are saying are our priorities done or whether that is how are we using our road, road paving program to highlight places that bike lanes and additional benefits there? You know, I really want to see this budget document as a as a as a statement of values for our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's a great plan. Hopefully. That was helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember de SAG. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Let me begin by restating something that resident Ruth Abby said, because I think it's it's important. Is she to summarize what she said, she said, we need a visionary general plan that takes us to the end of the century and even beyond, and one that involves a robust public process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I definitely want to second that. I do think that we need a visionary general plan update that is done comprehensively along to two axes axis. The first axis would be one where we are, in addition to updating the 1990 elements that we are also taking a look at the transportation even though was done in 2008.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we also have to take a look at especially the circulation aspect to the transportation element. And I think we have to update our general plan in a comprehensive manner connecting the different chapters. And this would also apply to the housing element in terms of the type of housing that that we really want to begin to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'create policies around. So I think that's why we need to look at updating not just the 1990 chapters, but also current and up to date ones like the 2008 transportation. And also we're looking at the housing element. For me, what's driving a desire to update the general plan in a comprehensive manner are a variety of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One, we take a look at what's happened at the Harbor Bay Business Park, where recently the development agreement is. If I read that letter right, the development agreement is now expired. And what that tells me then is, you know, do we really want 100 feet buildings as a right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And given the concern expressed by Harbor Bay residents about, you know, you know, a five story building, certainly that wasn't 100 feet but is still five stories. I think this is a rare opportunity for us to begin to take a look at not just land use is at the Harbor Bay Business Park but throughout Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we look at, for example, Sacramento, which is issuing a lot of rules that are almost superseding local control when it comes to building residential in neighborhoods, I think as a charter city, we can begin to work within the context that that that Sacramento says, you know, how much building that you should create, how many accessory dwellings'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you should do you know how much buildings should be done along transit corridors? Because we might one day have a part line. We can head that off the past by having a general plan that begins to address those issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So and then the other thing that's kind of driving my desire to look at a general plan update in a comprehensive manner, looking at the linking up the different chapters is, frankly speaking, when I look at the major bike pedestrian projects that are coming down Otis Drive or it's in Central Avenue, I get where people are coming'",
        "'speaker_4': 'from with regard to that. But to me there seems to be an inconsistency between the circulation and the designations of some of these uses. And I think to the extent that we hammer out, you know, what it is that we really want on these routes or even on any other routes, then I think the specific projects like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an Incidental Avenue, uh, or, or the Otis Drive projects, I think that they become more coherent. Now, the second axes by which I believe the general plan update process should be done comprehensively is one. Again, going back to Ruth Abbey's statement, one involving many residents in the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like a blue ribbon commission, we might reach out to the League of Women Voters. We might reach out to Alameda Citizens Task Force. We might reach out to to the realtor groups. We might reach out to the renter organizations in town to help us in putting together some kind of blue ribbon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because for many counties and cities, when they update their general plan, it is done in a comprehensive manner. And frankly, it does cost a lot of money. I have no doubt about that. So I will argue that that we ought to have another workshop on this just on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, finally, in terms of the Transportation Choices plan, I'm very excited about what was before us. I want to I want to second the priorities that that were were reviewed this evening as well as in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to say, in terms of the transportation choices plan, the point of the transportation choices plan was actually implementation. So that's why we have projects in there. So the point is that as as we're as a city, as city officials were beginning work, beginning to tell staff where we want you to place your limited number'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of staff persons in terms of which projects should move forward. So for those residents here or on the air, on television, when they hear the transportation choices plan, it's not just another plan. It is actually an inflammation implementation document.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I really appreciate that moving along. I really appreciate the fact that we're doing this check in. I am excited about the the Oakland A's gondola idea. I would just, you know, make sure to I would caution us to be careful as we move along because it might not just be about a gondola, could be about something'",
        "'speaker_4': 'else. And we need to be very careful as as we move that. But I think if we if we do everything right, I think a lot of people could come out winners. But but but there are some issues that we definitely need to look at when it comes to the gondola.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm very hopeful about tonight. And I just want to add one more thing about going back to the general plan update process, why it should be done comprehensively. For example, one of the chapters that is out of date is the Parks and Open Space chapter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, as we do, as we link up the Parks and Open Space chapter and do that in connection with, say, our land use, one of the policies that could come out of, you know, the public process for the Parks and Open Space chapter could be that, you know, because every park basically has a side, a road'",
        "'speaker_4': 'right next to it. We could put potentially one of the policies that could potentially come out could be in encouraging, you know, electric for electric cars and prioritizing cars that make a commitment to multi, you know, multi occupancy ridership.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's, you know, something to think about, especially in terms of dealing with the climate action issues. So so that's my $0.02 is comprehensively update the general plan along two axes involving most if not all the chapters and also involving a robust public engagement process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to have further discussions on that obviously, and also to encourage us in moving forward in the transportation choices, priorities that were discussed tonight and also keeping an eye on the gondola.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai, Councilmember Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you for your presentation. I mean, I do think in you we do have a visionary person. So I put a lot of faith in you and your ability to to get things done. I'm not going to use my whole 9 minutes because I think my colleagues have said a lot of things that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'are important to me. I do share the frustration of some of the public comments. You know, I think and you're not you and I met a couple of weeks ago when we plotted out, like I still have the piece of paper, you know, the 3000 or so units that we've entitled in the four and a half years'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've been here and we have, what, 50, 60 built? So it's it's completely frustrating to me. You know, I don't mind taking the political hit for proving housing, but I'd like to see the benefit of it at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. And, you know, just for me personally, I'm sure I mean, I'm sure everyone a lot of people are in the same boat. I'm starting to look in the market and there's just not a lot there. And then you look at a condo that's two bedrooms and a laundry, 550,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then you see that it it sells for 610 or six, 20, you know, ten, 12% over over list price. And, you know, there's just not enough supply. And if we're going to look at our general plan, which I'm perfectly fine, you know, looking at, I don't think it should be bogged down in a process that takes'",
        "'speaker_7': 'forever, because it's just frustrating to me that things just get bogged down and they take forever. I do think we have to start thinking we're running out of horizontal space. We need to think vertically. And I think that's where we're going to be going in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, I worked in Sacramento for a while, so I understand a little bit of what's going on there. But, you know, cities have abdicated their responsibility to provide housing. You know, we've had a chance. And instead of providing it, most cities try to find ways to stop it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I understand why Sacramento is doing what they're doing, because nobody else wants to do that. So they have to step in and say, okay, we're giving you a chance to self regulate and you're failing. So now we have to tell you what to do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, I mean, I think the way we can avoid that is to build more housing and we have to do that. You know, just seeing 15, 16, you know, housing units on the market, you know, it's incredibly frustrating if you're, you know, trying to buy a place to live.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And as the vice mayor said, you know, a lot of these units, you know, we should be giving or we should have market rate. So our lower cost housing is not inflated in price. So I think that's something we have to do a better job of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And if we can find ways to streamline improvement or approval, streamline the issuance of permits, get get shovels in the ground and get things built and get our people housed. I'm more I'm in favor of all of those on transit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I appreciate all the comments there, too, as well. You know, just a personal anecdote. I had this this whole issue with, you know, being able to see people intersections. I just got hit the other day at Franklin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I slowed down because I remember when I was walking precincts, I almost got hit in that crosswalk. So I slowed down in case somebody was in the crosswalk. But the guy coming out on through didn't see me and he almost barrel into me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if I didn't slow down because I was afraid of hitting somebody, he would have hit me. So those are things I think that media, a customer constant, L.A. brought those up. I think that's something super critical. And again, the frustration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of the public comments. This Central Avenue bike lanes should have been done months ago. I mean, we gave direction. It kept coming back. It kept coming back. We gave direction to staff to go do the safest way possible and get it implemented.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And now it's still going round and round with people. I mean, we need to do a better job as a council. I totally agree with with the public comments. We need a better job as council setting policy and not letting things drag.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, with all due respect to the vice mayor and Broadway. Jackson, 19 years and I'm not interested in bringing something back that's been debated for 19 years. Things just need to get done. And I share everyone's frustration with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I don't really talk too much about specific projects. I mean, the good news is the lawsuit on our M three got thrown out and they're not going to appeal it and challenge it so we can access that money for ferries.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think it was a $300 million over the course of erm three, four ferries. I think that's exciting. That's the to me the way of the future, the cross Alameda shuttle that the business groups have been pushing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I was glad to see that on there. You know, we have to do we have to do this cross this, this extra crossing faster. You know, it's already languished. You know, I just frustrated that I share the frustration with people that, you know, these things just languish.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And with all due respect to a robust community process, I mean, that's part of the reason why some of these things languish, is we try to make everyone happy and we're never going to do it. And we were elected, I think, to make these decisions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have super competent staff. Again, I think you're very visionary, Andrew. If any more people to get these things done, ask us for more people. I think that's something we would be I just I would be open to I want to speak for my colleagues, but we need to start getting things done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I share the frustration. And, you know, I hope that and I ask the public, tell us what you think we could do better. I mean, if we're not setting the right policy, if we needed to do something like they're doing in Cambridge, we need to do more of the things like we did with the climate action'",
        "'speaker_7': 'emergency. You know, tell us what what we could do better to help you, you know, accomplish what you what you, what you're frustrated with. So I'm excited. But I also share your frustration. And I just want to see things, you know, get moving.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Del Monte first vote on council was to try to overturn that. Five years ago it didn't pass, but it's still stuck. Nothing's happened. So I wish we can get off the dime and get things done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Otis. So these are exciting topics and I think we have a, um, energetic new council that's going to get some things done along with our outstanding staff. So it is my privilege to be one of two mayors who represents Alameda County on the Legislative Policy Committee of the CASA Compact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have a very aggressive meeting schedule of once a week in San Francisco. And yes, I get there by public transit. And the kinds of compact is 15 very robust mandates policies to achieve three goals to protect produce and preserve protect is to protect residents mainly tenants to produce more housing because we're seriously under housed as'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a state and preserve is to preserve the existing housing we have because much of our housing and certainly in Alameda our rental housing stock especially is very old. So what we're doing because there are more than 200 pieces of legislation involving housing that are going through the legislature, although that is being that number is being winnowed down'",
        "'speaker_0': '. But each week we have a particular theme that we cover. I don't even know it, this week's theme as we usually get it the night before. And then I have to read through all these bill summaries. But last week we did protections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So tenant protections and there is some exciting legislation even looking at bringing back a form of Costa Hawkins or getting rid of Costa Hawkins, I'm not sure what that is, but we spent a large part of the session last time on Adus accessory dwelling units, so I know all of the ADU bills have moved out of their'",
        "'speaker_0': 'committees and on to Appropriations and I'm not sure what, you know, this week's, you know, horse trading yielded, but some of the things that are being proposed in these various pieces of legislation is not to require that the resident of the main House, if you will, because they need an accessory dwelling unit as a usually unit behind'",
        "'speaker_0': 'or in the basement or, you know, converted garage, not to require ownership. That did raise some concerns because people talked about it changing the character of neighborhoods you always have to be careful about. So what if people buy these?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Or rent them but then turn them into Airbnbs and so and I think we have a um. Well now I'm getting ahead of myself. Um, but I will a little spoiler alert. Our new city attorney who starts next month comes to us from the city of Santa monica, where they have implemented some, some ordinances to protect'",
        "'speaker_0': 'from just that sort of thing. Um, but as something that I think is exciting is, and I actually brought this up in the committee is that we're looking at, we're seeing more prefabricated housing being used for aid use and prefab housing has come a long way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It used to have sort of a a stigma attached to it. But you should see some of these units if you haven't already, they are easy to put up. There is much less impactful on a neighborhood where an aid was going in and the building trades have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They've pivoted and they understand that, yeah, there's a new way of building residential units and they have training facilities and they're learning how to do this. So this is a way that we and in Alameda, we were a little ahead of the curve because we did our ADU ordinance, but they're mostly the complies with all the new'",
        "'speaker_0': 'state law coming. And one of the things was brought up by some of my colleagues that there's so much bureaucracy and that adds to the cost of a project and therefore stifles housing production. There is pending legislation or proposed legislation that would limit how many hearings a project could go through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A city could have, you know, maybe three. And then that's it. It's either it moves forward or, you know, you're done with your housing, with your hearings. After that, the and I will just say that the county of San Mateo, um, one of their, their representative mentioned take a look at the county's website.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They have a housing department and it is a very user friendly website. Take a look, Alameda, folks, and see if there's some things we could we could emulate. The and so what we're looking at when we look at this proposed legislation is the you know, how does it meet the three goals of protection, production and preservation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Also, how does the legislation impact the jobs housing balance? Because that's something communities are struggling with. We tend to be, um, I think we're a more housing rich community than we are jobs rich and we are trying to achieve that balance and certainly the financial impact.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We don't need more unfunded mandates. We've also told our the representatives, the committee chairs and MTC in a bag that we want to see more carrots and fewer sticks. For those of us who are doing quite a bit, we want the to have best practices rewarded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was a piece of legislation proposed, but it's been pulled that would have taken away transportation funding, SB one funding, if you didn't meet your production numbers. And, you know, we don't have a lot of control over what gets produced.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But anyway, this is an ongoing process. We're working along with the budget process, to get our recommendations in and hopefully impact some of the legislation. Okay. Quickly, in my 3 minutes, I'm just going to go through. Okay, the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think that what can help Alameda and other cities is we are looking at some infusion of state funds and that's even beyond I think it was perhaps one and two that we passed last year. The governor has added 500 million and it doesn't sound like a lot, but he's added that toward affordable housing and I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'think more is on the way. Okay. I'm jumping over to transportation because I talked a lot about housing with the cost of compact. Yeah. Line bikes pulled out. I know. Dockless bike share seems to be a challenge. I would love for a staff to look for another replacement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I agree with Councilmember Vella. It is a great way to get people out of cars. And to close that first last mile gap. Bus passes we talked about or the report talks about the city wide easy pass program at a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I can't remember whether it's cost compact or maybe East Bay Economic Development Alliance. They talked about how there are no I think it was cost cutting back some county I can't tell you which one in the nine Bay Area counties is making sure that bus passes are made available to people like the homeless population, people who'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are, you know, very vulnerable populations. And so I know I'm sitting with two colleagues who are on the AC Transit Liaison Committee. If I don't know if that's something that AC Transit is doing or if you could bring it up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that that's important just to give people that access to get to the services that they need. And the we do need to make our streets as pedestrian and bicycle friendly as possible. And I also agree we need to move forward on Central Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, there's there's a finite range of possibilities. Let's choose the best one and let's get going. We can't please everybody. All the merchants safety should always be our first priority. Safety of drivers and drivers last probably after pedestrians and bicyclists the Alameda shuttle exploration I'm I'm okay with that but are we duplicating AC transit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel like Alameda residents don't realize quite how extensive AC transit is. Maybe we need to do a little more public outreach on the apps that you can use to plan your route. I find them to be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do need more EV charging stations across the city. Let's do that. And the gondola to BART and the a's terminal, it's worth exploring. I mean, anything that gets people out of their cars, it's not mutually exclusive with the the bike bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't think we take anything off the table at this point. And really quickly, because I have public works and city engineer in the room, the pedestrian signals that flashing cross light on Otis Drive by Lane School have been on constantly for weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They don't go off and it's going to just make people, you know, less aware of those things. Oh, it's flashy, but no one's in that and that could be dangerous in another situation. So if you could get that fixed on anyway, let's move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's get these things done. My time's up. You are. Thanks, everybody. So, staff, you've got your your direction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're all set.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Very much. Thanks for spending this much time talking about this. It was very helpful. You'll be hearing back from us shortly and often.'"

    "Resolution to Add and Revise Planning, Building and Public Works Fees.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. And thanks for all the good work, all of you out there and staff and also the public for all your great input. Okay. We are moving on to six C.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Public hearing to consider adoption of resolution amending Master P resolution number 12191 to add new and revise existing planning, building and public works fees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're back.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm back. I'm just doing that. I'm just going to do the Vanna White portion here. This is. I'm going to Madam Chair Council. And for Thomas, what we have before you tonight is a public hearing to consider adoption of a resolution amending our master fee resolution to add new and revised planning, building and public works fees.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is a required exercise. We charge fees for services under state law. We have to check in on those fees every five years. We have to make sure in that study that we are not overcharging. This is a fee for service.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not a fee to make money. It's a fee to cover the costs of providing a service to people who need permits under either local or state law to make improvements to their property. We also want to check to make sure we're not under charging under council.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Council policy is to make sure that we are getting cost recovery. So if somebody needs a service, they need to come to city hall to get a permit or a service. We need to make sure that we are accurately charging them for the cost of that service so that the general fund or that other residents of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'city through their general fund are not sort of subsidizing those costs for them. So that's what we're doing. We're checking to make sure that our fees are accurate. And once again, these are fees are not designed to make the city money.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These are just to cover the cost of a service. We did this this we do this every five years this year. We did it in partnership with public works. So what you have is planning building, which is the planning building and Transportation Department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we also did it joined forces with public works because they needed to update their fees as well. This was an important exercise because there's really probably no two departments in Alameda that work more closely together. I mean, most projects and any projects of any size require permits from both planning, building and public works.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we want to make that process as seamless as possible for the for the customer. And so we also tried to sort of make sure that our fee structure works well together. Something else that I know this is important to the council and something we were working on constantly and also causes the need for adjustments in fees'",
        "'speaker_11': '. We're constantly working on efficiencies. How do we make our processes more streamlined? How do we make it more efficient? This reduces the cost of the fees. It also just makes us all much more productive and makes the experience for the customer just much better.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And you know, it's good for both the city. We meant spend less staff time processing permits and it's good for the customer. They they get their permits faster and they spend less, less to get them. I'm going to now turn this over to Greg McFadden, our building official, who has been here even longer than I have and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'has been through this process, I think four times. He's going to talk a little bit about the planning and building changes. And then Scott Wickstrom, your capable city engineer, is going to come up and take us. There is take a couple of minutes to talk about the public works fees and what's changed there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're all available to answer questions if you have any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas again.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Gaming getting fancy building official quickly. The building fees were currently when we did the fee study and when we did the fee study, we look at all of our fees and we talk to staff and we look at how long it takes to do the process, processing the permanent, the counter inspections, the whole gamut.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's what we've been doing for the last few months, is looking at those, figuring out what it takes to do a permit and then figuring out based on that, what, what we need to charge based on, say, we've determined that the building department is currently recovering about 80% of their fees, their costs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We were charging an hourly rate of about $156. We're looking at charge of $200. There's not a lot of changes to the building fees that pretty say we made a few we added a couple, but not a lot of changes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The increases really for building are were to code cycles since the last fee study. One of the big changes that's come into play is the green building code, which has added quite a bit of new requirements on both residential commercial buildings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's more time involved in inspections and planning check and and staff cost increase over five years. So that's where you get the increase in the building code planning has gone from a 60% cost covering up 200%. Their hourly fee would change from $184 to $216.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And our planning has done some more or more significant changes. One of the main ones is going from more deposits to more flat fees so that there's a surety of what you're being charged when you come in for a permit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you get a deposit and it's sort of out there and you don't really know. There's a lot of staff time in tracking the time and then billing sort of flat fees. And we're able to do this by looking at what we've done over the past five years has been particularly busy the last five years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have some good numbers, so we were able to determine what those flatfish could be. So planning just got a lot more flat fees. We've done some streamlining, looked at items that we don't need to do as significant a review on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're instituting some online permitting from a building standpoint and from planning standpoint. We take a lot of plans in electronically any of the big projects we've done, all the side projects have been submitted electronically. We're not taking in the big rolls of plans until the end when we need a copy for inspectors in the staff.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we've cut down a lot on the planning. We wish we had done that with Domani because we have some enormous rolls in the vault waiting to go. But they've been there for, as you say, quite a while.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's the big changes in planning building. I'm going to turn it over to Scott.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, madam, and members of the Council. My name's Scott Wickstrom, City Engineer. I'll talk briefly about the changes to the Public Works Office. We do work closely with planning and building. However, we're quite a bit different in terms of the scope of projects that we look at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We very much are narrow to public right away and while building will issue well over 3000 permits per year, planning looks at over 500 some odd applications and various permit reviews. We have about 40 ongoing projects impact the public right away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what we're trying to do with this fee studying the changes in here is actually go the opposite direction of planning department and from a fixed fee and doing more towards hourly based. These 40 projects are really the big projects are the site there are the new warehouses out on Harbor Bay for one of the challenge projects'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and aluminum arena. It's hard to really judge what the scope of that work is going to be. The best way to accurately collect our costs is to basically come up with a fee study and then bill hourly for our efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our rate does increase from 182 to $192 per hour and following a similar methodology that the other departments were done. One thing that we are making a bit of a departure and we are looking to explicitly subsidize some permits are for encroachment permits for residential properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you have a broken flag, a concrete or a couple of broken flags concrete up front, most homeowners are find it to be very expensive to one hire the contractor. One of the things that we realize from our standpoint when we go through and also inspect that work and plan, check and go through all the reviews in'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the process because of the liability that we incur from the city, it takes a fair amount of time and effort for us to the point where that cost of our permit would be almost equal to the cost of the improvement, which means that the work gets done on Saturday or Sunday without benefit of a permit, without benefit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of inspection, and not necessarily to city standards. So we are making a move to explicitly subsidize that. It's a relatively small proportion of the amount of work that we do in a relatively small amount of year, the total cost recovery that we do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Does anyone have any questions of staff? And we have no public comments. So council discussion. Did you have a staff question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I can ask it under discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can ask it now. You're on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Site. And I spoke with the city manager about this. I well, since we're in discussion, I'll say first up, this is a great report, makes the case for how the fees that you're suggesting make sense from a cost recovery point of view.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I found missing in the report was who is being impacted by this and what is that impact? I appreciate our city engineers pointing out that the public works fees are really mostly very large projects for the most part, etc. So on the planning and building fees, can we do we have some idea of that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are everybody, right? That was what you told me earlier. But what the impact of this increase is to a a norm, you know, a homeowner who is renovating your bathroom.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Absolutely. You can sort of decipher it from the tables. But what thank you for the heads up. Greg was able to come up with sort of some simple projects, and there's a handout here that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're better deciphering than I think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we we did we put together three fairly typical projects that we see come to the counter and looked at what the current planning fee planning building fees would be and what the proposed would be. So the first one is a residential addition, 450 square feet that a $75,000 valuation design reviews required.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the current design review fee is $3,000 going forward as a flat fee, it's a 2860 filing fee goes up from 208 to 264. You can see planned check goes up, inspection goes up a bit. So the total cost goes from about 5100 to almost 50 $600.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's the impact on that type of project. Commercial tenant improvement. Nonstructural says no new structural walls 2500 square feet with a window change. So in this case we have design review exemption. It still gets looked at to make sure it's consistent with the guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But there's there's no design review process, $150,000 valuation. You can see the design review fee went up a bit. Filing stays the same as the previous example. Planned check is pretty flat and building inspection goes up about $400.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we've got about a 600, 550, $600 increase in that permit. The last one is a bigger project, new multi-family residential construction, four story 5200 square feet, $1.4 million on two acres with design review. This would be consistent with one of the buildings at BLOCK nine.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Inside a design review was a $500 fee with time and materials $184 an hour. We'd be looking to have a flat fee or a initial fee of 2868 within the time materials at $216 an hour. So the real change there is slightly larger flat fee, with an increase in the hourly cost building permit inspections go up again'",
        "'speaker_9': 'based on that and the total cost is up about $3,000. That's just an example of three that we came up with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I so first off, I mean, I asked just everybody in the business. I asked this question about 330 this year. Appreciate how quickly and how detailed you got the design review is that the from the from the looks of it it doesn't matter whether you are a residential or commercial or huge building a new thing'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The design review is 2868 flat.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. It's let me just clarify on the big project when when when there's a there's a flat and plus time in materials that's essentially a deposit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So got it. Your big project comes in, we start tracking our hours that the first minute if we if your project actually only turn takes 6 hours, well we'll take it out of the initial deposit. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. If you're just redoing some windows, but they need some sort of approval, but they don't need design review because they look just the same as the ones that are there. Do we think that this kind of 8% increase in 8 to 9% increase in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For the exemption?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm just wondering, this is a $75,000 project, but I'm sure you get a lot of just rewiring a couple of like light fixtures, kind of really small projects. Do we think that the the scale, which seems to be about 8%, is about the same for tiny project?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah the the the hourly when we looked at the these projects are small project with changes of lights. The hourly time was the same the the hourly charge went up. So that's the difference you'd see is the difference between 156 and $200 an hour would be the difference you'd see in that type of project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was like a 25% increase for those tiny. For those small. Yeah. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyone else? Yes. Councilmember Day, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you. I certainly had the same concerns about possible impacts to what I will call the smaller scale projects, particularly projects done by homeowners or property owners. In looking at the report, particularly the appendix. It seems to me a way to systematically get at that is to one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ex for me accept the modifications with regard to the planning division. Because when you look at the tables in the appendix A1, when you look at, for example, the first table and A1, the third table and A1 and the fourth table in A1, the nature of the fees that are being referred to there are largely kind of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'larger projects, the type of fees that are being discussed. The second part, the second table identifies the type of fees that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could potentially be smaller.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Projects. But by and large, I look at the type of fees that are being discussed and they're Appendix A1 Planning Division. It seems to be the larger projects. When you go into the building division though, you look at the appendices and you look at a range that I think there's fees with regard to flagpoles, for example, fees'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with regard to fences. So a lot of the fees that are associated there do seem to be kind of a smaller scale projects, but not all, because there are some fees within the building division that refer to new construction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So new construction is by and large going to be a pretty big project. But but what's also distinguished there, though, is remodeling. So. And the second thing about the fees within the building division as indicated in the front end of the staff report, but also as indicated on the on a detailed basis in the appendices, is that'",
        "'speaker_4': ', you know, the cost recovery is 80%. I mean, it's not 100%, but 80% ain't bad compared to, I say, the cost recovery of what's what's happening in public works or or in the planning division. So one thing that I would suggest is that within the building division that we might my druthers is to not just any fees'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that have a cost recovery of 78% or higher, but if there is a fee within the building division that has cost recovery of less than than 78%, you know, adjust that either to 100% or 78%, whatever. So that would be my druthers and also to to adjust anything having to do with new construction, whether new construction for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'single family homes or new construction for industrial or commercial, but for remodels of residential. I would keep at it. I would keep it a 78. I mean, because from my vantage point, an 80% cost recovery is pretty good.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just I understand, you know, sort of where you're going. A couple of things. One, just the numbers that Scott talked about. Alamy we do a few big projects a year. The lion's share of the expense that you as a city spend to process permits and the money that we bring in to cover those costs is the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'small projects. It's those small I mean, if you think about our projects, it's it's like a pyramid. There's a few big ones that we all talk about and we argue about it in public hearings. And then there's the rest of the pyramid, which is all the little ones, and that's really the bread and butter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So when you say or when you think about the option of saying, well, let's not try to get full cost recovery on the small ones, you're talking about a huge portion of the pyramid. And so what does that mean?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It means that one of the other things that the council has adopted in the past is their need, because the planning building department is completely fee based. So we're our plan and our our whole mission in life is to operate this service without having to use general fund money.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's but we also are preparing for cycles. And what happened in the recession was the cycle went down and immediately we just had to start essentially laying people off and stop doing the kinds of work that the council and the planning board still wanted us to do, like updating the general plan and doing the zoning changes and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'or doing things that would help us get out of the recession. And it got tricky. So one of the things that you've done, which is smart, is said we got to build in a rainy day fund because there are going to be cycles.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So you need to build up a reserve. So the way when we go at 80%, what you're basically saying is just eat away the reserve. I mean, that's what's going to happen if we don't get 100% cost recovery as close as possible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It means that our ability to build a reserve is going to be severely hampered because we're essentially going to be digging into the reserve to cover that extra 21% for the lion's share of the projects. And once we eat away the entire reserve, then we're going to be coming back to you basically with our out saying, hey'",
        "'speaker_11': '. We have no more reserve member reserve right now is 800, about 800,000. I mean, we'll burn through that and then it'll be like, okay, time to either raise the fees back up to get her percent or open up the general fund and start subsidizing through your general fund the services that we're providing at the counter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's the downside of not pushing to the to the, you know, up to the levels we're talking about now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just come in that I would not be able to support my colleague's proposal because I very much appreciate the work that all three of these departments did. And I do want to know that the policies we have in place, the fees were charging, have been streamlined, have been updated and modernized.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I, I think that it is entirely reasonable to have these charges. And, again, we look at all the things we want to do. In our last report, we told Andrew more than once, if you need new staff, you know, more staff, let us know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And at the same time, we would say 78% recovery is good enough. I, I think there's a lot of ways that homeowners can finance home improvements. Sometimes you take out a home equity loan, and we do know that property in this area has appreciated greatly in the last decade or so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think we do need to keep an eye on our city's budget. But we have a bit of housekeeping to do because it's 5 minutes to 11 and we need a motion and we need four votes to pass to to pass it to be able to consider new items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have the item nine, which is Councilmember de Suggs Referral Council referral, and then we have ten, which is an update on the Emma Hood streams that are items. So do I have a motion to go past 11 from the tired is looking person up here or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd make a motion I'd like the update on on my hood. I'm wondering if Councilmember Desai wouldn't mind if we could continue his item to another meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh, the only thing is this. We continued from two meetings ago.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, I'm just. I'm. My feet are swelling up. I've been sitting for a long time. I'm not feeling great, so I may leave.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, if we could do it the first part of the meeting, that would. I'd love that. I wouldn't mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, counselor, referrals have a place to go. But will. I mean, I don't know what our next agenda looks like yet, so I would certainly I want to hear your item, too, but I could.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I make a suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please? Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Could we continue to go to Monday night's meeting? Allow me to point. After we only have one conversation, which is kind of to say, because we then just quickly talk about it there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's a public meeting. The problem is, I don't think you necessarily have the kind of public access that this has tonight. It's not going to be televised, for instance, for people who aren't there. But I mean, that's certainly a suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do I have a motion to go past 11 with two items with one item, someone make a motion or no motion?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would move two items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. Can we be quick, though?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do we can we can even set a stop stop time, can't we? That we can say we're not going past 1130.'",
        "'speaker_7': '1120.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just I just I just want to flag that this one actually has some discussion that is key and timely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you think it's reasonable that we could go to 1130?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Depends how long the hotel takes longer. So it's a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Relatively.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's just a council referral or not? Yeah. Okay. So do I have a motion that we continue the meeting to 1130 to consider these two items? Okay. You're making the motion council member dated July 2nd and seconded. Okay, we have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a second on favor, I. Okay. How many eyes was that when I did?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'For medical reasons.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I got four. Okay, so let's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's let's talk fast.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'About the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Approval of this item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. This there's a motion to approve item 60. Do I have a second?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's been moved and seconded. All in favor. Hi. Oh, did Melissa just shoot? Okay. Oh. Do you want to ask what it would be?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I. Can I. What? While we were waiting for. Councilmember, could we please hear the swim center so that if she wants to leave before the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so we had a motion in a second and we were voting on approving item six. See.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like to have a discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Discussion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, you know, I think my concern is that the we just talked about the cost of use. We just talked about the cost of trying to streamline and who this who these fees get passed to. I understand that, you know, we're trying to bring some of the fees in line, but there are some fees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My concern is if our fees are too high. We've already heard from renters who've said they're afraid to report certain things. And now we're adding to the cost of that. And I think that we do have to think about where that comes from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm all for trying to get to cost recovery, but I do have a concern where inflation is, you know, half of basically what are some of our fees are and frankly, a quarter or, you know, a fifth of what some of our other fee increases are.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I do have some concerns relative to that. And I think that we're missing the mark when it comes to I think, you know, I'm for trying to streamline it and get those increases, but I think we're trying to do a lot in one cycle.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would like to know a little bit more about, you know, how we think we're going to actually go about enforcing or or getting people to comply and how we think it's going to impact things like our ADOS and stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would like to note that on the historic preservation side, you know, if you need a certificate of approval by the Historic Advisory Board, I mean, those fees are going up substantially and we already have a lot of issues.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, with with timeliness and getting that board together and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So can I just quickly. I think our recommendation is set your fees to cover your cost, however we do. And the last item with the hearing, people talk about the process to build things, the amount of time we need to discuss things.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I guess what I'm asking the council to do is you should adopt full cost recovery, but then you should also make it very clear to staff. Keep working on streamlining these processes. Move more of these projects from the design review plus time and materials to the design review exemption category.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Find ways so that you're getting full cost recovery. But the permit doesn't require a certificate of approval. With a public hearing at the Historic Advisory Board, it can be approved by staff, and that's just that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's the adjustment? What's the timeline for that? And where are we going to see those comparisons in terms of the timeline or those projects getting cut down or streamlined?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, we can I mean, we can be processing changes to these every single one of these changes is a change to the municipal code. So it's changing a process. It's cutting out a public hearing requirement. It's setting it's setting design review exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we've been doing this consistently over the last few years. We've been getting better. But if you need us to speed that up, we we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Certainly I think I could agree that we do. And I would also add that even if we don't do it, Sacramento may in the near future.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would I mean, I would just like to say that in my opinion that that needs to come with and with this ask for an increase in fees. I think that saying that we're going to come back, I would like to know when that's going to come back and when we're going to at least review it'",
        "'speaker_8': ', perhaps with staff coding some of the more major or more impactful ones. I guess that we have a lot of them. And my ask would be that we get a handful of them, you know, maybe what are the top two or three that we think could make the biggest impact?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there's some things that we can we've already been talking about in terms of prioritizing, in terms of the climate action thing, like, you know, how do you streamline, you know, energy efficiency changes, Windows, things like that. Would homeowners want to do?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think with the climate action, we'll start.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With both an eye to the timing, not wanting to keep my colleague out much later and also making sure we're staying within the parameters of the item that was was noticed before us. We do have a motion. We do have a second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. Yes, it was made and seconded. Yes, right. Yes. Okay. Okay. All in favor. I opposed. No. Okay. The motion passes 3 to 2. Thank you. Okay, now we will move on to the City Manager Communications.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the interests of time, I could move mine to the end so that you can get to the other two items. Okay. You get done by 1130.'"

    "Hotel Tax Rate Increase Proposal. (Councilmember Daysog)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Levitt. And do we have any oral communications? Not agenda? No. So then we move on to council referrals. Item nine, a couple more days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, great. Well, thank you very much. Laura, do you, by any chance have this, um.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, yes. Actually setting it up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just to get to the punchline. The punchline is, I think the city of Alameda should officially seek to increase the current hotel tax rate, which is basically 10%. The hotel tax rate is also referred to as a transient occupancy tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's basically the punchline and that's one recommendation. And the second recommendation, but these are separate is begin thinking about setting aside some of the increase in revenue generated by the increase in the rate for having an Alameda visiting serving campaign.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It could be run, for example, money generated from the increased incremental revenues perhaps could be funded through an RFP process to an outfit like the Chamber of Commerce who might serve as as the visiting center. So what I put together, I don't do this well that I put together is just a bunch of data.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is actually from this actually from 2015. So this is I know how we talked earlier this evening about the wheels of kind of moving slowly. But, you know, we're almost four years ago. So I so I think one of the points in putting this slide together, which is 2014 data, but I think the rates still'",
        "'speaker_4': 'hold is to show how low our hotel tax rate is relative to nearby areas like Emeryville, Berkeley and Oakland, which are really within our market area. The point of which is to say even if we increased the hotel tax rate, we wouldn't be putting ourselves at a competitive disadvantage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while San Leandro is a neighbor to us at 10%, if you look at the gross revenues generated by a their what, clearly the $402,000 of San Leandro versus the $1.6 million generated by Alameda to me suggests that San Leandro is a different market.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's why I believe in increasing the hotel tax rate. Somewhere north of 10% right now would not put our our motels and hotels at a competitive disadvantage. This is the hotel tax rate for the Union City. And the reason why I included this is because Union City created an interesting mechanism where when they when the voters'",
        "'speaker_4': 'adopted the increased hotel tax rate, they did it in a way that allows the city to kind of calibrated up or calibrated down depending on market conditions. So that's something to think about. This is the hotel tax rate for the city of Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're at 14% and they were previously at 13%. And you can see you can see how much they're generating. Clearly, we're not going to generate that much because we're at a different scale. So I just want to make sure to clearly see that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And one of the reasons why I think we should think about not only increasing our hotel tax rate, but doing it in a strategic manner is because I do believe that we have a variety of assets that nationally renowned entities are beginning to to recognize assets that we can market to new visitors within the region, as well'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as market to daytime visitors. People, for example, who are working, coming to our harbor Bay Isle on short contract jobs or whatever, so that they can come to Alameda. And here's an example, something that was in the Architectural Digest where Alameda is antiques by the Fair Bay was was noted in July 25.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then in in Sunset Magazine, again, Alameda, a spirits alley was given some recognition. So my hope is to increase the hotel tax rate. I don't think it will put us at a competitive disadvantage. It does require a vote of the people.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the second thing is to. Target some of that towards a visitor surfing campaign. So I would hope to have staff come back with some more thoughts on this and some recommendations and suggestions. If if the council so looks at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you remind me, colleagues, did did this come up at our priority setting? Okay. I guess we've discussed it somewhat in context of needing to do something about an a Airbnb ordinance and then making sure that our total is competitive with other cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those days are old. San Leandro is now past is there but what's the what's the the pleasure of the council and vice mayor?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in general, I support the general idea of talking about this tax at some point in time. I think we just continue to talk to things. I am concerned that a lot of times when referrals come, the way to not address them is to say, hey, let's just put them on a list to get addressed earlier, and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'then they just become a part of a long list and is difficult to do. I think we have infrastructure bonds, we have a whole bunch of things that we're going to be talking about going to the voters of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I am happy to have that commerce, this conversation as a part of what are the things we are going to ask the voters for. But quite honestly, I don't disagree with you that this is probably one that we should talk about, but I don't want to jump one to the top of the queue and then find'",
        "'speaker_5': 'out that we you know, there were other things we wish we were going in asking for funding. Funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you're saying I'm for this into a discussion of of ballot measures for the general election.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A future conversation with Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I actually think it's a bit premature. I would say let's wait until we actually have some of these hotels built that are coming in, are we? I know we have hotels currently, but in terms of the impact that something like a total increase is going to have, it's, uh, I would rather focus on the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've talked about the storm drain tonight. I just think we have a lot of other things that we're focused on. So I'm not saying no. I'm just saying no for right now. And if it's no for right now, I don't want to put it on the list for staff to to be focused on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I would like our polling to be very specific and strategic to the few measures that have already been put forward by staff and discussed by council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll just throw in that. I think the authority is probably an easier measure to pass because residents are generally speaking not going to be paying it. But I, I do have some concerns about that money not going to the general fund because that's what pains me to know that we are getting less in our Toti than'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our neighboring communities and that's just money that's not going into our general fund. So but that's a that's a discussion that could be had at the same time. Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure. I'll chime in. I mean, I think it's a good idea to think about this. Like you said, Mayor, this is not something that Alameda residents are going to pay. I'd like to I mean, I don't know whether it's put it on a list or, you know, at some point we're going to have a discussion on revenue'",
        "'speaker_7': 'measures. And this needs to we need to make sure this is their.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Time. I mean, instead of like just pushing it off and, you know, you know, this is something that was proposed four years ago. And I thought it was something that maybe should have been done already. Again, not to keep beating that horse, but I am concerned about one small thing and that's, you know, dedicating any of of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it, because I think that changes the characterization. And, you know, what the what the threshold is to get it passed. But, you know, I think this is something this is kind of a no brainer to me. You know, it's a quick and easy way to increase revenue that doesn't really come out of the pockets of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me if I quickly saying I'm I'm happy to have introduced this. I look forward to having further conversations on this. I do want to make sure to say that I project that if we increase it by one percentage point, that we would generate $160,000 in incremental revenues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if we increased it by two percentage points to 12%, we could generate roughly $250,000. And I think that would be good money that that that could go towards a visitor surfing campaign. So but I look forward to including this as part of a more robust discussion with other measures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm fine with that. I can live with it. Okay. Well, I'll find a note if it does come to a vote. I don't think it will be competitive with another vote for the reasons that we said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Okay. And have staff discretion, direction. Okay. The next item is number ten Council Communications. I'm wondering if we could take item ten a first to make sure we get that covered hearing no objection. Go ahead, Vice Mayor.'"
