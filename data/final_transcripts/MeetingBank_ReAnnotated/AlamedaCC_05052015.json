        "'speaker_5': 'But the really important fact was that what really the idea that Alameda finally embraced the idea that we needed to build housing for everybody, not just for the, you know, the top 11% who can actually afford a market rate home.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'family, a job, children in school, a whole history. And in Alameda, the idea of roots and longevity is a source of pride. Yet the wealth that's been brought by the computer industry is not all encompassing. It's very selective.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The character of to undermine local character.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unless we push for policies that ensure that this wealth also generates public benefits, including affordable housing. I am heartened by the strong support of this Council. I hope we can all work together to build affordable housing without having to rely exclusively on market rate housing.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Members of the City Council, my friend Cassidy. I live on Bay Street and I'm opposed this ordinance for several reasons. First off, I believe it's a dishonest ordinance. It's purporting to be about the safety of the food supply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yet, when Council member Odie broached this months ago, the only thing he discussed was layoffs at a particular grocery store. Secondly, it's about an imagined problem, not a real problem. There's, you know, predictions that Wal-Mart's going to be taking over grocery stores.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But are they doing that? No, it just we're just guessing that's going to be a problem. But my biggest concern is the message it gives to the business community. We have significant vacancies in office space. We have significant vacancies in retail space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We got to populate Alameda Point with tenants at some point. And here we are telling the business community that our city council will enact rules about how they can hire and fire people. It's not a real welcoming thing.'",

This this it's my understanding this is being brought to us to approve because there's a California state case that went up to the California state Supreme Court. Supporting the proposition that it is to provide safe food supply to our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I and I don't want to speak for the other council members, but we have had discussion about that and. And in the end, it only applies to stores that are over 15,000 square feet. Groceries as a high percentage of the store has to have food items.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Sounds really loud from my point of view. I want to thank all of you that came to our volunteer recognition dinner a couple of weeks, lunch a couple of weeks ago. It was a very special event. More than 280 volunteers were recognized for thousands of hours, as you'll be hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it was particularly warming to have them new members, particularly new members and a couple of the older members of council there. So thank you for doing that. The mission of the Mastic Senior Center is to provide a well-rounded education, social and recreation program for adults 50 years of age and older.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So 50 years of age and older. Remember our vision statement is that the mastic? I see the look on your face. Mastic Senior Center's vision is to offer a variety of quality programs and services in the areas of health, education and recreation to our seniors and to the community.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'As of April, the end of April this year, our membership is at 3434. So the the center is growing. The membership grows. During 2014, we've served 630 folks in tech service. We provided transit or travel and trip opportunities for 1012 people.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So each month we do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A monthly trip where.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Folks can travel outside of Alameda, but we also do extended travel and we partner with collect tours. And so some of those trips for 2014 included a trip to the Tournament of Roses Parade, the French Riviera and New York City Islands of New England and Portugal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we do fundraising at the senior center and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And back in 1980.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I meant to say earlier that the city realized that they could not solely support Mastic Senior Center, and the senior community realized that they couldn't solely support Mastic Senior Center. So we are a very wonderful partnership. So we do fundraising through the Mastic Senior Center Advisory Board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So 6173 residents 18 years of age and older came out to play bingo, whereas 12,875 sales happened in the thrift shop. So if you think that there was many lookie loos, every time you go to a store, you don't always make a purchase.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's quite vibrant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At our location.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our demographics are really quite interesting. About 41% of the number of members that Jackie just mentioned are of the boomer generation from 50 to 69, which means if your math is good, that close to 50% or 49% of our members are between the ages of 70 and 80 plus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And believe me, if you come over and spend any part of a morning or an afternoon over there, you will see very active seniors. And if you've never seen pickleball played, come over.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So knowing that we were in the midst of a baby boom, we continually reevaluate our program to try to keep everybody happy, if possible and when possible, so that we are serving the 72, 80 plus crowd, but also trying new activities to bring in the 50 plus crowd.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Support Services Mastic Senior Center. The city of Alameda receives a grant through the area agency on Aging of around $25,000 per year. And we also bring awareness to the programs that the county supports. So some of those are highlighted, one being the health insurance counseling program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So four times a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Month we have a rep from a volunteer actually from the High CAPP office that comes out to provide information on insurance counseling. So even if you have a medical bill that you're having troubles with it and you just can't follow the tracking of following through and calling to try to resolve the bill.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If you feel that it's incorrect, the high cap counselor can help you with that. And also through the county is legal assistance for seniors. So they do have limited services that they can provide, but yet they do come out to the center and then the transportation services through Measure B and Measure B funds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have the East Bay Paratransit services. We help with applications. We have the Mr. Tip program, which provides rides help ride home from the medical appointments, the premium taxi program, and then the shuttle that circulates that community on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, which is open to all residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, we try to provide seating to seniors or the disabled individuals first, but in addition, we offer consumer presentations. So that's an opportunity to come out to learn about some of these topics in more detail. And not only do we provide educational opportunities, we also do fun things like we do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We do laughter, yoga. We're going to do something in October where we focus on beauty. So there's we try to serve our interest. We have a nice gentleman in our community, a retired dentist who comes out and provides dental consultation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He volunteers his time. That way you can get a second opinion for free and a podiatrist within our community that comes out to provide consultation as well. The tax preparation assistance. I'm always most pleased with that. In 2014 we served 630 folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that we provided refunds in the amount of glasses work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they don't work. I have $323,652 and also taxes do of 85,962. But what's really, I think moving is that people saved $80,850 because the average cost to have your tax prepared and this is an an inexpensive fee is $150.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that money saved and stayed in somebody's pocket. And then in 2014, we were able to collaborate and partner with Alameda Family Services, which is really huge for us because we've always experienced. Individuals that need case management services and we are not mere recreation, so we're not really skilled or staffed to provide case management services.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have over the years provided information and referral to some of these other county or city entities. But we cannot follow the case through. And Alameda Family Services has been able to really help those individuals and, you know, specifically seniors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you don't often hear of shelters that provide shelter for homeless seniors. So it's a unique area and it's something that has really helped staff and really help those that we serve. So that's been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A real bonus for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In addition to all excuse me, in addition to all these big things, we also focus on food security among our population, which, as you all know, particularly in Alameda County, is a very, very serious issue. We address that through a reasonably priced lunch offered every day to individuals 60 and older.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That provides an opportunity both for a nutritional meal, but also the terribly important aspect of socialization as well. An opportunity to be with other people for part of the day and be with other people over a meal is an ideal way of doing it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have served almost 6700 lunches last year. We have also been in the participated in the process of delivering something in excess of 30,000 of food. We put out bread and all kinds of other food packages and parcels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We even have an organic garden that is growing rapidly and we have put out close to 3200 bags of organic greens and vegetables that people can pick up on their own on a monday. And believe me, they put out 110 bags out and they're gone in 15 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Each bag contains one serving of a salad or green. So we do a lot on small items as well as the big items.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the members of Mastic are phone microphones. Thank you. They then ask the members of Mastic are the role models for healthy active living. 23,064 attended fitness classes now that there is some duplication there. But that does show you that folks value our program and they value it enough that they continue to participate in the program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So whether it's fitness three days a week, yoga twice a week, Pilates dance, you name it, we offer every type of dance class. 24,842 participate in intellectual classes. So we're fortunate enough to offer computer classes, foreign language, and that we offer English as a second language.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'American Sign Language German Conversation Group. French Conversation. Spanish and Italian. Current events. Ceramics. Stained glass. We're really fortunate. And then 17,242 participated in social interaction. So that could be coming into play bridge, sitting together and putting a puzzle together and special events that we offer at the center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Yes, it is. So funding. So as mentioned prior the recreation department matchsticks a division of and they provide 85% of the funding for the center. However, the Mastic Senior Center Advisory Board, through their fundraising avenues provide 15% of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so this past year, we generated $169,710 through fundraising and donations. $23,134 went into capital projects at that included getting wi fi up and running. Finally, it was quite a feat at Mastec because the building is built like a fort.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our walls are very solid and so to get the signals to transmit and we removed the dry rot at belly banned decorative molding from the exterior of the social hall and replaced the overhang over the social hall. We went around and painted all the railings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We worked with a professional landscape.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Firm to come up with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A drought tolerant landscape plan moving forward. And we've also explored purchasing stationery, fitness equipment to go in outdoors. We also are working on adding a bocce ball court and a putting green for our members to use. And we've been working with color consultants because the surplus that was 78,683 will be rolled into painting the exterior as well'",
        "'speaker_6': 'as repairing the dry rod.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The center is managed essentially by the senior center advisory board. It's a 15 member board. We have ten active committees. So there's a lot of volunteer time put in the management of the facility and the management of the programing under Jackie's supervision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The board also manages and operates and sets strategy and goals for two primary fundraising programs, our bingo program, which generates about 40 $800 a month for Saturdays a month, we provide bingo to 100 plus people and our thrift shop, which is open two days a week and provides approximately 70 $200 a month in profit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, all of these are run by volunteers. We've done a direct letter campaign and we're talking about other strategies going forward to look at raising additional dollars. And the key reason for these additional dollars is to maintain what we like to think of as our asset.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But indeed, it's your asset that we're maintaining with you. And we have done that to the tune of just slightly over $1,000,000 in the last 20 years. And we're putting a good deal more into painting and repairing. So if you come and visit the center, you'll see it's an amazingly well-maintained building given its age and the heavy'",
        "'speaker_3': 'use it gets. And a lot of that has to do with what the Mastic Senior Center Advisory Board is able to raise and manage as capital investment for you and the community. The volunteers, as I mentioned in my thank you to you for coming to the recognition luncheon a couple of weeks ago are, of course, the heart'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the Mastic Senior Center program. They serve as board members. They manage the front desk, they serve lunch, they teach classes. They do tax preparation at no fee. They coordinate and assist with the thrift shop and the bingo, both of which take an enormous number of people to manage effectively and well and safely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have over 200 volunteers who have put in just under 25000 hours of volunteer time at a savings of just under $500,000 in labor costs. And that's 12 full time staff equivalents. So that's 12 employees essentially on your payroll based on the work and the activity we're trying to do to generate support for the seniors in the'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And we've developed a fairly strong program of surveying, and we looked at the AARP database of 8000 names and we sent out a survey and 90% of the respondents, 90% of the AARP audience. Are familiar with the Mastic Senior Center 90%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's an astonishing piece of marketing and public relations. 94% of the respondents would recommend Mastic Senior Center to a friend or a family member. Most of that awareness and attention was generated through the activity guide, obviously, but also simply by driving by the Mastic Senior Center.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess the last point I want to make is we have, as you heard at the very beginning, just under 3500 members. That's 5% of your population and they all vote. Thank you so much for supporting the work of Mastec, for supporting the seniors and the community, and for your attention and interest to our work.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'through the big items that you're facing, like the city manager recruitment site a the budget. And we know we've had a lot of extra special meetings lately, but this would just be once a month and it could be canceled if in fact there aren't sufficient items and that we we could keep it down to the two regular'",
        "'speaker_1': 'meetings a month. So really, this is open for discussion and we really just we're trying to get out of here earlier is the main goal. So with that, I don't know if Liz wants to add anything or no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think Laura pretty much has covered it. We we recognize that we've been going late. There's a possibility of going late. And we wanted to give you the option of adding more meetings so you didn't have to do that and sort of adding meetings on the fly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So this is just a recommendation. And we'd you know, we're open to the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'New member. ASHCROFT Thank.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You. So when I first read this, I kind of cringed at the thought of adding more meetings because you have no idea. We read hundreds of pages of material, it seems like every every month, every couple of times, a few times a month.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know it's hard on staff and it's hard for members of the public to come out for extra meetings. But I've talked to some staff members, including our amazing city clerk, Laura Weisinger, and I'm convinced that at least in the near term, we need to do this because as both our interim city manager and city clerk'",
        "'speaker_6': 'noted, we do have some some meaty big ticket items coming before us. And we don't have to go all the way to December with these Wednesday meetings, if it looks like, you know, we came out in July and we just are you know, it's smooth sailing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't have heavy agendas. We can always vote to go back to our two Tuesdays a month. But I think for now it makes sense. So I, for one, am going to support this resolution. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member comments? Ben Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'm actually not going to support this. I cringed when I saw it and still cringing thinking about it. We had four meetings in April, as well as a closed session that lasted, I think, 3 hours.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we have four meetings scheduled in May. And I realize that, you know, we're all new working together and we're working out some of the kinks. But, you know, the message I, I take from this from staff is, you know, we could be as a council and I say we, including myself, you know, more efficient in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the things that we do, more efficient in our comments. You know, we talked about road diets. Maybe we should go on a speech diet during some of our comments because, you know, a lot of the things add up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And now the mayor, you know, is giving the courtesy to the public to go over 3 minutes. And, you know, I hope that the public, you know, respects that courtesy and still stays within the 3 minutes, because if you if you have 30 people talk and they each go over a minute, that's one minute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, if we have five I mean, that's 30 minutes more to a meeting. If you have five agenda items and, you know, we all talk an extra 2 minutes on those those five agenda items, that's another 50 minutes, I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, Oakland, which has a lot bigger problems and a lot longer agendas, has four minute caps on on what the council members can say. And, you know, some of us are our attorneys and we're trained to, you know, argue our motions in a short period of time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I think the message I receive is let's try to be a little more efficient and let's try to be more respectful of the chair and her ability to and let her run the meetings. And I think we can we can maybe revisit this in three months if we're still having having these issues.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. The member comments. Member de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. From my vantage point, there are several questions. The first question that I asked was, you know, what can we do to make sure that the public is well-served? And I think the public is well-served when our staff is fresh and on their toes from meeting to meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So from that vein, I am open to the what's put tonight. So I'm fine with it, but and I'm even fine with moving forward with it. But by the same token, I wouldn't mind hearing what the Sunshine Committee has to say about this, but I think we can still move forward.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if they want to chime in, let them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. When I was on the council before we had our because we had redevelopment and there was the element of reuse and restoration authority which handled issues the base. The base is still being looked at for development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it didn't go away, but the meeting went away. I'm for this as long as we don't start the second Wednesday of the month in May. Because we already have too many meetings in May. Not too many. But the necessary meetings may, I think, to pile on would be counterproductive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do think until the base is substantially under the rest of the city, that it is appropriate to have set aside an additional meeting a month. To address the timely discussion and also to allow the public to be able to participate at a reasonable hour.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again in these issues of of base development, as well as the complex running of the city that we have now. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate vice mayors saying reasonable hour because my concern is that we will be here after 11:00, at least three days a week and probably more. And I, I would be the council. Is that something that you would entertain, that we would set a time of being done by 11:00?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. I thought you were going to ask if we might try to do what our counterparts in Oakland do and limit ourselves to 4 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And my concern is being done by 11:00.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I think that might help us do that. Not that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's unfair. I'm sorry I asked a specific question. I'm looking for agreement by council that we would be done by 11:00 if in fact, we are looking at being here after 11:00. I do not plan to support this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would agree with member ODY that this needs to go back to open government then because I think we do have a problem in regards to public. These are to be public meetings. Our public has already had the opportunity for years to know that we have these meetings on set dates and these would be additional dates that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they may very well have other commitments on Wednesdays and not knowing and not and have their schedule ready to go without being able to participate in these meetings. And in regards to the coming of ordinances at regular meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think it would be appropriate to bring an ordinance on a Wednesday where we have not normally had a meeting in that. Again, I think it goes to public participation and I would suggest it goes back to the open government then for approval for their feedback.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's what they're about and I agree with the member Odie on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, the mayor, I'd like to actually thank you for your comments motion that we tabled this for 60 days and send it to the Open Government Commission for their comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sarah Second. I'll second that. Any discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that scaling up for 60 days eats up any value that we're going to get from adding extra meetings. So, you know, I do think that if we don't have to and I have to introduce ordinances at these Wednesday meetings, I see there's plenty of other activities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just in the normal course of running the city that we place here and having the ordinance introductions to at a regularly scheduled meeting. I think we can live with that. This provides us with the with the initial debate, the ability to be able to hear initiatives among our many council referrals, to hear the follow up, which'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm checking off the boxes because we have a bunch of council referrals that hit at the beginning of the year that are about due for their their follow up and response from staff. So we need capacity. And I think that if we have these meeting dates scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll be able to use them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Anna maria. I just make one clarification. The idea of this resolution is to make these regular, regular meetings, which would then allow for ordinances to be introduced at them. I mean, we can always add special meetings like we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In fact, tomorrow is a special meeting. But this the intent of this resolution is to make these added meetings, regular meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam, every underscore my point is, and I think the point the mayor was making is Tuesday night's city council night. That's the regular meeting. These are add on meetings. And I think this council can choose not to introduce ordinances at the ADD on meetings so that we can have people in the normal normal course of time come'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to a meeting where there's an ordinance to be introduced. Like I said, there's plenty of other city business that doesn't require introducing an ordinance that we could fill these meetings with and have people get out of here at a reasonable time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'May I come in?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcroft Thank.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You, Mayor Spencer. I actually wouldn't want to tie staff's hands, especially because I think in the near term there may be the need to hear ordinances at some of these special meetings. Again, this wouldn't start until June. And then we're talking about June and July.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We go dark in August and we can see what happens from there on out. But I, I do agree with the vice mayor's initial assessment that this at this particular point in time, it would be a good idea to add this additional meeting per month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Odie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I mean it. If someone wants to propose a compromise that we just do this and June, July and then reevaluate it, I mean, I could probably support that. I just think adding six more meetings at it for the rest of the year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we're already meeting enough. We need to be a little more efficient in getting through our stuff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we need just procedurally, do we need to vote on the motion before us because it's been moved and seconded, or does it have to be withdrawn before we can consider? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can outright. I don't think the votes are there, so I'll just withdraw.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we have ever met Amir?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to say that the compromise idea that Councilmember Brody mentioned is a good incremental steps. It still it it satisfies the desire to schedule regular Wednesday meetings, but in a limited manner for the next June and July and allows us to retrace our steps and move accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And at the same time, I think it allows for substantive input on the part of the Open Government Commission's less than saying Commission, should they so choose.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll make a motion that we are scheduled to meet the additional meeting date on the second Wednesday, Wednesdays of June and July, and evaluate scheduling of the rest year. At the end of the July meeting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. I, I, i.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Could we get some clarification on whether or not the ordinances can be introduced? Because that is that was one of the intent was to be allowed to introduce ordinances on these meetings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I personally think that makes sense for these two extra meetings that we're considering. I don't see why we would tie staff's hands at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think it's unfortunate that wasn't asked before the vote on the motion. Right. So personally, I don't think it's appropriate to do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I move and I agree. I move that we do not unless there's. Legal ramifications is an exception in that we're compelled to take an action by ordinance due to time that we don't introduce new ordinances at the additionally scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those are the regularly scheduled Tuesday meetings.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Oh, second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. I oppose.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion carries. Thank you. Four, two, one. All right, next item 60.'"

    "Resolution on Waste Collection Rates and Fees for Alameda County Industries.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'I like hearing to consider adoption of resolution establishing an integrated waste collection, ceiling rates and service fees for Alameda County Industries for rate period. 14th July 2015 to June 2016.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor, Members of the City Council, I am Liam Garland with the Public Works Department. It is good to be back in front of you on the issue of balancing our interest in protecting ratepayers from rate increases, along with fair wages and benefits for the sorters at Alameda County Industries facility.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you may remember, we were discussing this issue on April 7th in an informational report. I'm back here with the options clarified and ready to walk through them. And this time there is a staff recommendation around option number three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let me lay those options out right now. The first option is the indexed increase. This is the requirement of the franchise, essentially a series of cost of living indices applied to to the franchise, and that would be for 2.8%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The second option is HCI Alameda County Industries or ACS original application for 10.58%. And the third option is the negotiated compromise that was achieved within about a week of before the information report I shared on April 7th. That compromise brought the initial rate increase for next year down to 7.7%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the questions that was raised in the last council meeting was to really dig in to the issue of Alamy to his fair share of the rate increase. So I want you to take a look at this picture you have in front of you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are sorters from Alameda County Industries facility. The material going along that sorting line. You've got material from Alameda. You've got material from Livermore and also San Leandro. Interestingly, San Leandro, even though it's the home city for the facility, actually has the least amount of tons going into it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's about a little bit over 7000 tons. The most are coming from Livermore and that's over 16,000 tons. And Alameda is right in the middle there, although that arrow is unfortunately placed toward that Saunders head. The it's over 10,000 tons.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they're this is where the the portion of Alameda is recycling going in the facility is about 31.1%. Now, the next few slides are going to walk through how we turn that percent into a number. And that number is the 8000 $849,012.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is the incremental wage and benefit increases to the orders. And so that's what I'm going to do in the next few slides here. You can see a similar table to what you've seen before, but updated and the first or the second column that says staffing agency remember that was the temporary staffing agency of formerly contracted with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'by Alameda County industries and they're the burdened rate essentially the all in costs for HCI were about 1391 under that I just give me one moment. It's about 1391 under the state staffing agency. And the actual rate being paid to the sorter was roughly $9 by the staffing agency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then the San Leandro Living Wage Ordinance occurred and there was a jump. So we went from 1391 per hour on that burn rate to 1783 per hour. And importantly, that jump mostly represents a jump in hourly rate. So that jumped from $9 per hour to $14.50 per hour.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's what's happening currently. And essentially San Leandro is rate payers are paying this incremental difference as we speak. The question in front of us is what to do on July 1st moving forward. And there the jump. There's another jump and that's the $25.60 as a burned rate per hour, although this is a little bit different in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the sense that most of that jump relates to additional benefits. This is about affordable health care, sick vacation time, etc.. And you so you see the jump from 326 per hour and benefits, taxes, insurance up to $9.92 per hour.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, in addition, on this table, you see that the the agreement that's been reached by the ILWU, International Longshore and Warehouse Union and ECI, it's not just for the next year, it's for the next four years. And so you will see increases that are not as steep for the next four years, but still increases nonetheless.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now we're going to take that, that and turn it into numbers upon which our rates are based. And so essentially what we've done here is we can project the cost of having the two shifts of orders with the new wage and benefit increases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's about $4.8 million. We then back out those staffing agency costs. So those are subtracted out. You're left with a total incremental labor cost of about 2.7 million. However, almeida's portion of that is only 31.1%. That's where the $849,012 figure comes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Next we move.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Through and now we've got to turn this into our rates. And here we started. If next year we were to start with our current rates, what was the revenue would be at the end of the year? It's 17.3 million or so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so then we do some division to say, well, if we want to raise that additional $849,012, we need a 4.9% increase in rates. One more step, and that is to do the essentially that the indexed increase on top of that and with that you get the across the board 7.7% increase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm hoping that that slide is clearer than the slide that was presented on on April 7th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Very clear. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course. And next, I want to talk a little bit about the how the stakeholders involved in this process all made significant concessions in order to help offset the increases on Almeida's rate payers. So if you take a look here, you can see that the ILWU deferred wage rate increases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They delayed employer contributions to the 4a1k plan until year three in order to help offset the rate increases, Alameda County and the industries agreed to forego 10% of its profit on the wage increase. So this is something that's built into our franchises the that 10% profit and they agreed to forego it for that 835,000 plus dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They also agreed to add an additional service or pilot, an additional service for a multi-family residence and annual boppy pickup program. Finally, the city or city staff had proposed to agree to forego the 10% city franchise fee. Again, just on the incremental wage increase and on that, I'm actually going to pause.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our assistant city attorney, Andrew Gopnik has a comment to share on that. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. I'm Enrico Panik.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Assistant city attorney. As Mr. Garland just indicated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Option three before you requires the stakeholders each to make concessions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I want to speak to you just briefly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About the city's concession. And that is forgoing a portion of the city's franchise fee in order for the city to do that. We have to amend the franchise agreement. And under the Alameda City Charter, Section 18, dash one, that amendment to the franchise agreement can only be done by ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if you were to choose this option today, that portion that you see up there of the city's contribution to this deal, we'd come back to you at the appropriate time for an ordinance that would amend the agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The resolution that is before you that supports that recommendation does not include the change to the franchise agreement. It only adjust the rates, the repair rates. I'm available to answer any questions you have on that point. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what staff has done is to talk directly with Alameda County Industries about this. And essentially Alameda County Industries, because of the urgency involved in this, you have three cities all acting in concert for all of their different portions of these additional wages and benefits and some bank confidence that Alameda County Industries is concerned about how they're'",
        "'speaker_4': 'willing to move forward. And what essentially that means is they'll have to pay the franchise fee. So even though the spirit of the compromise was that they would not have to pay the franchise fee, they will. And in turn, what I and RCI will figure out in the next few months is what's the mechanism to essentially offset'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that increased cost for them? And I'll bring that mechanism back to council for for council approval. It's an issue that I'm confident it can be worked through. And just given this issue coming up now, it's something that that can be worked through later and again brought back to council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm happy to answer any questions about that or I can finish the presentation that we can talk more about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh member. Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'll have some questions, but go ahead and finish your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd actually like clarification if you have a dollar amount and what that equates to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. The dollar amount is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Able to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So which dollar amount are we referring to this?'",
        "'speaker_0': '10% for city franchise fee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe it's 90. It's a little bit over $90,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Question Amendment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Jodi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are getting a portion of the increase as well as part of our franchise fee. We're not waiving the entire amount, just the part that constitutes the 4.9 if we approve. Oh, well, there's like two components, right? There's exactly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's two commands, essentially. What's going to happen now is ACI is paying this franchise fee on the incremental cost, which it had not planned on paying and the cities receiving it on that additional cost for that franchise fee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'll have the precise number in just a couple of minutes. Next, I want to just make sure it's super clear what the ratepayer impact is of this third recommended option. If you look at the blue cells in the upper right hand corner, those are in the 20 gallon and 32 gallon subscription categories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are the most common categories. About 95% of all Alameda residents are in one of those two categories. The option number three for the 77 7.7% increase. It essentially would increase from the existing rate about $2.19 per month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that is right over there. So you compare that with that option two, we had talked about on April 7th, and you see the difference is about $0.80 or so. So we've been able to help offset that increase by about $0.80.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're at that $2, an extra $2.19 per month. The annual impact for that. In other words, if you take that additional $2.19 multiplied by 12 for ratepayers and the 20 gallon subscription rate, they'll be paying an additional $26.28.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Similarly, on the 32 gallon, the additional $2 and 76 per month has an annual impact of about $33.12. So those are the rate impacts. And remember, it's not just the jump in this coming year, it's also the rate impacts over the next few years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so on this slide, what we've done is lined up the three options and then compared what the projected future rate impacts are among the options, option number one is the indexed increase. So there there's no there's no further negotiated wage increases under that option.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Option number two is AC's original application. There you see that the the increases are between about 11 and $0.17 per per month over the next four years. Option three, remember, it's an attempt to smooth out some of those the increase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's not a big of a ratepayer impact that first year the the increases in future years is a little higher it's between 27 and $0.39 per month. Again, to annualize that, that means not starting this year but the following year, that as a result of this agreement between ACA and AMW, the annual impact for a 32'",
        "'speaker_4': 'gallon rate subscriber would be $3.24. So with that. Oh, I just want to go over the three options staff is recommending the negotiated compromise as it's a balance of protecting that rate payer interest. Want to make sure that you know rate payers are struggling want to make sure that we're we're protecting against rate increases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the same time is ensuring that disorders at Alameda County Industries receive fair wage and benefits. With that, I'm here for questions also. We've got folks from Allegheny County Industries and ILWU as well to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or find questions. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Amir Spencer. So thank you for coming back with more information in this current staff report. The. I'm on page four of your staff report you refer to. Yes. One minute. Okay. So on April 27th and May 4th, respectively, the city councils of Livermore and San Leandro are set to address whether their rates should account for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their portions of Asia as increased labor costs in 20 1516. So do you have the outcome of those votes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have some, yes. So the city of Livermore voted, I believe on April 20, the 30th. They directed their staff to bring back a proposal that is very similar to our number third option, essentially forgoing the their franchise fee for going as high as profit on the 10% same schedule of hourly rate and benefits that ASI and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I LW have agreed to. San Leandro is up later on this month.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'OC not not May 4th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They they've pushed it back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then. Okay. Going on to the. This is an attachment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hm. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is exhibit one, the IOW use letter of understanding. That is anyway dated April 2nd in the last paragraph, paragraph number four at the bottom of the page there says that ECI and the union agree that if any of the rate increases proved to be insufficient to support the agreement memorialized in Attachment A, then the parties will'",
        "'speaker_6': 'continue bargaining in good faith towards a mutually acceptable initial collective bargaining agreement. So. At what point will we, the city, know if these proposed rate increases are going to be sufficient or not to support this agreement?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. I'm actually going to have comment from ECI and Fred from the ILWU. Answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor. Council members can't connect with HCI with the MRU. What we're trying to do is set a structure to go forward for the next five years. We knew we wouldn't get we had some elements left in the agreement to still do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, we're bound by NORAD and all that we have to to finish out. The bigger issue for C.I. is our credit facilities with our banks are up in June. We have to have city votes on this in order for the banks to believe that we can move forward, for them to restructure our debt and for us to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'go forward. So it's eminent that we had to show some things, cooperation with with the union, with labor, that we basically have a deal. The intent is we get the votes from the cities. All cities agree we're going to move forward July 1st on this, and that's a commitment from us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate that. I'm not sure. I've had my question answered, and maybe this is where the union rep comes in, but. He did the wording that they agree. If any of the rate increases proved to be insufficient to support the agreement, then the parties were continuing bargaining in good faith toward a mutually acceptable initial collective bargaining agreement'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But if the rates are going up, doesn't that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, the rates going up this hour. Yes. What we've presented should be adequate to do what we need to do here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For how long? Or maybe.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This year. For this year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But aren't we looking at an agreement that goes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Back five years? Yes. And there's slight increases involved in this presentation each year, the small incremental increases in future years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is it Ace's position that those small incremental increases will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Be just the initial? Yeah. Once we're done, we will be signed with a bargaining agreement shortly. We're almost we're almost complete. And I think Mr. Packer would agree.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have been speaking to the microphone, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. Oh, we I would agree with Kent that with that, we are very close to an agreement. What you see there is similar to what we did in other cities, because basically the the although we're bargaining with a private employer, the outcome of that bargaining depends on their major contracts, which are public contracts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when those public contracts are, you know, come and it's one of the things that Alameda County overall has lacked, it's recognized that for the holding, but it has in recognize that for delivering the recycling services. And so what we what we put in all the agreements that come before a vote, there's one that came after the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'vote, but the ones that come before a vote of any of any civic body have included that that if if we don't get the support of the civic body, the city council or the garbage district in other cases, then we're in a position where we're going to have to keep bargaining and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because we look because the underlying economics shift. But.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So just to be clear, so it is ILWU U's position that the proposed rate increases over the next five years as as outlined in option three are sufficient to meet your needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. All right. And just to be clear, at the you know, right now we're in this process that you're contemplating in which is going forward through the county, will create a standard where there won't be the kind of of of of ups and downs that there are right now in the value of the labor of the people'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sitting here to sort through the recyclables. So it's there. We're coming to a point of an even standard or a for recycling contract, which will shift. And the, you know, you see smaller increases because it's the lift in the beginning that goes with the medical benefits, the really big.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank thank you both for those explanations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, they sag.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's just a question. So just a. A burnish the point even more. So it's your both of your sense that the rate increases contemplated tonight are sufficient, but that if there are not, you can go back. You are both committed to having some kind of continuing dialog.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And did I hear right that what's drive possibly driving any uncertainty that can lead to some shortfall in the revenue? Am I hearing it right that that was driving that is the the medical portion of the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, it's it's the cities. It's having all three cities participate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's really and right now, as it stands, Livermore came back with, you know, they voted unanimously to follow up on the recommendation that staff gave, which is essentially the exactly the same program. They just got to go back for a second vote, just like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just like we did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last time where, you know, you give direction. They gave the direction to go with the recommendation. San Leandro will take place on the 18th. And the reason they wanted to go last is to make sure everyone else did their part and then they're going to do their part.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if there was any shortcomings, potentially make up any little differences. But obviously, we want it to be fair across the board.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, I understand. Thank you. Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other clarifying questions or I'd like to ask Steph real quick? So it was my understanding that there were annual reviews, but that still take place in outside of. So could you explain what could happen that then?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, yes. So the our franchise requires an annual adjustment. So every year I will be in front of you whether maybe whether.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You like it or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And those reviews, they happen in essentially you go two years with an indexed rate review, which is essentially applying those cost of living indicators. And then in the third year, there's a detailed rate review where they're we get to open up Alameda County Industries books, look at and more nitty gritty, detailed their expenses and reconcile those and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'come back to council with a recommendation for an adjustment for the next year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to member Ashcraft questions earlier, could there be a difference in these numbers on an annual basis for the next between now and 2020?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. These are definitely project projections. And let me just make sure we're all talking about the same thing in terms of those projected future rate impacts. So for option three, we're looking at that $0.27 to $0.39 per month.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are indeed projections. I can't say with certainty that they will be exactly that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Then, Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to be clear. The slide you just showed. Is that the impact of the just the wage component and or. I thought the slide before was the actual total impact of I mean, the stage six. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Slide five. The $2 in 19. That's that's what we're being asked to pay for exactly for this adjustment that would be in effect as of July 1st, 2015. And of that, $2 in $0.19 for, well, let's choose 276 for the 32 gallon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of that, $0.27 is what's attributable to paying the increased wages to the recycle workers. I know a little different. So the, the I think you're going to the next chart. Ah yes. Yes. And that is that came out the following year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you look at ASI and I'll use agreement in terms of wages and benefits, those go for multiple years. So if you take those assumptions and build that into, oh, what will our rates probably adjust by based on those increases we're talking in that 27 to 39 cent per month range.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does that answer your question? Yeah, I was trying to see if we could hone in on of the of the annual impact to the rate payer or what portion is actually attributable to bringing these these workers up to a living wage?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a dollar 76. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So an annualized, that's a 12 plus whatever.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was like $15 a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Approximately, if you're going to pay that at 2.8% on top anyway. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's that was a number I was looking for. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. What member asked Mr. Garland.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In your staff report, you also mentioned something near and dear to my heart, which is the multifamily pickup. HCA has also agreed to a pilot to pilot a multifamily and your bulky pickup by July one, 2015. Are you going to report back to us or are you just going to start it on a date?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our plan is, if we have if this recommendation is approved, then Kent and I will sit down. We'll figure out the what the requirements and the structure of that program will be. I'm happy to bring back there's an information report or something else to the Council on on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I probably would be more interested in how we're going to inform the public, because we certainly hear those complaints about driving down the street and seeing couches and whatnot, you know, discarded on the sidewalks. And this is something that this program is meant to to address.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to make sure that however you want to do it, it's an effective means of getting the word out to the community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, speakers, thank you. We will have poet Pedro Sanchez and Mr.. Mr. Fred Pecker. Then we're with Abbe. If you can try to limit your comments to 3 minutes, that'd be appreciated.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'As we have as we have mentioned in the past, working on a recycling facility is not an easy.'",

Just say that, you know, we know that there's huge support for recycling as public policy. And as we've moved forward with the campaign, which is a broad based, based campaign on including the environmental community, the religious community, the immigrant community we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have. We have been very gratified to see that people realize that as you add new services, that there's a cost to them. And we look forward and appreciate the deliberations that your staff have done. And we need your support so that we can raise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The value of the work that people do in recycling to a way that people can support their families. And this is a structural change where in Alameda County, for whatever the historical reasons are, the cost of labor was was really under under bid or undervalued.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're in the process of trying to change that. And you're part of a historic change, which is part of making recycling truly sustainable. So we appreciate your work. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. I'm Ruth Harvey with the Sierra Club. We are a part of the Alameda County Sustainable Recycling Campaign, which is a coalition of organizations, including environmental groups, labor organizations, faith based organizations, health and safety organizations, and immigrants rights groups that have been working for the last three years to raise the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'wages and benefits of our recycling workers in Alameda County. And we are thrilled to tell you and we are excited that the city of Alameda could be joining city of Oakland, city of Fremont, Newark, Union City to raise the wages of our recycling workers to be parity with those in San Francisco and San Jose.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we heartily support your work and the work of your staff. We very much recommend the staff recommendations to put this tough recommendation for option three and appreciate the city of Alameda being part of the Alameda County countywide.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Standard for wages and benefits for recycling workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From Rob and I'm Bill Smith. And those are the only slips I have for this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rob Browder, Executive Director, Park Street Business Association. You know, some of you have not heard my my great grandfather was a founding partner in Oakland Scavenger. My grandfather was a garbage man and my dad was a garbage man.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I know a little bit about garbage. Didn't come out right. I will tell you when they were in the garbage business. The idea of recycling, as I've told you many a time, was throw the battery in the back of a truck and we'll be fine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think they ever envisioned the type of recycling that we're trying to do today. And I know that they never envisioned folks working on a line, picking out hypodermic needles and all the other stuff that gets put into the recycling.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while I can assure you the membership that I represent. Would be very happy to be talking about a negotiated seven and a half percent decrease in the rates. That's not going to happen. It's not going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'RCI does a terrific job. From our point of view. They're very receptive to our issues that we have. They bend over backwards. They really do to provide us service in the district. They are taking the lead in putting out clear stream units and bagging the city cans for our events for the 4th of July event.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And obviously, we also agree. That people deserve a living wage, especially for this type of job, that frankly. And I'll go ahead and say it. No one in this room except for those people that are doing the work would ever do this kind of work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they deserve the increase. Asai deserves the increase, and we urge you tonight to go ahead and pass this and give Asai their 7.7% increase. Thank you.'",

Update CWA 9119 out of Livermore Lawrence Livermore National Lab. And about a week ago I went to the Little Moore City Council meeting and introduced myself and I thought, I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'want to report back. And parts of the meeting relevant in earlier discussion tonight, how to get people out of the council chambers early and make the meeting shorter. They've got Livermore has a beautiful Bankhead theater. I'd love to see an arts center like that in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they talked about that. That went pretty quickly. And they have they have a beautiful new city hall with lots of offices. All right. And for the staff. And then I went to the city hall expecting to go inside to get into the council chambers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, you walk way back behind and the council chambers are two double wide trailers with a little antique or walking up. It don't even barely hold 100 people total. I think 102 of the fire marshals and the chairs are uncomfortable and the tables are, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the meetings will not last till midnight. So there's it's my suggestion for you there to emulate your colleagues at Livermore to make commuting meeting short. But on a more serious note. Livermore is known as the Cowboy City, is a liberal rodeo every summer there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they go by it and it's very conservative and. When I talked, told him about what it means to have a low wage worker, that that low wage is not free, that low wage requires a government term, but those times are going to make it to pitch in the food, the food stamps, the housing assistance for affordable'",
        "'speaker_3': 'housing. And I think some you've heard me talk about affordable housing here in town before and other other things. So it requires subsidies. And even The Wall Street Journal is beginning and featuring editorials on that these days, too, that these low wages are really not good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really urge you to support and follow your lead and your colleagues in Livermore and vote for unanimously for this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That was our last public. Speaker Member Comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor I think I'd like to make a motion that we adopt the recommendation of the staff. All right. Adopt the resolution that establishes the new integrated waste collection ceiling rates in what was described as option three. I appreciate the work that's been done to get us to option.'",
        "'speaker_4': '3/2, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any discussion member ASHCROFT just briefly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that on page four of the staff report, Mr. Garland did such a nice, well-stated description of what we're doing, why we're doing what we're doing, that this 7.7% increase balances almeida's interest in keeping rates reasonable with ensuring Ace's sorters receive fair pay and benefits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that really and it was just said by our articulated by our previous speaker but that when you're when you have people who are working full time and yet they're prepared, bear with me and my finicky iPad that you have people who are working full time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And yet until this agreement was reached and by the way, I also want to congratulate ECI, because I know they came a long way, too, in the negotiations. And I read your your statement, your letter. And I do understand the financial implications of your requirements to the bank who's financing your operation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think for all of us who put our bins out on whatever night you put your remember to put your bins out, you're just so happy that the next morning when you come out, they're empty, they've been emptied, and you put them back where they belong.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you don't really think much about what goes on after the truck picks those those containers up. But we want to see the workers treated fairly, but we want to see the company continue in business. And I think the city ILWU and ACI all did a good job in coming together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it means that this will this is the cost. And I think it's a modest one. But to provide fair wages and benefits, which include medical benefits, sick pay, vacation in a modest retirement fund. I think this is both reasonable and just and that, as Mr. Smith just said, there is a cost to society when workers go'",
        "'speaker_6': 'without these basic benefits. So I'm delighted that I think we're moving towards supporting this this option three this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Member Ody I thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to echo the comments made by my colleagues previously and the Speaker's, you know, to get where, where we are today on this. It's just amazing and it's a testament to everyone that worked together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ACA, the Sierra Club, ILWU and working towards this is the third time this has been before us. I'll try to be brief, but you know, if you remember the situation that occurred just recently before the San Leandro Living Wage Ordinance, these workers were employed by the staffing agency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then there was a lawsuit because they, the staffing agency, felt they shouldn't comply with the San Leandro Living Wage Ordinance. And then RCI took it upon themselves to bring those workers into ACA, comply with the living wage ordinance, give these workers a well-deserved and, you know, well overdue increase in pay, and then they collectively bargain with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ILWU to, you know, bring them out of poverty and give them the respect that they need. So I think if you look at a dollar 76 a month, $21.12 a year, you know, to have all of these families now have a living wage, be health insurance, not on Medi-Cal anymore, you know, not not costing the state additional'",
        "'speaker_4': 'money. You know, and see, starting to put money away for retirement, which probably two years ago when they were making $9 an hour, they never dreamed of. I think that is a very small price to pay for for restoring dignity to these families.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm going to be supportive of this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Data, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just a minute. Continuing clarifying questions. So if we pursued option one, the increase would be 2.8%. And in general, from year to year, we adjust the wages based upon the index, which in this case is 2.8%. Now, the way that I'm reading option three is that in addition to the index, there is the adjustment to account for'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the wage and benefit impact stemming from the living going to a living wage, in which case the adjust. It isn't 2.8%, but in total it's 7.7%. And within that is the 2.8%. So the question that I have is so when I read table three is that makes that mean that the 7.7% from 2016 to 20 15 to'",
        "'speaker_9': '2016 is also going continuing for the next year, for the next year, or is the next year really just subject to the the the typical index adjustment that we do from year to year based upon some index?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will be a tip, actually. Let me pause and let's hear here from Marva Sheehan from age. Okay, with that answer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. I'm Marva Sheahan with HFT consultants, and we're the consulting firm that has been reviewing the numbers and putting together with staff and with ACI next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And actually to your response, your question that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The increase that you're seeing on there, the $0.33, the 39 cent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Numbers are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Attributable to the sort of wage increase. That's just that subject. Okay. Next year is what we call a cost base.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Year or a detailed review year where we will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Go in and look at the collection operations in detail and look at those cost and come up with what the rate increase will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The sorter piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be another element, but next year we're looking at everything in total.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And that's important because I think the message that I'm trying to drive home to the community is that in this instance on here on May 5th, 2015, we're making an adjustment to reflect that the workers need a living wage, but we're also making adjustment based upon the usual way we make adjustments, which is the index and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the per the way that we make adjustments. The following year, we're going to do the cost approach, which you just mentioned, but then we'll get back on track to the index approach.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then we'll do the index. I believe it. You go to two years index and then back to the cost base.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Long story short, we are we are not saying that we're we're plugged in to a 7% increase all the time because because we will be we will have already baked into the cake the the the living wage effects.'",

It pays just for the legal services, but it keeps us anchored here in the city where a countywide agency we're active in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Domestic Violence Task Force were actually written into the Alameda Police Department's protocol. They call us whenever there's a domestic violence incident. And without without this funding, it would be difficult for us to remain so firmly anchored in the city.'",

I'll wear two hats tonight, so I'll start off as executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative and answer Councilmember Ashcraft question about the community based development organization. Funding CBD oil at it is CBD oil community based development organization.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not Corporation is a specific designation by CDBG for organizations that comply with very strict guidelines around doing community development. And you have to have a board that represents the the community you're serving, which our board does, and the funding allows you to do economic development program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've used it to build out some of our social enterprise programs, which then employ residents in both permanent and part time and and training capacity. So the ultimate goal of it is to train and prepare low income residents of the area for employment, permanent employment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we target 40 people, 40 residents a year. That's our goal. And over the last five years, we've done some amazing things with that, getting people into workforce, developing social enterprises that employ people out of the base. This is also, as you may be familiar with CDBG funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's so there's different pools of funding. There's public service, there's rehabilitation, there's blight and whatnot. Public service has a cap on the amount of money you can spend. You cannot exceed that cap. So we're always rubbing up against the ceiling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'CBD oil funds, which are only allowed for designated seed CBD oil organizations, are not included in that cap. So in actuality, you get to do much more services because you're doing it on a community based development organization funding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope that makes some sense. It allows us to do a lot more services for the community without negatively impacting wonderful organizations like the Food Bank Building for futures for women and children that also need to provide public services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, now switch hats. Good evening. My name is Doug Biggs. I'm the president of the Social Service Human Relations Board. And I do want to clarify before I start those remarks that the Social Service Human Relations Board only reviews public service dollars, does not review CBO dollars at all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this year, we played a little bit of a different role in in the process, both developing the RFP and actually doing the scoring. In the past, the housing authority would do the scoring and we would look at their recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this time we kind of reversed roles. Scoring Matrix was developed in a dance that all members of Shrub participated in the scoring. We did receive four applications and all four were deemed to be highly competitive, highly worthy, really met all the goals and the needs that SSA Tabi was looking to fulfill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So all four programs were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recommended for funding. As Claudio mentioned, the total amount requested was less than what was available. I think for us the takeaway from this is really it's a sad one. People have given up. People have given up on CDBG over the last decade.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have been the federal government has reduced the money so much that so much of what we used to fund is now out of the picture. We're down to the bare, bare, bare necessities. And organizations have just given up looking to CDBG as a way to support them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's a sad state of affairs to be in. We did look at allocating the remaining funds, but as was mentioned, staff asked that it be set aside for conciliation services. That is clearly within the realm of authority and is appropriate to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do want to though track those funds in the concept of public services and have them come back to us and report on how those funds were actually spent, what kind of services came out of that, because we know that next year will be looking at this again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in in conclusion, we strongly support the staff recommendations and ask that you approve the allocations as recommended.'",

Lastly, rent increases would go into effect if Iraq hearing is held after the effective date of the increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the amount of the increase is reduced through the hiring process, the property owner and tenant would work out a credit to any and any agreed upon overpayment of rent, which is how rent increases are handled right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the current situation now. All of these concepts are addressed in both ordinances. Ordinance does not have a threshold rent increase amount that must be triggered to access the rack process. This approach is current, is consistent with the current rack process and with racks recommendation that no threshold be established under the new ordinance.'",

So if the council wants to go with with a minimum threshold increase, staff would look to council to set that percentage amount for the rent increase because there wasn't consensus. If the council approves the ordinance, B would need to establish the threshold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It should be noted that as drafted, there's also an informal conciliation process, the process that was just described as part of the CDBG hearing. The tenants and landlords.

        "'speaker_4': 'And there could be valid reasons why a tenant or months after filing a complaint is evicted, may be nonpayment of rent, maybe nuisance, whatever, you know, owner move in, whatever the the different grounds are. But I'm just worried that we're you know, we're we're being so precise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And firm in defining that as a retaliatory eviction. When I believe the the law is that it's a a presumption of retaliatory eviction that can be overcome. That's a lot to be rebutted by a landlord.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So is the suggestion to substitute the word presumed for deemed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't have the civil code in front of me, but housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I would agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Presumed to be a presumed to be a retaliatory eviction, which I believe there's a civil code section that that. Yes, that 1940 2.5. And also one more thing. I mean, that's in the notice, but I didn't see that in any of the of the actual ordinance that that we're assuming that this is a presumption that can be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'rebutted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the intention was to rely on the civil code. And so if we have misstated it, I I'll try to look it up right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't have Westlaw access anymore, so I can't read it. That was that was my clarifying question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I'd like to hear the answers to that, too. But I also bookmarked a paragraph on page three of the staff report. It's right there in the middle of the page, the paragraph that starts under state law.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing providers must provide 60 days written notice to tenants if rents are going to be increased by 10% or more must provide 30 days notice, rents are going to be raised by less than 10%. But the further into the paragraph it says that as part of the are a CS review of the original draft ordinance, the chair'",
        "'speaker_6': 'observed that recently some housing providers, rather than providing a notice of rent increase, are instead electing to provide the 60 day notice to vacate. By providing that notice, the current tenant is required to vacate and the housing provider may then impose on the new tenant whatever rent the market will bear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have two questions. This is troubling to hear of this, although I also and this is where my fervent desire for a data collection and a concern to study that comes in, because if we're going to make good, informed decisions as a council, we want to be relying on good data.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm not questioning what anybody has heard. But but, you know, it could be anecdotal, it could be just happening once. But do you have any idea what kinds of numbers we're talking about of this example that I just read?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And within what time frame is it just starting to happen now? Have we seen it for a year or so and do we have documentation? But more to the point, is there anything the city can legally do to prevent this practice of issuing a 60 day notice to vacate without even getting to a rent increase?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Question or so the information. So without it, I mean, this and this is an issue that Councilmember Odie brought up in January about the issue of just cause eviction without a just cause eviction ordinance in the city. There is there isn't anything the city can do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The state law allows on a 60 day notice for somebody who's lived in a unit for more than 12 months, they have to be given a 60 day notice. But they can be evicted without, you know, without cause.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there are some jurisdictions in the state of California that have just cause eviction ordinances, that require that there has to be cause loud music disturbance, you know, nonpayment, you know, a whole variety of of reasons that you would be able to evict.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But. But not to get around notifying tenants of a rent increase. If that then becomes the requirement here that you have to notify people of the rent review process. That kind of thing. So that's that's the answer to the question, I think, about what the city can do regarding whether or not we're seeing more evictions that are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'just 60 day notices without a rent increase. That is a relatively new phenomenon, and I think it's probably the profile of that issue has been raised as we've heard about more and more rent increases and the discussion about, you know, putting more teeth, I guess, into our rent review process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if people are less interested in in dealing with the process and that kind of thing, this could be a strategy that they would pursue. It's possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I might suggest that they're not mutually exclusive propositions. I think the rack, obviously, is the rental rate. So it's talking about rent increases. But I think we probably should consider, if again, to my point, I would like to know, you say that this is happening more frequently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I know I said we're hearing about it more recently. We've only heard, you know, anecdotal, a handful of instances in which this has happened that we've heard about our staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I, I would like some attempt to quantify and see if that is a problem, you know, that our tenants in Alameda are facing. And perhaps that's something that if we were to decide to do, a consultant study could be on the within the deliverables.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this point, if we could try to do clarifying questions, we have at least seven or eight speakers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And I was clarifying for me from the the staff report. Let's see here. I think that's all for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For de sa.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is to clarify in question the way that the system now works is that when a tenant has concerns about rent increases, they fill out their form, they participate in the process and the involvement of the property owner. She or he can get involved or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And whether or not right now in the current whether or not they get involved when the rent review advisory board makes a determination. For the most part, it's oftentimes a letter saying that if you can, you know, become something other than that, then what the tenant is concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And oftentimes and sometimes that letter is brought up to city council for the mayor to sign. So it's basically a letter. And I raise that because. What's different now is that and I'm going to read from the staff report that explained that if a housing provider failed to appear without good cause, or if a representative of the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'housing provider did appear but did not have the authority to act, the rent review advisory committee would make a finding to that effect. A tenant then would be able to cite to the ordinance that the rent increase was void as the defense in an unlawful detainer action that a housing provider might file against the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And all of that that that the ability for the tenant to a site that is because of the ordinance. So here's the question. Now within the context of what we just said, within the staff report. The property owner could still attend the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And choose to not agree with the rent review advisory committees. The key thing is it's just that we're we have a mechanism to get the property owner there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is correct. The mediation process itself is strictly a voluntary process. But what we're doing under the proposed ordinance is mandating the participation. But any any outcome, any final mediated solution is voluntary. Thank you. Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Right. I'm going to call the speakers now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Great stuff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember Odie, I did find the site in the civil code. And what what the law says is in an action brought by or against the lessee pursuant to the subdivision, the lessee shall bear the burden of producing evidence that the lessors conduct was in fact retaliatory.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So based on that, I would suggest that we just change that language in the notice that says housing providers efforts to evict a tenant within six months of a tenant's requesting a hearing may be used as evidence of retaliatory conviction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Eviction, that conviction, will that work?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I depend on you, but I think that would work out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Angela. How about then Ken Peterson and then. And 11.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor and vice mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Angela Hawk about I'm the founder of the Alameda Renters Coalition. And I was a part of the housing discussions that led up to these ordinances that are before you today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to say how excited we are at the prospect of having a little more strength added to the Rent Review Advisory Committee. And we think that these new ordinances are going to give renters more tools to fight rent increases as they come into their mailboxes, especially excited that they're going to be noticed of the existence'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the Rent Review Advisory Committee. And I want to take a moment and really encourage renters to use these tools because they're going to be available to them. And now we have a renters coalition and a group of landlords who want to make sure that the Alameda renters get to stay in our awesome city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, we are now faced with greater challenges, as I mentioned earlier. We have now, at least to my knowledge, in the last three months, at least five probably more notices of 60 day notice to vacate properties. And this is disrupting families lives.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's taking kids out of schools. And we think that it's an ethical for landlords to do such a thing without providing the full return of a security deposit, support for moving expenses and cleaning good referrals to new housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I really urge the City Council, after dealing with these rent review increases, to find ways to address also these 60 day increases. I'm hopeful that the community of Alameda can come together in the way that we did with these rent increases to find new solutions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I really look forward to looking to working with our great landlords here because we have been able to to find new homes for people. And I think that that's the Alameda spirit. So I want to thank you guys and thank city staff for all of the hard work that they've put in to make these ordinances.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I hope that you will see fit to vote for the ordinance without the threshold for the rec. And I thank you very much for your time. Good evening. If.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Peterson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. I actually intended to talk on the question of the AMP contract and so that's been continued. I understand. So relinquish my time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much, guys. This late.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then. And only.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So hard. You. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening again. Once again, I'm Andy Balaban, the immediate past president of the Alameda Association Realtors. And here, on the request of our current president, Mr. Tony Berg, to speak on behalf of our members, the Alameda Association of Realtors would like to go on record as being in support of the proposed ordinance for the Rent Review Advisory'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Committees, Rules and regulations with no threshold as outlined in staff presentation. A We believe that renters and landlords should have the option to have the committee mediate whenever a tenant may feel that a rent increases undue or excessive.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We urge the City Council to adopt the the ordinances as outlined in Option A, including all five agreed upon points brought forward by the community. And once again, where there is no threshold for a requirement for a complaint to be filed in regards to rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The next speaker is UTC. It has these three letters here and then Barbara Duncan and then Garfield can cross.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I'm Amanda, and I've lived in Alameda for about 51 years, and in September 2014, I received an increase of $600 more a month. After living.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There for 27.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years. Of course, they asked me if I could stay if I hadn't paid that amount, but I could not stay. So recently I moved into another unit. And at least will be up in August of this year. And I know the rent will increase again.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm asked, can the city council and the mayor please do something about these landlords that raise these to rent outrageously and Bigfoot with no court? Because they want somebody else or they want to protect a unit for relative safety because seniors and people with fixed income really need.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Need your.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Help. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Hello. My name is Barnaby Duncan, and I've.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lived here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About 45.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, I understand that you didn't know what what it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looked.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like. I just got one Saturday. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing made a recommendation, and my landlord signed it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Two months ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Saturday, I get this that I have to pay $170 more now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Would anybody like to see this? Because this is what you're going to see when when you ask the people, let me see what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kind of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Paper you got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's kicking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You out, because this this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tells you right now either pay it or leave. It gives you no options. And I thought I had the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Best landlord because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You haven't done it. But it came.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Last Saturday, so. I guess they're all doing it. There's four units in where I live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All four of them got it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The same letter. And on a Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But did you tell us how much what was the dollar increase?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was 170 for me. The man in black is 200. And the guy on the side, I don't know, he wouldn't give them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Amount, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker, Garfield came across and then John Spangler. And then John Sullivan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, city council members and mayor. Staff members and. People in the audience. I'd like to thank all the. Support that I've received.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city. Last year I applied to the RAC with about 30 other tenants and we received a. A recommendation that that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lowered the rent from a 25% increase down to a 10%. Increase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of course, most of us had the. Had the eye on the horizon that this would occur again, which it has, and we received yet another rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But there were people in in the units this year that had to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Leave because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They got to rent increases and they did not apply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To the rack. So that is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sort of a problem is like I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Have to go to the rack to to maybe get a recommendation that will try to quell the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A desire by these landlords or by my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Landlord or a land management company, you know, to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Raise it more. You know, again, you know, it's like, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To get away with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'More because I guess the state allows that. But anyway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I'm going to get more to the point of me standing here and I support the Ordinance A. And support the Alameda Renters Coalition position on that proposal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For an ordinance. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Spangler, John Sullivan and then Karen Bass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. Members of the council and staff. First, I want to say how much I appreciated hearing Debbie Potter give a staff report. I have missed that. She is very good at what she does and it's always a pleasure to hear the thorough reports that she offers to this body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second, I as a member of the Steering Committee of Al Mehta Riders Coalition, I want to reiterate, we are not opposed to all rent increases. We understand that landlords are trying to make some amount of money that's on a positive balance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we commend the people who are providing housing, especially the local landlords who are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Providing housing to a great number of people. I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They and we oppose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The egregious increases that we've seen of 30% in successive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Years. That sort of thing, which is not just apocryphal, it's not a rumor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's why we have supported this ordinance. We support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I personally support ordinance A.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With no threshold because there is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No other place for renters to go. And most renters are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Facing declining incomes or stable incomes, not rising incomes. As Councilmember Desai presented in January to this body, the census data that he's able to find shows an increasing disparity in incomes between the two groups.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ordinance A maintains the status quo. There is no current threshold. There has been no flood of applicants to to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The RAC, as has been feared and stated by some landlords. We don't anticipate any change in that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to also say that I appreciate Councilmember Ashcroft's points. And I believe Councilor Odey also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mentioned earlier the 60 day eviction notice issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that the RAC will be able to address that through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Further research in this by this body and by. The city staff so an ordinance can be crafted to add to the the tax authority.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that it does have the chance to deal with that. In addition to issues of the physical condition of rental.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Units that are substandard and other issues that renters are dealing with in Alameda. But we like what we see tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We appreciate your support for Ordinance A with no threshold. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Dan Sullivan and then Karen B.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But evening Mr. Spencer. Members of the council and staff. I'm John Sullivan and. Appreciate you. Take a look at the take a look at the hand out it. It's fairly brief. And essentially, I would be leaning towards, you know, Proposition B, I guess it is Ordinance B or whatever, what to a few, you know, minor changes and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'number one, I guess would be the trigger and that the trigger to be at the 10%. And understand that there are many years when there is no possibility of an increase. And you've we've we've demonstrated that in a lot of literature that has been handed out to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One other item if a tenant avails the tenant can, of course we recognize that they can avail of the conciliation service. And if they do that, if a tenant does that and decides not to go along with the recommendations of the conciliator.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did say there should be no right of appeal in that case because the tenant that's been given one chance should be no right of appeal up to the board. An excellent section 6.56. That was talk of a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somewhere in the audience there. It's specified that the the landlord should call the tenant. There should be something in there that would reverse also that the tenant should contact the landlord before moving forward. And now number six, 56.10.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Amid the one year penalty and this kind of barters on rent control, really, there could be some liability, I think, for the city. And remember remember that if. That the landlord has to wait through the 30 or 60 days anyhow before he can really notice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So he is he is being penalized in that respect. No. The last one, I think is a no brainer mandating the city of residency that a landlord cannot be a member of the review board unless he lives in the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's a. I say that's absurd. Really, I believe. And, you know, he pays taxes, real estate taxes. He provides good housing in the city. He employs managers and so forth, who must live in the city that pays payroll taxes and whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And. And yet he's denied a voice. You might say. I think that doesn't you know, that doesn't really add up. One thing. My kind of a pet. The duration of mine. Is that last one there, the excessive 15% or more rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's an attachment which you've all seen already. But please go through it again, if you would. I really feel that where we are. Not helping a lot of the tenants by. By turning away from this and not taking action.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I and there's the question that, well, I'm asking you for extra notice to be give like hundred and 22 notice or longer to help the tenants. And maybe that's against state law which states 60 days notice but at least maybe in the interim.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Get it in? Yes. In documented in the ordinance that it be part of the recommendations from the city council to the rent review board that they consider and. Asking suggesting that the if the rent increase so be, you know, be at least to rent increase in order to be at least a double of the time of six'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It is 120 days notice. I really feel that somebody somebody somewhere has to, you know, step out of the box and address that issue. It is very serious. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Karen Bay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Members of the City Council staff. I'd first like to thank Geoffrey Canada and all of the members of the community that came together, the tenants and landlords that came together to create this compromise. And that's what this is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's a compromise. Everybody's giving up something. And that said, I'm here to support Ordinance B, I think there should be a threshold. With all of the increases that landlords have faced over the last years with parcel taxes and school taxes and fees that are going up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that it's a given that our expenses are going up and that those some of those expenses need to be passed on. Also, the survey that was done, if I recall, I renewed hope most of the increases that have been given or that were within the 5 to 10% range so that very few people have given'",
        "'speaker_10': '30%, 20% increases. So we're talking about a small group of people. And I just. Don't feel comfortable. Punishing a small. Punishing all landlords for actions and behaviors of a small group. The Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act exempts any form of rent control on single family homes, condos and new construction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So most of the landlords that will be affected by this ordinance are small mom and pop owners, many of which purchased their properties to. Purchased their properties as retirement income as they move into their later later years. And I fit in that category.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So with this ordinance, we will not solve the regional housing crisis, but this is a great, good faith effort to address some of the concerns. And I believe that while I believe that the shift needs to be to focus on really getting to the core of the problem and solving the problem, we're not Wal-Mart.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're not a corporation. We're we're our neighbor. We're neighbors, we're friends with small business owners. And the idea that with that, that a small group of people are being asked to carry the burden, the full burden of this regional housing crisis, I think is unfair.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So, again, I'd like us to shift hopefully this ordinance passes tonight. I'd like and again, I'd like us to shift our attention on addressing the core problems, the lack of supply. A lot of the cities, Bay Area cities, have come up with some really creative ways to address the problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I hope we I look forward to having that conversation with you tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our final speaker, Katherine Pawlenty.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Aaron Council Counsel I wasn't going to speak, but there are a couple of issues that haven't been addressed that I feel are related to this issue, and that is the fact. That. I keep hearing how people are still finding housing and staying in Alameda and the very sort of poignant picture of the mother with her bed in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a garage and her daughter. They're stuck with me. And since my landlord, who has been very fair up until recently like bunnies but is talking about it, that she can get $1,000 more for the three bedroom that I rented.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From her four and a half.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Years ago. And she wanted a long term tenant. I wanted a long term rental to get my grandchildren through school, to stabilize them, because I've talked with property realtors. They're doing a very strict one third rent two ratio in terms of income.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So those of us I retired this past year, those of us on a fixed income, it is a serious downsizing. Me and the two teenage children, 13 and 15, boy and a girl. We would only qualify for a one bedroom at current rents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm I'm sorry I hear about the landlords talking about their expenses going up and all of this, but rents, I follow it closely. Rents have gone up 50% in only two years. And by Mr. Lindsey's and some of the property I attended one of the property owners meetings and they've done the statistical data.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They have a 20% turnover each year. They don't have to penalize the current tenants to this degree to be able to make their living, to make their profits. And everyone has had of the property owners have had tremendous increases in their property values.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'New people buying in at those property values know what the current rents are. Have are are buying in at that rate with full knowledge of the current values. So I feel like there is an informed group and there is a great deal of greed going on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what really distresses me is when the city this is a great mechanism to at least bring people together to talk to lower it. But what I'm hearing from the people that have gotten it and got their landlord to come down to 10%.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then they're getting another 10% and 13 months. So they're back up to it. I at the end of the year, within the 13th month. They've got that extra 10% on top of the 10%, another others. So it's going up over 20% in 13 months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's a pretty sad solution. But that's where we are currently. This rock, the the rock is doing good work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understand that it's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mediation, but all the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Power is with the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I understand all the limits that are encompassed with rent control of all the small groups that are kept out. So the mom and pop operations that need that income. But I really go back to my landlord and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I, before I moved in, agreed it would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be a long term rental. I want to keep the children in the school district. I'll do that if we have to move into a studio just to keep the community and Alameda. But don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please don't say that we've.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kept you know, that we're keeping people in housing. It's such a serious downsizing and it is a crisis and people are afraid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Council comments. Member Audie.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you for letting me go first, because I'm interested in hearing my colleagues on this. Usually we come to these meetings 99%, our mind's made up. So I'm still amenable to hearing what my colleagues have to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to make a couple of quick points. One, we're not doing rent control. I mean, this is not an ordinance that implements rent control. What we are simply doing is enhancing a program that we have in place now with, you know, we're just tweaking it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we're we're giving notice of it to tenants and we're requiring landlords to show up. And then we're having some repercussions if they don't show up or, you know, if no, their rent increases denied. So I some of the words that, you know, I've seen on Twitter and, you know, in the blogs and even tonight, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'know, are a little disturbing. And when there's no punishing of landlords with this process, you know, what we are considering today is not punitive in any way, shape or form. And. When. And on the flip side. As a tenant, I can feel the pain of everyone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But when a landlord is giving a rent increase, they're not penalizing a tenant. Now, if they are penalizing you, that's retaliatory eviction. You take on the law or take them to court and sue them. And then if they really are penalizing you, then they'll be found.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They'll be found to be retaliated against you. So I think that. It's important to know that this is a mediation process. And thank thank you, Jeff, for all the hard work on that. We should try to find ways where we could work together and collaborate and not use the loaded words like penalize and loaded words like like'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like punish. So those are things I wanted to say, first of all. Second of all, I said this when we first talked about this, and there it is in the first whereas clause in the ordinance. Whereas there was a strong demand for rental housing in the city of Alameda, which which demand may result.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's a little bit awkward, but, you know, which may result in a shortage of rental housing. And that's. Now that's the situation we have. We have a supply issue of housing here in Alameda. And my personal feeling it's not going to be fixed by rent control.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not going to be fixed by, you know, having an enhanced and better rack process. It's going to be fixed by addressing the supply issue. And I encourage all of you that are here today, you know, that are suffering from this this shortage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, to come out when we have when we consider other projects like Side A and other projects that will help alleviate that supply. So. I was supportive of this process, supportive of the results that came through. You know, right now, my concern about putting in a threshold is that we're taking one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're taking away rights that tenants already have today. There is no threshold. You have a 5%, 2%, 10%, whatever it is. You can go and avail yourself of the process. I'm concerned that if we add a threshold, then you are depriving certain people, certain tenants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I don't know if it's due process, equal protection. We'll leave that up to the city attorney to decide. But I'm worried if you're basically denying access to a process that we have in place to help mediate rent disputes and rent increases to certain people just because the number is not at a certain threshold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's what I'm concerned about. I'm interested to hear my colleagues thoughts on this as well. And I do believe and this is what we've been asking for since I before I was even here in October, was the data to see the extent of the issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if if the issue is, you know, more than anecdotal, I understand, you know, it's pain for people and it's real when you're the one on the receiving end of the notice. But, you know, I'd rather make a decision based on a study than, you know, what I what I see on Twitter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I've been in favor of moving forward with with gathering the data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you very much. Just a quick comments for right now. I'll have more to say. I think from the outset I've always said that. I want to have our official bodies that we have empowered to deal with housing related issues, in particular the Rent Review Advisory Board to weigh in on the subject matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And. And to their credit, they have. And particular issue that they've certainly made comments on have to do with the threshold. You know, I've heard that from what property owners have to say, I heard about their concerns. I've also heard about concerns raised by by the tenants and the and in organizations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I was what I was reading. And those are all important input. But what I have always been looking forward to hearing is what the Rent Review Advisory Board has said, and they're the people who we entrust to deal with this matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And and I'm impressed with the time and thoroughness that they that they gave to this project. And one of their advice is, you know, no threshold. You know, and I know that pains the the property owners to hear that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But. But it is an advice, too, from coming from people who I ask for their advice. So on that score, my ruling is I can live with Ordinance A in that if it has no other because it comes from the review advisory boards recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amber Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Mary Spencer. First of all, thank you to everybody for informing us with your comments. And also, I was gratified to see Victoria Johnson from our Housing Authority meet up with them. What is the tenants we heard from about her?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Notice that's how Alameda responds to our residents in need immediately. Thank you, staff. You do a great job. And I want to also disclosed that I have met with representatives of the landlords groups, representatives from the Alameda Renters Coalition and Mr. Camber, who did a great job in bringing these different groups together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also favor the ordinance, say, as the RAC has weighed in and suggested we follow, because I like to keep things simple when you can. We have plenty of complications that we deal with all the time. So why added if we have if we don't have to?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is no threshold now and the process seems to be working quite well. I think the biggest issue was lack of awareness and I think that will be cured by requiring that a notice of rental increase include the language of the availability of the the process and to the by the way, I would go one step further'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and actually require that information about the availability of RAC services be included with every lease that is executed in Alameda. So that's something to consider as far as there was some worry and correspondence I think from some landlords about frivolous claims being brought.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The one of the things in its document that the RAC does is to take into consideration take financial hardship into consideration, which is another reason not to set a threshold, because what someone's financial hardship might be, you know, might might rise even before a 10% threshold is met.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the same time, I think it's important to understand that you might bring your case before the RAC and still not get the resolution you have hoped for. But what we're trying to do is bring all the parties to the table.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think we accomplish this with the with the penalties that would ensue if if either the landlord I know I'm not supposed to say landlord, the housing provider or the tenant does not come to the proceedings. But once we find that, once you get people face to face in the same room, by the way, I don't'",
        "'speaker_6': 'favor telephone conferences, but actual face to face meetings, you have a greater likelihood of resolving the situation, but not at all times. And I agree with my colleagues. I think Mr. Odey stated that it is a matter of supply and demand and I'll touch on that too.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I But I do think that the lack of threshold has worked so far, and I think that our RAC and you know, we are going to bring some new faces, some fresh perspective in although the other has been doing a great job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I just think it's, you know, should operate the way any board and commission does in the city. I think they're more they take their charge seriously and I think they're more than equal to the task. One question I do have and this goes to my, again, fervent desire for a consultant and to gather objective data for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'us is I really would like to know, first of all, how many rental units in Alameda would be covered by this ordinance because there are certain criteria. How many of these units are owned by Alameda residents? How many are owned by out of town, out of state owners?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the reason I ask that is that I've heard it both ways. I've heard that the majority of our rental property owners are Alameda residents. I've heard that the majority are out of town residents. And if we're relying on the presumption that somehow this informal, you know, local landlords putting pressure on local landlords not to make an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'excessive rent increase is to have wait. Then if more than half or at least half of our landlords are out of town representatives, shouldn't they have a seat at the table too? We've got two landlord seats. One of them could be held by an out-of-town landlord and that's something I think a consultant could look into.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What is the currency vacancy, current vacancy rate for rental properties? And again, I'd like to see that broken down by size of unit type of unit. How many renters have faced rent increases above a certain percentage in 2013 and 2014 who were forced out of Alameda and then to quickly jump.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Two other things we need to do, because as with just about any serious problem this body, the city council faces, there is no one magic solution. Trust me. If there was, we'd be, you know, we'd be going after it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think it's going to take a combination of ideas. Of course, we need to simply add more housing stock, but we don't do that overnight. But we have some some good potential in the pipeline. I think we also need to explore ways to increase the number of affordable units, even from some of our existing housing stock'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And some of you may have heard, I want to say last week on KQED FM, there was a great forum moderated by Michael Cat. Michael Krasny the it talked about Oakland and people being displaced by gentrification and rising rents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the panel members was Libby Schaaf and some of her staff, and there was a reference to section 236 tax exemptions, housing authority people. I'm looking at you because I haven't had a chance to do research, but this has to do with this is the state tax code and landowner landlord being able to get a property'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tax exemption for committing that for 35 years. That property would be used for low income rentals exclusively in low income as defined in state code. And there was a landlord who was quoted in in this forum that had voluntarily come forward to the mayor and said, I'm doing this with my building and here's how it's done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've also heard some creative ideas floated in the community. I've bounced them around off of city staff. In the real estate community, no unanimity. But one possibility would be the city could consider waiving the transfer tax on a purchase of a new rental property for a number of years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In exchange for that property owners agreement to to hold rent increases at a certain level and perhaps for certain criteria of renters, seniors, disabled, low income. But then someone else is city official in another city suggested I mean, we're all very possessive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, if that's okay. Oh, I'm saying. Do you need to do that? Okay. Okay. You want to figure out my sentence? Okay. So instead of because we are concerned with our revenue to our general fund and that's where transfer tax goes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This particular city official suggested the council could decide to set aside a portion of their general fund revenues to be used as a forgivable loan for some of these rental income property owners who are facing increased taxes, increased costs when they buy new property, if, again, for a certain period of time, they would agree to holding the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'grants at a certain certain rate and for certain classes of renters. And again, this is something that should be explored by staff and perhaps a consultant. But just the point I'm trying to make is there are some other creative solutions we're all going to have to look at to help address this very real problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sorry, Mayor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So this at 1030, we would need a motion to consider remaining agenda items, which are six F, 66 H, nine and ten A and our clerk. Could you share the importance of six F and six G?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you. Six F and six G are required to be adopted tonight if the notice is going to go out with the business license. Otherwise, they would have to individually fill every one as an extra step. That would be quite consuming.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm willing to go.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really consider other items then.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then. Would that be to address the balance?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The balance, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Second, all those in favor. My motion passed unanimously. Thank you. You make sure you finish.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I wanted to point out that two things that both of these ordinance do, they put what's in one of the whereas is in a little more concrete and that's fair and reliable process to resolve disputes. And our main at least my main mission is looking for something that ensures fair treatment of the difference.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Between what is before and what is in front of us now is also adding the Section 2.23. That's the creation. Of the Rent Review Advisory Committee. I think that's important also to make sure that we we do. And then lastly, on the order of a threshold amount, I'd like to see no threshold amount because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's any number of reasons why a smaller percentage might be a tipping point or egregious. Just as much as a larger percentage that hadn't been preceded by any any increases might be considered a fair and a fair increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the Rent Review Advisory Committee would have the charge of evaluating each case individually without the constraint of a of a threshold. And also tenants will have the same rights that they currently have under the current process. I support Ordinance A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. But I speak real quick. Okay. I wanted to speak more so with regards to your warehouses. The first paragraph. There is strong demand for rental housing in the city of Alameda, which demand may result. I think we could strike that second demand which may result in the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I agree with them. If I had trouble reading the third paragraph, the sentence reads Whereas when housing providers have information about a rent increase, when that rent increases have, I think there should be rent increase. Singular has worked a financial hardship.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I caught that later and they've got it. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, and in regards to this, it is this is something that the tenant has to prove that it is a financial hardship. I'm not sure why this is actually here. When I went in. When that rent increase has worked I financial hardship on the tenant and someone else because that suggests to me that it was a that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the tenant must show a financial hardship in order to bring this. And I'm not sure that that's actually currently what happened to that rack. Looks at the individual person's income and expenses to determine of make a finding to that effect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would think that that language should be stricken so that we're not in the position of asking our rack to make a finding to that effect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If I may just get some clarification so we can help. So first of all, these are whereas this they're not. So they're just kind of setting the stage for what the reasoning is for putting this ordinance into effect that in following what you're trying to say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Manama I guess my only question would be just any rent increase is not necessarily going to mean that they have to avail a tenant would have to avail themselves of this process. So I think the intention was to try to say if there's a rent increase that the tenant believes is unfair or they have a problem meeting'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that financial burden, then this is something that they can they can pursue. So I think that's what we were trying to get out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would suggest language should be modified to something to that effect as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just just along those lines, if you look on to the duties of the committee at the end, it it does include that. After hearing the parties and taking into consideration such factors as the financial hardship to the tenant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that the initial language is consistent and I would at want to hear whatever modifications are before I. Agreed to approve this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry, Councilmember. I didn't understand where you were looking. That there's some additional language.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'm just looking at the duties, then, of the rack. I'm sorry. Which are in the last page.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The two dash 23.4.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Manu, Mayor, are you suggesting you don't think financial hardship on the tenants should be considered then, is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I think that is this is a factor that says such factors as in regards to the duties. So tenants do sometimes come and speak to that and share that. I think you're rare as however it says very clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It says when that rent increase has worked, a financial hardship as opposed to being part of a list. So I think there's a difference between the two and I'd like to be able to continue my comments at this point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was just trying to understand what you were just in the ultra.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually the council suggested some language in the alternative. Or she'll come back the. In regards to the as that paragraph continues and speaks to a committee of residents representing housing providers. And I support that language and I appreciate concerns from landlords that live outside of our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However. Everyone up here. We all are required to live here. A school board. Everyone's required to live here in the city of Alameda. Every commission we do make decisions that impact people outside of our community. All, all of the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they are always for every commission that is a requirement to reside here in the city of Alameda. I don't think not. Which commission?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Transportation Commission allows it to be people who have businesses here and then also be a school district representative who's not required to necessarily live in town. They work at the school district. So it's sometimes work here, too, just in a very small case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So I would say that for me personally, I can I actually think it should always be residents. That's that's what I'm used to here at the council level and at the school board level who make the. Really?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The decisions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sorry. Are you reading for membership? I'm having trouble.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a row now, referring to the third. Whereas on here it says a committee of residents. I want to speak to that. And that's something that's come up. That's just my position. I think maybe other people are don't want that included there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They want to remove the committee of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I like it as is, but other people have spoken to that. So I just want to just make it clear it's here. It is here. So if we want to have this, I think that whenever you have suggested this be research.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I'm suggesting that that it might be something data we'd want to look into with the consultant. It's something to consider. I know, for instance, in the city of San Leandro, they have one landlord member who's a resident owner and one who is not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I yeah. And again, I'm I'm open to hearing what the council as a body feels about that. But I also feel like I don't have enough information at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And that paragraph continues, a neutral form for a tenant to voice a concern about the rent increase. And I'd like to add. And the housing provider to respond. The other. The flip is if that is not provided here and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My major concern with this is and we had a speaker speak to this Pastor Hawkins, it intent it excludes certain landlords from rent control. And I'm and I would like a legal opinion in regards to can we establish that one of those types of owners, such as someone that someone that rents a family residence, would be excluded'",
        "'speaker_0': 'under Costa Hawkins. Then can we establish that they must provide this notice? And if in fact they don't appear under 6-5, 7.3, it says, then any rent increase, accomplished violation of this shall be void. I, I would question whether or not we can make an ordinance that would make a rent increase invalid for a landlord that owns'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a single family house or any other type of housing that is excluded under California state law under Costa Hawkins from rent control. I would ask that that be looked at before we have a mandatory panel. Making anything mandatory for those owners that are excluded under Costa Hawkins.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Desai.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Madumere, are you finished right now? Because I have three points that I want to address, but I can wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Although I just want to make sure. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Okay. My three quick points are in terms of out of town representation on the wrap. I concur. Again, I defer to the recommendation put forward by the Rabb regarding making residents. I hear the concerns of of the of the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But from my perspective, two issues. One, property owners have been active on the RAB process. So I think their their views are well, well included. And the second thing is that, you know, it's a recommendation coming from the RAB on whom I've relied quite a bit on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Second issue is on funding this. Earlier we had passed the previous thing that allowed for roughly 60, 60, $77,000, which really isn't much to to help this process. While I'm not going to pursue this tonight. One of the things I do want to report on earlier today is I figured, well, you know, since I do rent out'",
        "'speaker_9': 'two rooms, I should I should get by, as I indicated or some earlier today. I should get a business license. It turns out that because I it's my owns, it's a single family home because it's a single family home.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And even even as I ran out two rooms and even as I, you know, include that in any of my tax returns, you know, business deductions, blah, blah, blah, but I am not required to pay the $20 business license per room.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's something that we might think about in the future as a possible revenue source. I calculate that if given the number of single family homes that are renting rooms, I calculate roughly, you know, $56,000. I mean, not much, but maybe enough to cover.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. The third point is on the issue of Costa Hawkins, not only on the point raised by the mayor tonight, but I thought I heard a possibility of some legal action regarding against the Ordinance A or B, in which case maybe one language that's missing from the ordinance right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that we always use some kind of severability clause, maybe because I don't think I see that in here. So it's something that we need. I think we should contemplate that if some portion or one particular part of the ordinance is subject to the courts and in fact loses, and that doesn't mean everything else is is'",
        "'speaker_9': 'moot. I mean, so that's I would hope get direction from the council on that. Thank you. Those are my three points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. In regards to the 35,000 for the consultant the consultants report. I would be interested in knowing. The type, the percentage of how of rentals that are excluded under Costa Hawkins. What percentage of rentals here in Alameda fall under Costa Hawkins in which that would not be eligible for any type of rent control?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because for me, the reason why I've been strongly supporting this is that I see it as a way to best try to address. The highest percentage, if not all, rentals within the community and under Costa Hawkins, we there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's actually a significant percentage of rentals that would be excluded under a mandatory rent control. And and then that goes to my earlier concerns in regards to anything that is mandatory for those units. I think this works because I think this goes to addressing all renters within the city because it is voluntary and that's that'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So then that's my concern. And then for me, my focus in regards to in addition to what units would be excluded is the effectiveness of these changes. Once we move forward with this, how effective they are, the type of renter, you know, if we can figure out how many renters are actually receiving the notice, if it's impacting'",
        "'speaker_0': 'if they feel at that point that it's addressing the concern as successful, almost like an exit from the the rack and exit interview from rack and see if they if, you know, if they think it's working. And also any comments from the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that I actually think that the result would be to continue to strengthen rec moving forward as a voluntary effort that then addresses the needs of, I think, all renters within the city of Alameda. Yes. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'May I just ask you for clarification? I was trying to take notes, Madumere when you were talking about trying to address or assess the whether the majority of rentals wouldn't be subject to rent control. You're not proposing rent control.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're just trying to see if we can bring them all under the umbrella of this voluntary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my concern is that when that or when we're looking at this profile of rental market market conditions. There. It would include an increase in rent across the board. And it may suggest then that we as a council could make changes that would go to addressing all of those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's so for me, it's important to recognize that Costa Hawkins, by definition, would exclude and I think a major significant number of the rentals. So that I think it's important to strengthen the rec. And I'm not suggesting rent control, which is does not address all the rental industry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just kept hearing you say it. But so so you're saying you'd like that quantitative data as well? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's because I think it's very important that the community and we understand at most we so this for me, this is very important that this be voluntary so that we can address all the concerns and any data in regards to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to know what percentage of rentals would always be excluded under rent control. Costa Hawkins.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that's actually where the benefit to our entire community comes from by doing a voluntary BRAC. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So, just so I understand. So on. In the tasks of the scope of work for the study, you'd like to see a number that says under Costa Hawkins, these number of units and maybe which ones are single-family, which ones are built after?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think after 79 or whatever it is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Known, and if I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I can clarify that it's Costa Hawkins basically will apply it and we are not doing rent control, let's make this clear. But it's four units built prior built prior to 1995 and they are duplexes or apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They are not single family homes, they are not condominiums. They are not anything that is separate parcels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it's my understanding apartments built after 95 cannot have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right control and the rent control under Costa Hawkins applies to duplexes, apartment buildings built prior to 1995.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Maybe the so is the gist of through the chair or to the chair is the gist of your question. If the council at this council or some other council were to consider rent control, think quantity, quantifying what number of units is the universe that might be subject to it and which ones would be exempt regardless'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of whatever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Because at the end, I think we're going to end thinking that rack is. Well, I think that that's information. I would like to know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I mean, I have no problem with that. But I do. You did raise a point earlier that maybe this is a closed session, maybe this is something in public. But, you know, are we going to run afoul of Castro Hawkins with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't think we are because this is not rent controlled. But are we going to run afoul of it with this rent ordinance? And maybe given that there's some threats of litigation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, there's actually a side. So my concern is that it's not it's a it says that the rent increase would be void if if these measures are not taken. And I don't understand how if we could not apply rent control under Costa Hawkins to a certain rental.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How can we say a rent increase is void?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we probably are getting into some legal issues that maybe it is best if council wants me to come back, we'll have to not take action on this. You're asking a number of legal questions. We can go back and look and come back with some information for counsel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess one thing I would ask, though, listening to you, Madam Mayor, is you're saying you don't want to do these kinds of things, but you want to strengthen the rack. And I guess I'm not sure how we strengthen the rack.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was the intent of this, trying to find ways to strengthen the rack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my question first to you is that I need to know if this is legal that's being presented to us to approve. And I don't believe that they should. And so I'm asking you to to come back and let us know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can come back and look at these specific questions, but I can tell you that we didn't bring you something that we thought I missed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, well, that was my question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor, I think. Vice Mayor, when the Mayor pointed this out, I read it differently because I was reading sections 6.57.3 as providing. The tenant. With a tool. To use as evidence in their case. And that is proceeded though, and you could read it the other way that's preceded that this ordinance would void a rent increase, which is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'rent control. So how do you reconcile? That's the question that is there wording that can reconcile it but still provide the tenant with the protection that's intended here. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm hearing you and we will have to come back. I can't I've tried to do things sitting here and I can't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I'm just saying what I. I think the question is, again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The one thing that I might point out is that. If the if the rent increase is not valid because it wasn't properly noticed under our ordinance, if the property owner then notices it properly, they can move forward with the rent increase so that it's it's not a permanent bar.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you properly notice pursuant to the ordinance, then the rent increase can be imposed. However, it is true that the way the ordinance is structured that if there is a failure to participate in the hearing, you are barred from increasing rent for 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you have the ability to care, that you have an ability to prevent that from happening by participating in the process. And I would say that there are several jurisdictions San Leandro, the county of Alameda, there are other jurisdictions that have these requirements on their books.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that we were really looking to best practices when we did our research on these ordinances. So we're not in a completely unchartered territory. There are jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I wouldn't it's not, you know, if it's being challenged legally by a landlord.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It has not. Right, John? There's been no challenges in San Leandro or the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I was sitting on a school board. Right. So so I can tell you my experience of sitting on a school board and having a case go up and be challenged and the school district losing. So I really appreciate this being thoroughly vetted at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor, of the continued.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Scrutiny.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I. I do concur with your thoughts echoed by Councilmember Daisuke about the composition of the the board. Maybe I'm a little parochial here, but I think it should be Alameda, INS and Alameda only. But that's my thought is are we able to move this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May I. Sounds like we have a consensus on at least A versus B. Yes, I support move this or do we want to move this. I think because we remember we did the the the we the but we knew that we had a second reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we had an opportunity to and not approve the second reading if we didn't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't support moving forward at this time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilmember o.T We can't do that because he's got too many things that are just asking. Yeah, no, I appreciate it. But what we, what we have to do is we have to have pretty solidly what the ordinance is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to have a tweak, which is all we did in the Wheaton matter, was just one one week.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So so maybe the motion that there has to be one tonight should just be picking between A and B and then subject to the concerns raised by the mayor and other council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I well, I don't know how far we can go. I think what I would want to see is that we make sure we're giving staff, particularly the city attorney, clear direction on what points we want researched and brought back to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So given I mean, we could say we just want you to study Ordinance A, because that's the that's the will of this body. But I'm not sure we can do much more than that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It'd be more efficient if we didn't have to rewrite two ordinances. If we knew we were leaning one way that you only rewrite if necessary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is there. Was there anyone that's on council that supported me? Option B, no. Okay. So then I think your.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Direction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the direction that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'America. Yes. There are two other points of consensus. One is that we were going to give direction and there was a laundry list of data that we want give direction on the other half of this recommendation to go ahead with the study.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's independent of the actual wording here. Yep. And to my way of thinking, nonresidents should not be on the on the rack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we have a consensus. I go to residence Iraq.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to see it go forward with resolution of this issue of Costa Hawkins. And does this constitute. What it would affect. Does it have particularly a6-5? 3.5, 7.3?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And keep residents an option. And thank you. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just for the benefit of the folks who are listening in who might not have taken real property in law school. Can you just cause to Hawkins tell us briefly what it is to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That I'm sorry, it's almost 11 another because you have the motion to extend the meeting beyond 11.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you. You may. Can you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just. So we're not talking in code to the public. Costa Hawkins is the name of, I think to legislators who.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just generally speaking, it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it basically is. And please feel free to add what you you want. But but Costa Hawkins is rent. It's the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which is in California's civil code 1954.50 at SEC. So anyone who wants has on their Internet, whatever can look it up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is a law that was passed by the state legislature which authorizes limited rent control provisions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So maybe I will motion. I'd like to do this into one to prove the staff recommendation to do the study on the impacts of rising rents on Alameda residents. With the extra data point that the mayor suggested.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there are suggestions from. Their Council member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brother data points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm open to friendly amendments and the motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, they were. They were in the record. Do you want me to read them again or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I take the staff. Me?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think we. I think we have them. Unless you all wanted to vote on them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is that. Does that need to be a motion? A direction?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the direction is fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's direction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I guess the question I would have, do you want the study information to come back at the time we come back with the redrafted ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I don't. I think staff is saying it'll take about six months and I will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's why I want to know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I don't to my personal views.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Get the ball rolling on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It. Yeah, my personal opinion is the meaning of the ordinance doesn't doesn't require that we have the data. But I think the council and we need this data moving forward. So and I'm told by staff it'll take about six months to complete the study anyway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm looking for data. I want to clarify moving forward to how successful I want to make sure you heard that not just Garth Hawkins, but how successful when I think how successful RAC has been feedback about RAC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, we don't need to study for that though, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That no, we'll do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Internal staff can gather those numbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So then I'll amend my motion to, you know, authorize the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Direction you just said give any direction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, don't we have to approve the study or. No, we're good. Then I'll give direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mostly direction. All of us.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay then. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll stop talking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So my understanding is we can now move on to the next agenda item. The six f.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What can we put a summary for people watching? What do we do with the ordinance? When is it coming back?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, good point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe June ten time is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are we doing any?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We asked the city manager. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would you like to give us that? You have information gross to when you expect us to come back at this point?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well on the study, I think about six months. But the ordinance the ordinance ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When when can we calendar this ordinance again? How much time a city attorney need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we have extra meetings?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No regular meetings.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'So Council wanted to know when we could come back with the newly revised proposed ordinance along the lines of the ordinance A and we believe we can do it before you break or four August, so we hope to get it to you in July.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I do not.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I would think you confirm it by knowing what their gross revenue is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The surcharge is a flat rate.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'That the surcharges supplied based on the square footage?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the surcharge is based on the square footage. So okay, so they get the 4000 plus they pay the $0.40. Her gross revenue. So and we don't independently verify the gross revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We. We do. Based on the gross revenue. And then according to the the fee schedule, there is a cap, a maximum of four area A of $1,967. And so if you have that maximum plus the 4000. Surcharge, the total maximum for.'",

There's been a progressive unfavorable sentiment among business owners against Waba due to their lack of their efforts to promote Webster Street businesses.

Obviously, I have a long list of activities that the association does, which you already you already have been notified on through the staff reports.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'll just touch on the specifics as far as, uh, transparency. All the staff, me, all the board meetings of the association are open to members. And we do distribute paper copies of the financial reports at every board meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So any board member is allowed to attend the board meeting or any member is allowed to attend the meeting and get to get copies of the financial reports. And if they had questions on those financial, they could be discussed at the board meeting or through email with follow up conversations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As far as contributions to events like the Jam and the Crab Coe, we feel that we are. If I were one organization, a nonprofit, why would we contribute to promoters holding events in our district? We used to hold these events, but due to staff shortage, we don't hold them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's no point in us contributing to promote the events that are being held by promoters. We have our own events. We just had a successful wine and dine event. We had the Christmas event, the Halloween event. We are monthly mixers and so we don't feel that contribution to promoted events is the best way to use the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'funds. As far as uh, the board being, uh, uh, you know, entrenched, you know, we have elections every year. We have given prior notice of the elections. We encourage board members. I personally go down the street and meet as many people as I can to encourage them to be on the board.'",

In fact, you know, we've had two recently we've had two new board members in the current term, which started in January.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the board is, you know, members can join the board based on their participation. So it's not like the board is not changing every year. Also, we have a staggered term there. Every board member or two board members, you know, they go off the board every three years so that you don't have where, you know, you can'",
        "'speaker_3': 'bring in an entirely new board, which is not helpful to the association. And as far as the other issues go, um. We've been doing all the marketing programs that we've committed to. We've done the banner program recently, and the funds of the association are being used.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As you may know, one question has been the results of the association. Well, that's why the results for for rainy day, you know, for for emergencies. But the results have not accumulated due to recent years of by contributions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They were accumulated when we had the redevelopment initiative comments. So if you have any more questions, please let me know and I can answer them or my staff can answer them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Like staff. I have a question. It says that a challenge. Assessments cannot be levied at protests or received by owners of businesses and their real pay. 50% or more of the assessment. As staff can staff tell me if Safeway and Target would exceed the 50% or what that looks like.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So. You. The. What was 2014 peer assessment was $52,292. Roughly $50,000. You just take Safeway and Target and just roughly around $12,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Except that's with the cap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My question is, so if you take off the cap. I cannot I don't have that figure with me. Okay.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Well, we wouldn't one. Effective removing the cap be. If we did just base safely in targets assessment solely on their gross revenues, wouldn't that just put them way out ahead of all the other business members and maybe make it less of an even playing field than I think we're trying to do?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I understand. I think I understand. I don't want to put words in your mouth, Madam Mayor, but you want us you want Webster's being to get as much assessment as possible. But on the other hand, it's of, you know, the voting rights hinge on your.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Out of the assessment.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I would have to see what the for the Almeida landing what the actual on. Our gross receipts are for each of the new businesses at Almeida Landing. These businesses are opening up now and at full buildout. It's hard for me to anticipate or estimate, you know, the calculation, but it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sounds like what the does basis on an estimate. For the new for the new businesses if I understand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The budget built.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So for new businesses, it's based on estimates. And even subsequently, businesses fill out the business license forms with numbers that they report. As you may know, a couple of years ago, we hired the city, hired a firm to audit business license reports, and then the process was not completed because I guess there was some backlash from'",
        "'speaker_3': 'businesses in the way that it was being conducted. So. It's true that businesses report based on estimates are based on their numbers. But going back to your question, I definitely think if you remove the cap and limit the lending would be contributing more to the RBA than the businesses on the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's very easy to see that with all the big businesses that are going in there or eventually will be there. But the cap is what makes it a level playing field.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that. Thank you. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mary Ashcroft, I think I have a question for Mr. Feinstein. Thank you, Mayor. So in your staff report down here in discussion on page two, it says that the fiscal year 20 1516 assessments cannot be levied if protests are received by the owners of businesses in the area, which will pay 50% or more of the assessment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Did you receive I think you said you got a phone call. Did you get a protest?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The phone call if you count that phone call that was upset about the assessment. If you include that with tonight's comment together, those two establishments make up 2.8% of the assessment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. So the answer would be you did not receive protests from owners of businesses in the area, which would pay 50% or more of the assessment. Okay. And you I think the previous paragraph outlines the. The. Steps you took to notice the public hearing and mailed notification to all BIA members and instructions on how to protest'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Right. We encourage the members of the bar to be actively involved in the governance in the in the governing bodies, to attend the meetings, to be part of the BIA board of directors, the business associations, the health of business associations really depends on a very active membership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we would encourage the members to be involved and to their own governance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what oversight does council have? City have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The oversight the city council has is through these public hearings and also has an agreement with WADA that was developed when in 1991. Now it's reporting requirements, it's meetings. So those are the type of oversight that the city has.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there is an agreement that the city has. So can that be looked at by staff to see if those things are occurring? And does staff do that? Is there the staff annually do that?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We, for example, and following up on its work plans, it has carried out the banner programs. Yes, we see. And we do follow up on the marketing activities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do you report back to council annually or is the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reporting it's done through the Business Association, through its annual report that it submits.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Separate from this, then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was included as exhibit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's what this is. Right. So this is when we would have the authority to exercise our oversight ability to discuss that. So has staff shown exactly what the responsibilities are under that agreement? That's the council where the oversight is by the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's my understanding there's an agreement between the provider and the oversight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The agreement was for that. The Business Association came forward with a report and the agreement states what's in the report that provides an accounting for the expenditures in the previous year and a budget for the next fiscal year.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I have long been concerned with our Webster Street West End business districts wanting it to be as thriving a business district, different but equally as successful as our Park Street business district. Although Webster Street has had its challenges and it was far more impacted by the base closure, and I think it's still coming back.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I hope individuals who don't like the way an organization is being run might step forward to help be part of that leadership. But be that as it may, if the this BIA assessment is a very important part of the economic viability of Webster Street, it allows it to do the kinds of things the street beautification, advertising of'",

Because even though it was characterized as, you know, promoters, I always think when I'm down there it's bringing people to the street. But I also get that you can only spread yourself so thin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And all of these business owners who serve on the board are also business owners. And so whatever they do, it's really a labor of love because they're there extending their business day and week to serve their business association.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I want to I really think over the last few years, we've seen new businesses open on Webster Street, some really exciting kind of organic, one of a kind type businesses, places to eat. And so I want to see that momentum continue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't want us to to throw any roadblocks. I think it's perfectly valid to to ask, you know, are you are you know, is the city doing everything it can to assist? And I do think our economic development, the Community Development Department, helps if there are some specific ways we can help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While this still further, I you know, I hope they'll let us know. But I, for one, hearing what I heard about the low percentage of business ownership that was represented in the protests, I would be prepared to make a motion that we consider adoption of this resolution.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So it has to be managed and I think the surcharge and cap is a good way to manage it. I think that we need to move forward and. Basically confirm the recommendation. And I think there's we've we've heard someone talk about the effectiveness of of the board and.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I. I have respect for the past practice. It seemed to work. And until I hear that, there's a problem. Think this is really a back burner item and at some point there is a problem, we can address it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think the issue of prepping and the issue of reporting back is how we how we manage this. And I'm not an informal way but in in a practice that seems to have served the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. My my feelings are pretty similar to what the vice mayor just expressed. You know, as far as part of the appointment, I mean that's I mean that's typically been the mayor's you know to the victor goes the spoils right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean. That's your job, your prerogative. And, you know, if somebody feels slighted, then, you know, try to make sure you have a relationship with the person who makes the appointments. I mean, I don't know what else to say about that one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The second one, you know, I'm a little bit concerned about, you know, the the direction, you know, given to us as we serve on these either as alternates or representatives and and making sure that, you know, we follow as our is we represent the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would think that we represent the policies that have already been adopted by the city. So I would be concerned if, you know, somebody was representing a different policy at one of these regional boards. And I think that was kind of the the impetus for for this referral was to make sure that, you know, say, for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'instance, on Acts, you know, that if if we have spoken as a community and we have spoken as a council to be supportive of something that our our representative represents us, you know, same with Waste Management Authority, you know, a bag and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then, you know, I know I've heard reports back from League of Cities, but, you know, I'm not recalling very many reports back out from from some of these other other regional boards and commissions. And I'd like to see something, you know, written down that, you know, there was a policy that, you know, we knew how we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'were directed to vote. And I you know, if the policy is that you agree to serve, then you agree to sit down with staff and go through the agenda. You know, maybe that's what it is. But I'd like to make sure that, you know, we're all fully briefed and fully prepped and that we're representing the city at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'these boards and commissions with the proper, you know, authority and proper positions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so to address something, Mr. Councilmember, what you just said and the to the victor goes the spoils. And if someone feels slighted, I didn't bring this because I felt slighted. I not that I was appointed, but I didn't feel slighted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But my concern was simply that these regional bodies are significant to our city in many ways, not least of which has to do with funding streams. So I feel that those are decisions that the entire council as a body will be held accountable for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would at least like as much say in and it really is just maybe a formality, but at least it's a way of bringing it to the public. And, you know, we're all about transparency up here. So that just like tonight, we considered the representatives for this East Bay Regional Parks Liaison Committee, and the public could'",
        "'speaker_6': 'see it in the public could, you know, hear who the appointments were. And, and it was from a referral from council member Vice Mayor Matariki. So I'm just saying I think that we should treat all of our appointments equally.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think they're all equally important and I think the implications of our service on a regional bodies could be even greater than, say, the Historical Advisory Board, which would at least come before the council. And I do agree with Councilman Brody's assessment about the importance of having just some oversight, not oversight, some direction in policy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is something I was saying the city attorney and I have had conversations about. There is some. But when it comes to the representative of the city serving on a regional board and carrying out the the will of the council, the will of the city, there is, I believe, some attorney general opinions, some case law, some'",
        "'speaker_6': 'other procedure that could be spelled out for the council so that we're just not not only the council, but the public is clear about that. And I, I don't think it has to be very long and involved, but I would like to see that done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would not support asking council to do more work at this time. I would support I agree with the member vice mayor's comments. On this entire item. And my only concern would be that the member that has brought this item served under the prior administration, and it's my understanding that this item was not brought at that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'time. And I do believe that the members of our council that serve on the Commission's report back on what I would consider issues significant to the city. And there are. So I support the prior practice in this entire regard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have one more comment. Vice Mayor I'd like to maybe address this to the Interim City Manager about the the assurance that when these regional bodies produce an agenda that someone has to attend, whether it's the primary or the alternate, that the practice is, I've been away for four years, but the practices that whether it's public works'",
        "'speaker_2': ', whether it's but most of the time it was public works or whether it's planning and community development for a bag that there's there's a briefing, it's done. And I experience this with CMA that no longer exist. That the city engineer sat down with me and said there was the vote in 2006 and now it's coming before SEMA'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And this is this is critical to the city to implement what we did. That's what I'm looking for. And is that something that happens? And can we be assured that it will continue?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not sure if it's happening right now. Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Well, let me out. So you serve on a transit liaison committee. Do you receive a staff briefing for it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Usually a staff person comes and we talk before we go. And that first meeting got postponed till July, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, so it sounds like you do all right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It hasn't happened yet. It did in the past.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The May the April meeting was canceled, so there was nothing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So do we send a staff meeting with the council?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I don't know. I don't know. So how about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Me? You know, sometimes. Yes, sometimes not. Sometimes staff. Depending upon what the items are, staff does brief, for instance, on waste management. And there is a change here in regards to our delegate our primarily is on now member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But staff does brief the representative on that item and attend a meeting and is very is always available during the meeting. League of Cities Member If you and I were there, I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually that it's Tony. Member Councilmember Desai is our representative. We just we attend the East Bay division meetings sometimes, but he's the actual.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, I meant the annual conference. That's that we just attended. I don't think. Go. Oh, all right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And you're the representative to that one?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. On that one, did you have staff? Staff. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think there are definitely sort of the thresholds of where when when staff attends and when they don't. And I think primarily it's when money is involved that we make sure that we're there. For example, waste management, particularly with rate increases.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'AC DC Obviously, I think that's absolutely critical, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll find out. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's right. Yeah. I think maybe the league California cities, you know, that's less of a I think I mean, if we have staff, I think that would be helpful. But it's also not as critical, I think, as the ones where there's money attached.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Although I will just add that staff, of course, doesn't attend the closed session.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct. And that's a good it's a good point. In regards to closed session, I'm not sure what report out we could do on items in closed session either.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I don't think that's a big deal usually. I mean, it's okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, it probably depends on what the item was, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if it's in closed session, I don't think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It can report it to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Yeah, I think that's the way I think council as a body would want to know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, so. Does that satisfy you in regards to. Your concern?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think a little more clarification wouldn't hurt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that up until now, I don't think we need to set up a committee now. We I think we have to you know, we have to make sure sign signees set. I just want to make sure that the briefings are done and people are reporting out after.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Well, I think if I heard Councilmember Desai correctly, you said earlier, just do the appointments. I mean, the appointments are obviously all made. So this is going forward. Do them the way we do our internal bodies just, you know, bring them out so the public can in No.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Two in the council can vote in. It's really a formality, but at least it's public.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I'm fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I so that there would be a change to require. Council to approve as much as what you're asking the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As much as we do. Any other appointment you make, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't support any change, as has been the practice and precedents, far as I know for the history of our city. And I would see.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what what I recall from the previous mayor, Mary Gilmore, is that she actually pulled the different members of the council asking their interest in particular serving on particular bodies. And then she made the appointments. But she, you know, she please check with us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we we knew where to put them. And then we got a list that was emailed to us showing us what our assignments were. So I'm just one it was just one of those areas where it was interesting to me that the the charter was silent about appointments to regional boards and commissions, and yet it prescribes the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'procedure for the internal ones. And again, to my point, I think the regional body parts are just as important to the public. And so, you know, I don't think we're asking for a major change.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And just I just want to make sure to say for the League of California Cities, you do have to get voted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Exactly that, because.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that's my impetus for this. I hear what you're saying, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do it like the league.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member comments? Mamelodi.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I'm not going to talk about the appointment process, but you know, just to echo the vice mayor directions and then that we also get some direction there, you know, on informing on what the city policy is in this area, if there is one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if there isn't one, well, then great. Tell us there isn't one. I mean, that's that's really all I was asking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there emotion? Hearing them moving.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well all our moves that we. Adopt the the recommendations that I've heard from. The. I think at least a majority that we use the same appointment procedure for regional boards and commissions as the League of California Cities prescribes in as we do for internal boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that we have some clarifications of what, if any, city policy we have towards with regard to representing city policy on a regional board and commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we could bifurcate those two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I'd like to move to to split the question on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Okay. So the first one is establishing the procedure for appointments to regional boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're a second.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll second because I don't think it will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I others oppose. No, oppose.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Abstain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But motion fails. Two in favor, two opposed and one abstention. The second part of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The second part is to have the city attorney come back to us with guidelines on what, if any, city policy we have. Or what city policy we might consider toward. Representation of city policies on regional boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll second that one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any comment? All those in favor I. Pose. Pose. Abstention. And one abstention. Motion carries three in favor. One opposed and one abstention. Thank you. Next item. Ten Council Communications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And a consideration of Magu's nomination for appointment to the Golf Commission, the Public Art Commission and the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners.'"
