    "Cancellation of the 2020 Fourth of July Parade.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'of what you're recommending and why. Sure. Thank you, Madam Mayor. The recommendation by staff is to cancel the 4th of July parade. We understand, as Councilmember Odie said, this is a very important part of our community, but it also draws 60,000 spectators across three miles of our island.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the safety, while it's important event, our community, the safety of our community is first and foremost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Otis point and question we are floating idea of even for the 4th of July of options of what we can do. Even just today, actually, one of my staff brought what I thought was a fabulous idea to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, a lot of people love decorating their homes here for a 4th of July. So we think we could potentially build a virtual event around people decorating or decorating windows, do some kind of contest, create a bike walk map of all of the people participating, have some kind of voting mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we still can do something fun for the 4th of July. I think it's an event of that scale is extremely difficult to pull off. And, you know, it needs to be you need at least 3 to 4 months to to to coordinate an event like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with the potential of next wave and things like that, it makes it really difficult to to plan a future event on that scale. It's actually an in-person parade, but we will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Continue to explore options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we look thinking this was if we look forward to hearing more from you and, you know, to our residents, we, um, we know what a popular event this is. And, and of course, we just, you know, it breaks our hearts to have to cancel it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would break my heart more to see our rate of COVID 19 increasing. And there's just no way responsibly that the governor would even let us invite 60,000 people over for a little parade. But, um, Alameda does it right, and we'll figure out a way to do something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you so much, Ms.. Aldridge. We'll look forward to just hearing more from you. So with that, we've had a motion by Council member Odie to accept the the staff recommendation to cancel the 2024 parade. And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, I'll second with a quick comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. And if you just want to wait for the previous speaker myself in this case to finish and then I will call on you with your hand up. And so. Mr. Dysart.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great, thank you. I think the cancelation of such a cherished event as the 4th of July parade only underscores the dire situation. Alameda and all of us across the world, in fact, are in with this COVID 19. So I think it is right and fitting that that we make this cancelation, however sad this makes us all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. The motion has been moved and seconded. Any further discussion from Council Councilmember Vela? I just wanted to thank all of our staff for their work on this and for our Parks and Rec and Park Department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that you're constantly trying to come up with different alternatives for us in so many different ways, for so many different things. I love the idea of like a porch contest or something like that in terms of decorating and getting people into the spirit of things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think if we can find a way to get people to celebrate and do it in a in a responsible way, I'm all for that. And I just wanted to say, I look forward to hearing what they come up with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everybody start working on ideas for your 4th of July mask. I've got the color combination for you. Uh, okay. Anything further from anyone? Okay. Maybe have a roll call vote, please.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'by the planning board. So Councilmember de. So you, I believe, pulled this item, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you. I'll just say quickly, two weeks ago, when we first discussed this item, I indicated that I'd have to mull over it even more. And having done so, I want to first say from the outset, I appreciate the modifications that the city attorney's office had done with regard to partial housing units that are accessory dwelling'",
        "'speaker_2': 'units. Making that effort in light of how that aligns with or not. Chapter 26 of our City Charter, known as Measure A of 1973 or Measure A of 1990. So I appreciate that change, but I still have a larger concern having thought about it over the past two weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I still have a larger concern because I do believe the city of Alameda as a charter city, which means that it can create its own rules. As a charter city, I think there are still some issues that that that we can put forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as we have done so with Measure a, um, I, I get staff's reasoning that the state law in many respects supersedes local law, but I'm not altogether convinced that that's the case in the charter city situations. But I recognize that, you know, staff, counsel and perhaps the public might think otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But for that reason I've decided that I will vote no on five f.'",

    "Update and Direction on COVID-19 Small Business Relief Grant Program. (Community Development)": [
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So then, um. With that. Miss Potter. You. The floor is yours. Okay. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. I am going to behalf of Lois Butler and her economic development team. I'm going to present this item which came to us by way of a request from council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two weeks ago, the city council approved a $600,000 small business grant program for those businesses who have been impacted by the COVID pandemic. Council authorized us to launch that program and asked that we come back with an update to report out on progress for the program to date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then it's an opportunity for staff to take any direction from council. Council did approve this item on April 21st and then on the following Monday we launched the program and to date and the program will be open for ten days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it closes this upcoming Thursday. Today we have received 198 applications, held a webinar last Wednesday. I think there were approximately 78 participants on the webinar that was held last Wednesday, and we have a second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Webinar scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tomorrow and staff has been compiling questions that have been submitted to staff and has posted answers. And I think Lois mentioned that it was maybe 11 pages of Q&A that she was working on today. And then I have a few statistics that I'm going to share with you in terms of who's been applying and where those businesses'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are located in the city. So the largest category of businesses, business types who have submitted applications are service service related businesses, and we have 58 applications from service businesses. And the data I'm giving you now is reflecting 186 applications instead of 196, because that's when the analysis was done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the second largest category are for restaurants with fewer than 25 employees. And we've had 49 applications from restaurants with fewer than 25 employees. We've had 17 applications from retailers. We've had health care. The health care industry has 22 businesses from the health care industry have submitted applications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have another category with 18. And then I know there's been particular interest in childcare and we've had six applications from childcare companies. So those are the where we've have the largest. And you can see that, you know, over 100 have been from the services and restaurants have fewer than 25 employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then another interesting statistic I think is where are the businesses located who have been applying for the program? And by far the largest is from the Park Street Business Improvement area where we've had 74 of the businesses who have applied are located on the Park Street Business Improvement area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then after that, we've had from the West Alameda Business Improvement Area, we've had 20 applications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, wow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the let's see for the. East of Grand 12, located in or near one of the stations 17, and then west of Grand 19. So those and then we've had ten applications from Alameda point and ten from Alameda landing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those are kind of a couple of categories of highlights in terms of types of businesses and business locations. So that that is our our check in status report for the Council. And with that, I'm happy to answer any other questions if I'm able to take any direction from council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Potter. And I believe today on the the business round roundtable, our town hall rather that Miss Potter and not Miss Butler and Miss Durkee and Mr. Fronstin presented think they told us that the let's see is it May the 21st when the announcements will be made.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is correct. And then can you. And by the way, is the is this number we're seeing on the screen? Would that be Miss Butler? No, it's Butler. Thank you. Hello. Hi. Hi. What can you tell us about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is my brother, who's the head of economic development in the city. So I would like to say a couple of things. We did have our second webinar today and and the first one we had over 100 attendee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this one we, we, we didn't quite have that many, but we will be accepting applications through the end of the day on the seventh and then on the 21st, we will be announcing who won the the grant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do you want to explain this further how? Because assuming these are all qualified applications that you receive and there are more applications and funds available than 70 $500 grants available, so how will the decision be made? So what we will be doing is checking the business licenses and the I a business improvement assessment to make sure'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that people have paid last year amount and if they haven't been they will be entered into the lottery and and then we will go down the line. And once once the lotteries are lined up, we will review the application to to make sure that they have reached that that 20% threshold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if they reach that 20% threshold of of a loss of income of that amount, then they would qualify for the grant. Thank you. Um, so, counselor, any questions? Questions. Comments. Be sure you put your hand up. I will just make one comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I noticed in the staff report on page two in the discussion. It's the paragraph that starts in addition to approving the grant program, Council also directed staff to create a special public private partnership, soliciting donations from local residents, private entities and foundations to supplement this small business relief grant program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that staff will present its recommendations to the Council at our next council meeting on May 19th. I just want to clarify that indeed, supporting assisting small businesses is one of the things I believe the council is asking staff to look into creating this fund to cover, but it's not exclusively to assist small businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also talked about renters and about other correct organizations. Right. Okay. Thanks, Ben. But in this in this this particular staff report pertained to assisting small businesses. All right. Thank you. And I know I saw some hands up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela, did I say, okay, I give Councilmember o.T.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't have to go first?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, Councilmember is still muted, so why don't you go ahead. Okay, look at that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any questions? Thanks, Debbie and Lois for this. So I looked at the BIA. There were like 470 members of his bar down to our dollar. Do we know the number in Waba just so we can kind of compare the ratio or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we don't know that that's fine. 20 to 20 apply. Right. But out of how many.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So out of how many members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. 74 out of four. 70.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then are you also asking how many would be qualifying members like that meet the criteria, not just members. Cause.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, I mean, I don't know if we know that yet. I was just trying to see if the ratio was the same. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, the ratio is not the same. And I know that Eric will be on later and he may have that information. Let me I found I just found a list. I just need to go to the bottom of the list to let you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, if it's not really available, it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': '212 is what I have on the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'List. Okay. Yeah. So the ratio is a lot a lot lower on the west side. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, if I could just interject, I know that the Webster BIA includes, for instance, Target, and I think the Safeway and some of the Alameda Landing businesses that probably wouldn't apply. But I just don't know with enough detail to make it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we did have there are ten applications from Alameda landing. There are a lot of small business, small restaurants at Alameda Landing. I guess that it's probably the restaurant tour. So you could add another ten and be part of the labor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's true, because Alameda Landing is part of Bravo. Yeah. Good point. Sorry. Go on, Mr. Trudy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That's a little bit. That helps out a little bit. I know there was some concern about that. And then I guess I would ask our our city manager if we wanted to provide additional funding to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, what type of options do we have? Do we have direct contribution to a possible loan that we could pay back if we raised money? I mean, what options do we have? Because just assuming and I know this is not going to happen, but everyone that applied was eligible, that's 1.485.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm sure we'll get more people with a couple of more days of webinars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Levitt, do you want to answer that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To make a test so I can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understand a little bit better when you're saying so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What? Can you repeat the question again, just so I can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Understand a little bit better a problem, I mean. We all thought this was going to be oversubscribed and it was like way oversubscribed to the tune of 1.485. If everyone who applied is awarded, that won't happen but also be more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What possible ideas would you have to increase the funding to this? Because I think we allocated 600,000 plus another 200 from from Alameda Point. Right. Well, I think one no ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Miss Butler, did you want to respond? Yes, we allocated and there was a listing for the number. It's 502, but 500, $2,500. And then from Alameda point, it's $97,500.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Mm. So. So in answer to the question, I'd say the three approaches for that you could look at would be one is one that you're already looking at on May 19th, and that is how can you get some support through a foundation or some type of of contributions that could then leverage these funds?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually, the second way is that we could re look at some of our current expenditures that were that are budgeted. And we can reduce those. We can look at areas. I'd have to look at it and then reduce those and reallocate the money for something like this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know what those are right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Off the top, but that would be a second. And then a third.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would be potentially it would be the reserves you could spend out of the reserves. And those are the three major ways I could see doing a grant program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A loan programs, a good one if you do a revolving loan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The issue is there is a time set up issue with it. And then you would have to expect that some of these businesses may go go under. And then the final option is that there might be some ways also to expand the current 600,000 or 500,000 that it's already allocated from the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that would be to see put something on in a way that if businesses wanted to take less than the 7500, you might be able to expand it to more businesses. My loan idea was more like we would loan this program money and then just say hypothetically to the idea of matching or profit took off and then'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we were able to repay that if that took up. I mean, that was kind of the idea around the loan not actually loaning to businesses. I mean, I'd be interested in seeing if we could. Oh, I see. You're you're saying loan it to the not for profit with a possible payback?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could look at that. I understand what you're saying. Better or loan it to this particular fund. And then when the nonprofit if there's a nonprofit that moves forward and we raise money, then that can be paid back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That way, the general fund wouldn't be out the entire amount. It just it just the thought. And we kind of like we kind of look at that strategy now. I understand. Better. Okay. That's okay. And then, I mean, since restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What did you say? 49 of them. I just want to make sure that we're and this is probably just going to be touch terms generally. I mean, all of our residents could apply for these great plates delivered that that state project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's going to be people being fed with that. It'd be great if we could find a way that our our city restaurants can benefit because that's no. Well, maybe staff time but there's no. General fund money for grants around that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. I just like to find a way that we can put more money in this. I know. Times are tough, but I mean, this is critical in my mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. I did. Okay. And I actually wanted to ask a question of Miss Butler and Miss Potter. Are we looking at applicants to see what other form of assistance they have applied for? So, you know, are they just relying on the city, the potential of a city grant?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have they gone out for a, you know, SBA Eidl loan? I think it is economic injury, disaster loan or the payment protection program or for sole proprietors or well, sole proprietors. That's a little bit of a sensitive topic because they actually don't qualify under this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then also, when I was walking with my husband up to Park Street and downtown for dinner to get to get dinner on Friday night. And we were walking down Park Street and we were just looking. It's like some restaurants have stayed open to do takeout and delivery, but others have not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so would you take that into consideration? I mean, that I would call it maybe a form of self-help, but I hasten to say that I don't really understand how that decision is made. I mean, is it is it because if you just lay your employees off, they can collect unemployment insurance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think I don't know. It just seems like some consideration should be given to these businesses that are trying to keep employees on staff and and, you know, trying to, you know, help serve the community even during these these difficult times.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I would just be interested to know how you might factor those those items into the grant program. So this is last butler and we we are asking the applicants to file to apply for loans and grants and other things and to show that information as part of their application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we are not factoring in whether or not they are open. Restaurants are open now or or or not because there are a lot of considerations for restaurants to open or not open that we didn't get into with the application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are asking them, however, if they will. We're asking them to certify under penalty of perjury if they're planning to open after this is over. And we are asking them if they if they are not going to be open for six months afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they project that they will have to close within.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Months as well. And that is a factor. And how would you enforce an agreement under penalty of perjury like that? You could sit and you could put you could put a label on their assets if we wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, I, I don't know if you've had an opportunity to run that by the city attorney's office, but no, I haven't. Okay, well, why don't we not let's not go further down that road right now. Okay. Thank you, Miss Butler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, um, the, um. Let's see, Mr. Attorney, did you finish your remarks? You did. Okay. And whose hand did I see it? I see someone else's hand up for comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we do have speakers. Uh, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, and we have speakers. Okay. Um, so I guess I would say any clarifying questions about the report? Then let's hear from our speakers and then we'll come back, Councilmember Vella, and just unmute yourself there. Yeah. I think you do stuff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I wanted to I did have a couple of questions. One was, I guess, and part of it was answered previously, but how are we going to or can we way somebody who is already considering closure or bankruptcy or something like that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there other factors we could look at in terms of making sure that the money goes towards actually keeping the business afloat? So are we are we asking questions like, how long have you been open or are we looking into things like that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or how many are we asking questions about how many other businesses they may own in Alameda or if they're they own a number of different franchises or locations? Are those questions that we're looking at. Okay. Okay. This is Lois Fowler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're not asking the questions of do they own other, other businesses? But we are asking them in a way, if they'd been open more than a year or not, because we can see that with what they submit. The problem is based on their financial, well, six months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if they're a new business then under our program because we're asking for financials before and after, they might not be eligible. They will be eligible, but we will know that information, is what I'm saying. Okay. But how will we be able to calculate the 20% loss?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're using February. That was part of the program. So it would just be prior the month prior. Correct. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Any other clarifying questions before we hear from the public? Okay. Um, uh, madam close. Let's go to our public comments, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have one public comment that was submitted by email and one that was submitted via text. And the first one is from Ron Mooney. And he says, I am appreciative of the quick work that staff did to create the business grant program quickly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are some issues which have been raised on the policy and implementation of the program, especially in light of the desire to fundraise for additional funding and grants while not allowing publicly traded companies is a good step at limiting allowing large businesses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Looking at the makeup of small businesses needs to be through a different lens than the current program. Allowing sole proprietors to apply should be a given. Looking at more than March 2019 versus 2020, revenues needs to be required.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A ranking system should be developed so businesses with a severe hit and an end and unlikely to be able to reopen without the funds rank higher than businesses with some loss and enough assets to survive a few more months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Plenty of discussion should be had to gain input and develop a program which could be as simple as possible. But safeguards to ensure the neediest are serve. Complicated and a hard task. Ready to help brainstorm as I know others are as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then the text. If there are limited funds for the grant program before allocating those funds, please consider raising the last level from 20% to something higher. So we hit more of the businesses that are most at risk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Most businesses can survive a 20% hit. It is those with the 50 or higher percent that are truly at risk. And that's the final public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. So will there be some sort of ranking system? Um. Staff. Currently we have a lottery that we plan to use. The lottery system that I described earlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just this is Lois Butler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know. I recognize your voice so well. I was interested in the in the suggestion. Through the text that you look at. Um, you know, which businesses would be impacted most? Maybe that had the deeper losses. But, um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyway, tell us, Ms.. Potter. So we Lois is right when she talks about the fact that we're doing the lottery. But to become eligible for the lottery, you have to have met the minimum criteria that were adopted by the council, and that does include a minimum loss of income, the 20% that you have applied.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to clarify that either if you have employees. So if you have one or more employees and you are a sole proprietor, you are eligible for this funding. So minimum eligibility criteria were established. And I suppose that the Council and then the idea of what we were balancing, as Mr. Mooney pointed out, how to'",
        "'speaker_0': ', how to make sure we are reaching those most in need. At the same time, acting with expediency was something that we heard clearly from the council that we wanted to be able to move quickly so that this is our attempt to balance to set minimum eligibility criteria and then do the lottery.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yes, the council did want to give direction to to be more nuanced about the eligibility criteria. You know, more than a 20% loss would get preference. The council could give us direction. But note that the criteria was already approved two weeks ago, and that's the way we've been marketing and running the program so far.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to hear from my colleagues about this. And I, I do understand and I I'm mindful of the fact that the criteria was put forth. The Council did so. And as with many things, we know more as time goes by.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The reason I think we should give some consideration to maybe adding some nuances is that it might mean the difference between some businesses surviving this shelter in place and closure or reduced business and not. And um, the reason that we, as I understood it, that we required people to have at least one employee is that we were'",
        "'speaker_0': 'trying to help more people. Um, it's, it's tough. I mean, there's, there's no easy way to say yes to some and no to others. But I, I am concerned about the survival of businesses, and I wonder if there's more we can do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's one woman's thought. Let's hear from others. Raise your hand, Vice Mayor. Let's hear from you. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. So I would be really uncomfortable changing the criteria now after we voted on it two weeks ago. This closes tomorrow. You had a lot of people put time and effort into this based on what they assumed that was was the way in which we were moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I there's no there's never as you as you acknowledged, Mayor Ashcroft, never a perfect way to move forward. And we're moving forward fast. And I'm sure we could build a better mousetrap with more time, but I'm worried that we would actually we're not going to be able to decide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not confident that giving somebody who's lost 50% of their of their business, 70 $500 is going to be the thing that saves their business any more than I'm going to. That that 70 $500 for somebody who lost 20% is going to be the the make or break.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I would be very nervous about going backwards on that from my standpoint. I really did like two things that Councilmember O.D. kind of I'm going to say mentioned in his questions, ask questions about they sounded like things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I think that where we can find working with the state program on restaurants a way to move forward with that where we can get money that we provide to restaurants that also brings a community benefit I think is a positive thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to see if there. I appreciated the city manager's listing. My understanding of why we asked this to come back was that if we were oversubscribed, we could then look at are there other money sources that we could add to this so that we could increase the pot?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that by any definition we are way oversubscribed on this, and I would be at least be interested. I heard the city manager list off three different ideas on how we might increase funding, where the funding might come back in in a couple of weeks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there was an item that came back that brought another two or $300,000 for us to consider, and we knew what that tradeoff was, I would be very open to having that conversation. Also, the staff report does talk about us leveraging small business and public private partnerships.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that we talked about the item that is going to be on the referral at the end of the meeting. But we also talked about the idea of going out and acting very quickly to work with our business community, who was looking to set up a go fund me or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And having spoken to some of those businesses, leaders of Waba, etc., I believe. They are ready to ask our community to donate now. And my biggest concern is that if we are waiting to set up a community fund that won't even start getting money put into it until June or July.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's very necessary and we should do it and I'm very excited about that, the concept and I won't go too far there, but I also think we need to be acting now. And I think that if we could set up, we have restaurants in town that have gotten ten and $20,000, go fund me injections over'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the course of a week. And I think if our community were to come together for a Save Alameda Businesses campaign, the idea that we could help through private sources raised to 10 to 20% more than what we have already done and use the list of businesses that are already applied for this year that we've got 80 businesses'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city could provide businesses 81 through 90 and fund nine more nine more businesses on the same day. If money is available from a go fund me and they can provide those to Wahba and or or the organizers of the go fund me to distribute that money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it would be very quick and we'd be able to help people before we're asking them to reopen to give them that seed money that might actually help them to be supportive. And so I would hope that I feel that was a part of our ask two weeks ago, but I would hope that we could if if'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we needed additional direction tonight to have additional direction to jump on that tomorrow with the folks who are ready to go. There was a concern that was raised about the lack of multiple language outreach for this grant. And I'm just wondering if we're going to be bringing back additional money.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm wondering if we could also come back with maybe some way to do some just to open up a grant program for for folks in the city's kind of three highest language categories to talk about this again with rent, rent assistance and whatnot and the need to meet people where they're at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I feel in our speed at somewhere that we may have just accidentally not not addressed. But I think that it's something that if we're looking to kind of grow this support and whatever else, that outreach would be very useful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we might be able to find some businesses that that could use the help as well. And I'd like to I'd like to ask staff too to look at that. Lastly, a very small thing, but I did receive some information that apparently the grant application program doesn't work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're submitting via the Microsoft Edge browser, it only works with Chrome and some businesses were having an issue with that and luckily staff were able to tell them. But I'm wondering if we could add that since tomorrow is the deadline and people are going to be very panicked, adding the language on that website that says Please'",
        "'speaker_3': 'do not use Microsoft Edge would go a long way to lowering anxiety and phone calls to staff, but I want to thank that. Ms.. Butler, Ms.. Potter, the rest of the staff who have worked on this, you know, the lift that has been done and I think the quality of the work that has been done here and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the response is really, really tremendous. And thank you. And I just want to find a way to build on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Vice Mayor, just for clarification, Mr. Porter and Ms.. Butler, I was under the impression that the deadline was May the seventh and maybe even midnight, May the seventh. Is that correct? Which is actually Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the report says May six.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, the executive summary didn't get fixed for the body. Yeah. I was on the town hall today and I heard that a couple.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Today says and then I'm council vice mayor just explain to me I missed a little bit of how how are you proposing that the city work with a go fund me campaign. Are you saying the city should put money into lobbyists go fund me campaign.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What is it saying that I think that not of us go fund me. I believe there's an Alameda business go fund me campaign that is interested in starting and if the city were to promote it and then has a list of 190 possible businesses and we know only 80 of them are going to get it, we would'",
        "'speaker_3': 'just go down the list in the next ten or 12 or 15 or whatever our community can fund would then be eligible for the money from the go fund me and they would just get it straight from from the business district as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again, it would be very little staff time other than our fantastic public information officer, but the actual work and fundraising would be done from the private sector.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Councilmember Vela has her hand at Councilmember Vela. Hi. So I had I have similar concerns about changing the criteria at this far in. But I think that if we are going to have a second tier or a second round, I'm comfortable changing the criteria there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think perhaps prioritizing businesses that have taken a harder hit at that point, I think would be appropriate and perhaps and we do a lottery for that round. It's businesses that have experienced a more significant loss that get that that are just the pool of candidates that we're that we're drawing the lottery from at that point'",
        "'speaker_0': 'would be would be my preference. I also think that a lot of this is cash flow issues right now for for businesses. And I think that's where the exigency comes from. But I like the idea of looking at if there's a possibility of the city perhaps fronting some money or loaning some money to the program that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'potentially could get back. I think that it's in my at least in my view, I think that the city needs to pursue this public private fund with potentially with looking at different grants and nonprofits and donors. But I also know that if, you know, I don't have a problem with a parallel track that would include on the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go Fund Me campaign that the business community has talked about. I think that that would be appropriate. And certainly if there's some way I would want to hear from the city attorney's office and obviously have staff consult with the city attorney's office about the legality of that, if, you know, in terms of who collects the money and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'how it would be administered if we're the ones promoting it. But I'd be fine promoting it on social media, promoting it on our websites and obviously with the individual councilmembers, I think. But I, I just want to caution against and I, I think part of the reason that I like the idea of a citywide go fund me'",
        "'speaker_0': 'is that there have been a lot of these individuals go fund me campaigns and I'm it just I just I appreciate that people have been been innovative in terms of how they've they've made it through. But I also want to make sure that we're spreading these contributions around and getting to businesses that might not have the same'",
        "'speaker_0': 'social media following or presence that some of these other ones did, but are still important to our community and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Employers. Um, the the I know it was controversial about the. The sole proprietors. But there were also some businesses that had like 26 employees or 30 employees at two different sites who were also not included or who aren't necessarily eligible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would also just ask that if we're going to look at some of the nuances for the next round, that we also consider looking at businesses that maybe have a couple locations. But but, you know, 30 employees in Alameda as opposed to 25 but at two different sites because there are some for instance, again, and I'",
        "'speaker_0': 'think kind of harp this harp on this point that there are some daycare providers and preschool operators that have multiple locations and therefore have a staff that's a little bit bigger. Sorry, it's bedtime with. I popped out to do bathtime and now he's getting ready for bed, but I know he looks like he's winding up to me'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Well, there's lots of like with that. This is. It's a pretty bad burst of energy. Sorry. There are some some businesses that, like I said, have a couple locations here in Alameda. We want them to continue to be operational.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would also ask that we perhaps look at some of the businesses that might be necessary in terms of the governors pier, that reopening to make sure that we're keeping those businesses operational. And I really do have concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that daycare and preschool are very important to that. And if these businesses are struggling, I would like to see us make sure that they're somehow included. And in terms of eligibility and one of the concerns that I heard that they might have 30 employees because they have two locations citywide, so they're therefore not eligible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all. Thank you. Okay, thanks. Let's see. We've heard from maybe heard from Councilmember de SAC. Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, great. Well, thank you. Um, you know, make no mistake, the, uh, $600,000 or so that we're investing that the City Council is investing in this, um, COVID 19 Small Business Emergency Relief Fund represents a substantial amount of taxpayer dollars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And at the end of the day, after some entities have been funded through this program, some entities might not survive so that there is a, there is risk involved in this. Um, but it's my opinion though, that it's a risk that is worth taking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, we all know the, um, the health related issues that all of us are possibly confronted with. But, um, when it comes to the, our local economy, whether it's Park Street or Webster Street, um, this is a, this is no ordinary times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that was a that was the title of a book by, uh, renowned historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. No Ordinary Times. And I think it's in times like this that we need to step up and do those unusual things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, this is literally fourth down and we're way deep and and the football field and we've got, you know, 70 yards to go. Um, and I do think that as a city council, as a fiduciary of taxpayer money, um, we, as a council, I do believe are making a reasonable and prudent decision in moving forward in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this, and that's why I supported it last time and I will continue to support it. Um, but let's make our eyes, our decisions with eyes wide open and that there will be some failures. There will be some businesses who we fund, who will, who will not survive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, um, but I think it's a risk worth taking and we're not all swinging wildly. I think we're moving ahead in a prudent, rational and sober manner. And I appreciate the work that staff has done in getting us here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, as for other ideas accessing, create, accessing, joining or creating different programs such as a Go Fund Me that has been mentioned. The only thing I would say to that is just to make sure that the city attorney's office makes sure to protect us from any kind of outstanding legal issues that might arise from that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I have no doubt, obviously, the city attorney's office would do that. But if we're going to join others as a junior partner or, or or as a leader in other programs, um, you know, we just need to protect ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But when it comes to this program, um, I support it and I think, um, we wish we had more than $600,000 now. Um, but given the amount of responses that we've gotten, I think it's a good indication that, you know, Park Street, Web Street and all other business communities are really struggling, and we're trying to do our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'level best in this time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm really glad I decided to wait because there were some really good comments and suggestions from my colleagues and, you know, just to kind of give them a little credit. And the mayor, I mean, this is all new to us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I appreciate, you know, that we've we've been able to step up and support our staff. And I'm glad we're doing it. I'm not happy we have to do this, but I'm glad we're doing this. And I'd like to see us probably give more money if we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like the idea of, you know, the go fund me. You know, we if we are able to fund another 20 grants and then maybe the Go fund me funds another ten, that's what, $75,000? I think our community should be able to raise that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've discussed with my colleagues, if we promote it and somebody gives more than 5000, we have a bit payment issue. So maybe the city attorney can remind us of those rules. We have to report. I just second all the ideas that that came in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I appreciate Mr. Mooney's suggestions. I agree with my colleagues that maybe it's a little too late to change them for this round. But if we are going to pump more money in this, I'd be open to having a different criteria for the next next round.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, I. I think. Maria, I'm sorry Governor Vela said it best or maybe it was the mayor. I mean, this is a cash flow issue. So the sooner that we can get money to the hands of these businesses, the better.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I do think we should do something for sole proprietors if we can, even if they're just one woman, one woman shops.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Thank you, counselor. Brody, did you? Okay, thanks. And I want to ask the city manager, Eric Levitt, to just touch briefly on this great pledge delivery program that we've heard referenced here. Mr. Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I could. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Okay. Is that Tony? Oh, I don't know. Oh, mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, okay. So if I could, I'll try to address a great place briefly and maybe even go fund me my perspective on it. So on the great the great plate, great plates, I think the area that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Been hit on by several councilmembers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tonight is definitely the primary benefit of benefit of it. And that is it's another way of helping the restaurants and the local restaurants. And I think I understand that. I think Debbie understands that. I think we we supported that, that the the the concerns that we're struggling against.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're going to look at it further.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the things we're going to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Struggle against is that we have several programs to do. Then there's the other side and there's the people that are benefiting from it because it's all it's about getting food to those that need food is is the is the end user.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I could just interject, because I was on the conference call last week, there's this is for seniors and actually middle income seniors, not the low and the very low income because they're already covered by programs like Cal Fresh and some others.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's a concern that the governor has that these seniors oftentimes who live alone, who don't have a support network, aren't getting out to get their groceries and proper nutrition, are needing meals. And I think also the the desire to help our restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, Eric, go on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, no, I agree. And so we haven't seen as many, many of those individuals that need food in a different way. There's three or four programs through the community, including a couple through the city that already do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm not sure how much this will be utilized. And the biggest concern we have, we're going to evaluate, but the biggest concern we have is our staff resources are really getting stretched thin. And we may go in so many directions that we don't get anything accomplished for some of these programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's that's that's the concern we're trying to address right now. But we can look at that and see what we can do because and see what the requirements as far as their they require a plan and certain things when you apply as a city to do that program, I just want to make sure everyone's aware of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that. And then on the go fund me, I think that or some other similar way are good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My only concern on the go fund.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Me is that tends to be not have a lot of regulation around go fund me. I just want to make sure that people that donate to the cause have have a fairly good security that is going to go to the cause, especially if the city is promoting whatever way we do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a couple, there's foundations. You can actually do a municipal trust. You can do a variety of areas where they can definitely account for their money. The Go Fund Me. I just want to make sure that we do it in a way that the city puts it in the way it's intended and that the and the people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'donating what it goes, where the people donating are intending for the money to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Levitt. And, um, let's see. So, um, I've heard a lot of good direction, Counsel. I see the, um. The Vice mayor has his hand out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I just want to say I appreciated that update from from the city manager on the Great Plains program. I understanding that staff has a lot say a lot on their plate, but that would be terrible. But like a lot going in there, things have changed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My memory is that the city of Alameda Meals on Wheels program is the largest Meals on Wheels program in the entire country. This, despite our city size and I have received, if not biweekly, at least weekly email saying that with the with the COVID crisis, there is a huge need for people to help them make sure that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'they can meet the needs of our community. And so it might there might be a partnership there. I just want to throw out, you know, I'm ready to make a motion if your comments were done. Madam Chair, I didn't want to jump in in front of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I think, if I recall correctly, we're just receiving this update and giving direction. And I think we've given direction unless the the city attorney wants us to proceed in some other fashion. I do see Councilman Vela, your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's just hear from the city. Attorney is just receiving staff receiving our direction sufficient. That was a yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Unless the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wants to make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Additional direction to staff. You can, but you are not required to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go additional direction beyond what we've all made in our comments this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Yes. Yes. And if the council wants to take a vote on any of them, you could. You don't have to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess I would ask the city manager if he feels that the direction he's heard among the many things includes investigating and reporting back at the next meeting on the steps taken for the great plates coming back in two weeks with some sort of additional funding that we can consider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would suggest $300,000 and supporting the public private partnership with obviously the city attorney's input and Mr. Levitt's agreement that it's a safe thing to do. I don't need to make a motion, but that would have been my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess I would just as soon leave it to the city manager who is keeping a pretty close eye on our finances to come back with the amount. I'm intrigued by all three possibilities he laid out. Councilmember Velez had her hand up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just I know that Meals on Wheels this is has increased their care delivery, obviously, and the demand has gone up and so has it. So has the senior meal program, I believe, on the senior center. And that councilmember and Odie and I have been to a couple of the days but that, you know, one of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'things that they haven't found the replacement for is the the human to human interaction in contact. And so if we do the program, it would be nice if we could have it being run through or coordinate with one of our existing partnerships and programs, whether it's Meals on Wheels or through math there or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just because I don't want to see a lot of duplication of agencies and staff, and I think it's the expense that the city manager's point about staffing kind of stretch them over. It's I just want to be mindful of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I can actually add a little insight because I was on a conference call last week for mayors and city managers about the great plates program from the state. And the way it works is actually that the city administers it in so far as it signs up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The participating restaurants and the restaurants have criteria that they have to meet from the Department of Agriculture about nutrition standards of the the meals they provide, and then it is the restaurants that provide the delivery. In fact, that's part of what they're paid for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're paid it's on a sliding scale, depending on what they're providing, could be up to three meals a day. But they provide the delivery people who must be background checks because they are delivering to our most some of our most vulnerable residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the city isn't involved in delivery, but it would be involved in making sure that we can reach out to those seniors who qualify. And again, it's income related, but not our lowest income seniors. So, you know, it does take a bit of footwork, but as far as the meal preparation, the delivery that is that is up'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to the restaurants. That's that's the way this program is set up. I guess my question was and I know for spectrum, which does the meal program, they make the meals that are distributed out of mastic. There are a lot of people that are contacting these organizations asking for help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Meals on Wheels or Mastic might not necessarily be able to serve those individuals because of their income or because of different things. And so I'm just wondering if there is a way for us to work with that less that's already perhaps at those organizations rather than doing a whole.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm going to call on Ms.. Potter. I know from Meals on Wheels there actually is no income limits or requirements. I believe you're asked to pay on a sliding scale. I'm less familiar with some of the other programs, but as far as a resource, that's a possibility for getting names in this part.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think I saw your hand up. Yep. Thank you. I was just going to say that both Meals on Wheels and the program at Mastic, neither of those are income, income restricted or income tested. So if you're a senior citizen or if for Meals on Wheels, if you're homebound, I mean that to be a senior, you can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'get meals delivered and that to you it's not income tested. I would just like to point out, too, that there is I believe it's a 6.2% administrative fee that the city has to pay as part of the great place program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So one of the things that I think we should look at is would that money be better off if we augmented or grew that the grant program or if we did the grade plates? And my last suggestion would be, rather than coming back to council with an agenda item in two weeks, if we could provide an update'",
        "'speaker_0': 'on the Great Place program a different way that I think would be helpful for staff. That sounds fine to me. I just want to note, because I was on the call and actually I have to apologize for city staff that I emailed my notes to because man, I take a strange form of shorthand when I'm typing fast'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and everybody was talking fast on this call. Even the administrative portion of the program that falls to the city, we were told, is reimbursable through HUD. And so if the city decides that it has the wherewithal to go forward, I was going to reach out to our Congresswoman Barbara Lee's office to just connect this with the right'",
        "'speaker_0': 'folks at head to make sure that. But, you know, like much of emergency response, you put the money out and then are reimbursed. But but again. They made that point on the call and you could be forgiven for not having found it in my notes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor I had one last point. So the city manager and I talked about this, and it was something we talked about two weeks ago, and he mentioned it as something he could do. So I wanted to just get the temperature on it because I'm not sure if it's moving forward or not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as we give the people there notice that they have been successful, I do think it would be really good for us to give people the option to receive less money. Just say, hey, there are I think we could say there are 190 people who applied.'",
        "'speaker_3': '80 people are getting it. If you take a little less, that will help another business in our community. And I well, I don't think a lot of people are going to do that. I do think that there would be enough that we might help two or three or five more businesses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'd just like to, you know, make that an offer that they can give back through this process rather than requiring them to take the full thing. And I don't think it would add that much to the, hey, congratulations letter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't think that's changing the criteria too much, that that's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not can change the criteria at all?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anything more before we wrap up our direction to staff?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Mr. Desai.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to say earlier we were talking about looking at loans, and I certainly want to second that discussion. I would love to have a staff take a look at that. Looking at the existing instruments that we as a city control and seeing how we can possibly loan that out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For example, many years ago I remember talking about CDBG and then loaning out CDBG as an economic development tool called I think it's called the HUD float. This was back in the mid 1990s and doing a quick Google search.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It looks like that is still allowable, but insofar as CDBG is often income tied, perhaps if we are going to take a look at borrowing against next year's CDBG in an effort to then loan it out through the some kind of HUD loan program, we might also get in touch with HUD in terms of seeking waivers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Waivers when it comes to the if there are any income restrictions when it comes to loaning out CDBG funds. So that's something that we might want to take a look at. So you're not going to affect current CDBG program participants, but is it possible to to to loan against the future CDBG and then reload that out anyways'",
        "'speaker_2': '? So that's certainly why I think we should take a look at the various loans that we could potentially create.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's another item for consideration. Mr. O.D..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Just one more thing. I mean, since the vice mayor brought it up, I mean, I like the idea of giving people the opportunity to accept less if they wanted to. I mean, who knows how many would do it, but you never know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Doesn't hurt to ask, right? That's what I mean. I think we have to change as we know more information we have to make. You know, we would we would be wise to take that into consideration. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great discussion, everyone. Thank you so much. I think we are ready to put you in this special meeting and move on to the other one. Thank you, Ms.. Potter and Ms.. Butler, for all your work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you both.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For adhering back more from you. All right. So with that, we are adjourning this special meeting and we are resuming. Our Council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we were on six a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. I just am at the mercy of my iPad. It wants to let me see my agenda. That's okay. I've got a paper agenda. Come on. Okay. So, item six, a madam quick would you introduce said eight, impressed with a.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, we can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. That's much better. Okay. Andrew Thomas, planning building and transportation director. As the city clerk said, this is there's two items we're covering. Two items in this agenda piece with. This is one is the introduction of an ordinance amending our parking regulations within the Almeida Municipal Code and really to try to modernize those those provisions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will just briefly summarize some of those amendments for you tonight. And then the second piece is adoption of a policy for the use of automated license plate recognition readers for the purposes of parking management and enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'll talk a little bit about that piece as well. The two, though, are we're bringing them together in this one staff report because they're both, we believe, instrumental to improving and modernizing our ability as a city to manage public parking here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're both of these actions, we believe, are consistent with your general plan policies that talk about the need to manage parking as a as a tool in managing our transportation network. And there is no bigger issue in Alameda, or at least there hasn't been historically than transportation in our ability to manage traffic and transportation and parking is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a piece of that. And the general plan recognizes that the 2014 Alameda Point Transportation Demand Management Plan adopted by the City Council, the 2018 Transportation Choices Plan and your 2019 Climate Action Plan all talk about how important it is that we effectively manage parking, not just to make sure that everyone can get access to public parking when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'they need it at a price that they can afford. But it's also instrumental in our ability to support the business community, reduce congestion around the city, reduce greenhouse gases, and just ensure the health of our business community and our environment, everything from our ability to to do street cleaning, which is a way of keeping San Francisco Bay'",
        "'speaker_2': 'clean, to dealing with the larger issues of climate change and the need to reduce greenhouse gases. We're not going to be able to effectively do any of those things that we can't effectively manage our parking supply and the space for parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other goals of these of these two companion pieces, as we to manage parking effectively, we think it also has to be convenient and flexible for the for the public and the users. It has to be flexible so that you the city council, when making policy decisions about how to manage public parking, that you can quickly and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'easily flex your policies and your and your tools to better enforce these two proposals are also really just trying to make our parking program more efficient and more frankly, cost effective. And then lastly, and this is certainly not something we talked about when we originally wrote this staff report two months ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But even with the COVID 19, we are starting to think about parking in a different way and the needs for parking and the needs for people to be able to pick up and drop off food and retail and all sorts of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we don't quite know how that's going to play out, but I think it's pretty clear to us that the need to manage our parking spaces and manage parking and manage the use of the public right of ways is not going to be an issue that's going to go away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And anything we can do to make that system work better, make it more flexible and easier to adjust, is going to serve us well. So two months ago when we wrote this, we are also very much focused on being able to start charging for parking at the ferry terminals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wanted to and we were pushing, pushing hard to get those parking charges in place by August, obviously, with the. But COVID 19 and the health emergency and the complete sort of drop off in ferry ridership, we don't believe this is the time to start charging for parking for the ferry terminals, but we do think it is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the time to start getting set up so that we will be able to do it when life starts to return to normal and ferry ridership returns. So let me just quickly summarize these two different actions. The first is the draft amendments to the parking codes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are really quite straightforward because the parking code is so old, for example, that I'll just hit on the four main changes to the Muni code that we're recommending. The first is about forms of payment. The currently the Alameda Mosby code does not include provisions allowing for modern forms of payment, such as mobile payment or digital permits'",
        "'speaker_2': '. That is that is going to be something we want to be able to implement in the future. And it's important that our municipal code allows it. This will allow these amounts, allow for flexibility and convenience of paying with cell phones, customized parking rates, all those kinds of adjustments and modernization that a modern parking program is going to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'need. The amendments allow for the different being able to charge for parking in different kinds of spaces. Currently, the AMC doesn't include any provisions to allow for pay by play or multi spaced meter. Nancy currently assumes that every space is always going to be numbered or equipped with an individual meter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, when looking into the future, looking at things like large parking areas, neighborhood parking permit areas, we want to be able to manage parking even if every space isn't numbered or individually metered. And there are ways to do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thirdly, rate adjustments. The current municipal code and these provisions which were adopted originally, many years ago, assumed that parking rates just weren't going to change very often. You know, just a parking meter was going to cost essentially the same for four years on end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These adjustments make it easier for adjustments to be made by the council and or the city manager and public works director. As necessary, it may be everything from changing the hourly rates at Park Street and Webster Street to establishing a special rate for a special event at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You want to have that flexibility to adjust rates and do it flexibly and quickly. And then finally, the other main big issue we wanted to address in these code amendments is currently the ordinance talks about any revenue generated from parking revenue must go straight back into parking, maintenance and parking enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That all makes great sense. That's still where most of the money will probably always need to go. But these amendments broaden those potential uses so that if the council felt that you had additional revenue from parking, you could start to, let's say, use it for other transportation programs like funding a shuttle or supplemental bus service to the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ferry terminal to reduce the need for parking and ferry terminals, using parking revenues for projects, transportation demand management kinds of programs, bicycle and pedestrian improvements could also be something that the council might in the future choose to use parking revenues for all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Vision Zero work that you're doing is basically trying to make other transportation modes more effective to reduce the demand on the public parking supply. So those that's a general overview unavailable to answer your questions on the code amendments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, let me just move quickly to the second half of this, which is sort of the other piece of this equation. We also want to put the city in the position to be able to use the most modern tools for parking enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of those tools that we are recommending is license plate recognition technology to expedite and make the process of enforcing these permit programs more effective. We also think it's going to make it more convenient and user friendly for the customer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's going to help support that flexibility we talked about. And as I said earlier, it's just a very cost effective way of. Doing parking enforcement. For those of you who show the council is all very much aware, but for the benefit of the public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'License plate technology essentially replaces the old fashioned manual approach for parking technicians to check to see if somebody has paid for the parking space on the public street or lost it there that they have or that they're using to store their vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In this case, it's a camera mounted on a vehicle that automatically processes the license plate number on a car and that can then can then verify whether that car has paid for the parking. If not, they can immediately in real time send that data to a handheld and the parking technician can write a ticket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there's no more of the checking for green lights on meters. There's no more of make checking for little white slips on parking that vehicle dashboards. No more chalking of tires, none of that. With this new technology, you are able to move much more quickly, much more cost effectively.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know, I've already mentioned this, but we're just following the lead of our other cities here in the Bay Area, San Francisco, Berkeley, San Leandro, Emeryville. Pretty much any city that's really modernizing their parking program is using this technology.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's very cost effective. It's very flexible, and it's great for also understanding use. You know, how many cars are parking every day in certain lots, but there is a there are issues to be considered. And the first and foremost is the privacy issues around this kind of technology.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What this technology does and the privacy issue that we talk about in the staff report is you're collecting huge amounts of data, huge amounts of data at once. And when, in fact, we only need one while we're really looking just for one thing, has that vehicle paid for the parking for the space it's using that day?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, by collecting this amount of data, and if misused or not secure, it can be used by individuals or organizations to track people. It can be misused if it's in the wrong hands and that or is transferred to some other group or organization that wants to use it for a different purpose.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Obviously, from our perspective, we're only interested in the technology for one reason, and that is to help us manage our parking supply. We are not interested in it for tracking people or for any other purpose. So what you have attached to your staff report in the package today are two important documents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One is the policy. And so this would be the city's policy for how this technology will be used and how will be used in a way that they were careful about making sure that that information and that data does not end up being misused by others or by ourselves, and that we try to minimize the potential privacy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'impacts of the use of this data that may occur if we are who are using it for parking management. So essentially the exhibit to the impact analysis essentially acknowledges the risks and identifies mitigations and essentially strategies and requirements that we can impose on ourselves to really minimize those potential risk and safeguard personal privacy and meaningful and minimize'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the potential impacts. I won't summarize both those documents, but I think the three main criteria that you will see is that we take essentially three approaches. Number one, the control of the information, the way we're proposing to proceed here is that like every other city, we would be bringing on a separate vendor to provide this technology and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to store that data for us. This data would be owned by the city of Alameda. So with our information, we are going to be responsible for it and we're not going to share it. Now, of course, you minimize all the you minimize the risks around that whole issue of not sharing if you don't store it for very'",
        "'speaker_2': 'long. So the second important concept here is as that parking technician with their vehicle is driving down the street and recording every single parking, every single license plate and getting hits or no hits, you know, hit is in this terminology, meaning that car did not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hey, for the parking or that car is stolen or is is wanted for some reason there's a violation in that only in those cases the data would be kept for violations or hits for other existing problems with that vehicle, stolen vehicle or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That data then would be stored for a maximum of two years. Every other license plate, all the other data. If you paid your parking ticket, your car is clean. That data is erased that day. We don't need that data for our purposes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We don't want to have to store it. We the the proposal here is just to eliminate that data. So the vast majority of the data that's collected each day around the individual vehicles is going to be deleted. We only keep the people who have not paid for their parking or there's some other violation there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The vehicle is stolen or there's an issue, this active crime situation around that vehicle. So there is a tradeoff. Of course, that means we're not keeping information. That information could be valuable to the police department if they were investigating some sort of crime that occurred after the fact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We felt that on the whole, this was an appropriate trade off. We we recognize there are privacy issues and there is a tradeoff with police trying to balance that with personal privacy. But in this case, we felt like we had about the right balance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it has sort of been, in our view, the balance we struck here is a a policy that recognizes the privacy protections are necessary, allows us to proceed as a city with cost effective parking enforcement and modernize our planning and management of the parking, as well as our climate change and customer convenience and flexibility sort of goals'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So we think we've struck the appropriate balance. We hope you agree. If you do, then the recommendation would be to introduce the first reading of the ordinance amendments tonight and approve the policy for the use of automated license plate readers for the purpose of parking enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you do approve the policy, then our next step would be to start soliciting a vendor who is comfortable with our own restrictions and requirements. And of course, that vendor would come back to council for before we could sign a contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's sort of the initial steps. I'm available to answer any questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Good report. Um, Counsel, do we have any clarifying questions before we go to public comment? I guess I should ask the city clerk, do we have public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So, Counsel, let's just ask any clarifying questions of Mr. Thomas. Now we'll hear public comment and we'll come back for a discussion. Vice Mayor Knox Wait.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it might be for the city manager, but whoever is the appropriate place and I apologize for not asking this earlier, it didn't come up until I was listening to the presentation. I'm curious in in how the decision was made that the public works director is the one who sets our parking policy price.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Given that the transportation this is kind of moving us further into a transportation policy arena, which is where I think park pricing and parking should be. And why that wouldn't be either the city manager or the the transportation director or planning body and transportation director who's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm not sure who I could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eric, unless you want to respond, I can certainly give some background on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, I look, I think for tonight's purposes, it certainly would be fine to make it the city manager instead of the public works director. Our thinking around that specific language, though, was not that we were trying to take the power away from the city manager or the city council, for that matter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was the thought was that council would set policy directions. For example, Perkins Webster Street Youth Council in past years have adopted a policy that the city should maintain the park. The parking meter pricing at a rate that would ensure 85% occupancy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The concept being, if it's all empty, it means the price is too high, if it's all full and its price is too low. So 85% occupancy sort of means you're driving down the street every block. There's one or two spaces available that would be sort of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the thought was, once the council set the policy, then the public works director and the management of the parking meters and the parking lot are really under the purview of the public works department in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it wasn't really trying to set the public works director off as the policy maker as much as the person implementing, you know, changing the actual rates to implement a policy that was adopted by by council. That was the thinking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think changing it from public works director to city manager or his designee also would be a fair. Adjustment if that was something the council wanted to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. Thank you, Mark.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. And Mr. Chen, city attorney. Mr. Chen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. I just want to also add that looking at the ordinance, there is existing language and previous ordinance language that designates the public works director as the person who is essentially managing the various parking endeavors. So if the council wishes to make changes, will want to be really clear in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what places is the Council looking to make changes from public works director to something else, it appears. And maybe a dozen or more places in the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that. And Mr. Leavitt, did you want to add anything? No. I can hear you. I could see you shaking your head. Okay, that's a no. Um. Any other clarifying questions? Mr. Desai?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you. Um, what thought? Well, frankly, I'd love to see Cesar Chavez Day be celebrated March 31st. I think it's a state holiday. Um, it's. It's not included there in section nine, so that I would certainly encourage that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And frankly, I think generally not just in this one, but generally I think the city of Alameda ought to celebrate that day. Um, so we might look forward its future and how we might change the city holidays. So, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was your clarifying question. Thank you. Um, I've got one. If no one else has a clarifying question. Um, Mr. Thomas, I just wanted to ask a question in the I'm in the draft policy, which is exhibit one and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. I have the temperamental iPad today. Okay, I got it. And my question is on page two of the draft policy. It talks about storage of data and parking enforcement. El Paso automated license plate reader data is stored based on the following schedule.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'License plates collected but not cited. So what you were talking about there? Collected. But they pay. There's no problem with that car. That data is not retained. But the second bullet is license plates for issued parking citations retained for two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now I don't see our police chief popolare here, but if I recall correctly, the policy that governs our LPR data for the patrol vehicle mounted pass the one year retention policy. And assuming I'm correct in that, why would we make this data storage period longer?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I see city attorney been shown with his hand at that. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Shen And so we actually inquired with the police chief and the fact that the policy here in front of you actually stores data for less time and all the cards. So what Mr. Thomas is proposing is 24 hours of storage of no heads and two years experience ahead with the police department's policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's more I believe it's in the more in the range of six months of storage when there's no heads and and potentially unlimited length of storage when there isn't. So the policy in front of you tonight stores far less data than the existing APD policy that's in existence, that the inquiry that we made earlier today with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'police department in anticipation of this question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my question would be, cause I was on the council that set that policy. And I know the police chief wanted a longer period of time and he didn't get it. So do you have that language to share with us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I'm trying to remember when we might have lengthened that retention period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unfortunately, I don't. My office reached out to the police department in my understanding and said it's generally six months, but if there is a head and the head is different because for the police departments they might be engaged in, for example, with the district attorney's office for a multi-year investigation that the district attorney would request.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there will be necessity to keep that data essentially until the case is well over. And that could be many, many, many years because it could be the prosecution, the appeal and any collateral appeals. And that's why the data, I believe, is stored longer with the police department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I unfortunately don't have the exact data. But we did inquire into the patient on this question. And my understanding is that it's six months and much longer to the extent necessary for any particular case for the police department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you know, I always like to follow the advice of our city attorney, but I was there at that vote, and that is not my recollection. I'm willing to say maybe my recollection is, but I, I well, this is what I would say and this is what I wrote in the notes that I don't see any reason'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that we would retain license plate data from. It's you know that's that's related to that has has turned out been a stolen car. And again once the a case is is ongoing. So there is a stolen car. So it's pursued.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of course, we're not going to destroy that data. In fact, I think there's even something in the policy that it then becomes it goes into an evidentiary file. That's something else. But for all others that are being looked into, I would want to make sure it was the same retention period as we use for police department powers'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and and not any longer. And I just looking at the council, I don't think any of you all were on that council with me. But anyway, Councilmember Vela, did you have your hand up or is that just your hand?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilman Rivera and new speaker. Well, I, I, I recall this conversation did come up when we were considering six Alpers. And I believe that your statement about it being only written for a year is correct, because I thought that was part of the discussion when we were talking about Six Alpers, which was an issue that came'",
        "'speaker_0': 'before the council, not this council, but the previous council was when I thought that conversation occurred, I did I did have also a question about the type of photographing technology that would be used, because, again, this was something that came up before with the six Alpers, which was what exactly getting photographed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is it just life and is there a way to crop it out for it or to small make it so that it's just limited to the license plate and even perhaps just the back of the vehicle? And that wouldn't necessarily include faces, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think Mr. Thomas has an answer for you, Mr. Thompson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you'll see that in our privacy impact analysis, this idea of making sure that the camera that's mounted on the vehicle, the parking technician vehicle, is directed down and focusing just on the license plate. You know, we don't care about somebody who might be sitting in the vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not our issue. The issue is literally just reading the license plate. And so one of the mitigations is the direction, how the camera should be directed when it's mounted on the vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I guess my question is, if there's something, would there be an instance where something else would get captured? And if something other than the license plate gets captured, are we going to be cropping the image?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I mean, in terms for the purposes of the parking management program, so there's two different LPR policies, the one that the mayor was talking about for the fixed, which is for fighting purposes. And then this LPR policy, which is for parking management, you know, for the, the, the, the mitigations that we were contemplating where first of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all, if your car is clean and you paid your parking, then we're not keeping any data at all. No, no photographs of any kind. They're being they're being deleted immediately. That day just erased. If your you have not paid your parking ticket and I do remember a process by which, you know, if we start seeing photographs coming'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up, which are just too broad, they they can be cropped. Now, once again, we would only be cropping photographs that we're keeping and those would be somebody who got a parking ticket or they came up with a stolen vehicle or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. I mean, I'm just I'm just thinking of a scenario where it's like in one of these lives, somebody walking with a small child who happens to be shorter and all of a sudden we start capturing other things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there going to be some sort of review mechanism to make sure that we're limiting what we're actually capturing?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that's. Well well, while you're taking public testimony, I'm going to go back and read through the impact mitigation just to verify that my recollection is correct. Once the third important and last piece of this I think is important in this policy is and the mitigation is this annual review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like, we do need to be checking on ourselves. We do need to make sure and I think that's one of those kinds of things that as part of the annual review and that's the reason I mentioned the vendor coming back to council, I think this is an evolving conversation really getting down to these kinds of specifics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it would make great sense to have that sort of annual review, include a review of, okay, let's see some of the photographs you've been keeping for a year. I mean, if we start seeing that it's getting sloppy, that we're catching all sorts of people and not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just license plates. It means we need to sort of, you know, clean up our program and do better training, frankly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or work with our or work with our contract vendor and say, hey, you need to clean up your program if you want to keep our contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And Mr. Shin. So. Mr. Chan, we can't hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've been able to obtain the APD LPR policy number for for 62. So I'm going to read the language to the council. Thank you. Requested the specific language. The language for the APD policy is that all LPR data downloaded to the server will be stored for a period of six months and thereafter shall be purged unless it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has become or it is reasonable to believe, to become evidence in a criminal or civil action, or is subject to a lawful action to produce records. In such instances, the applicable data shall be downloaded from the server onto portable media and stored into evidence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that that was the, the information I was attempting to convey, which is that it's six months unless there is a case pending, at which point it becomes evidence and it stays much longer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it doesn't say two years anywhere.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does not say two years, two years as the what the proposed in front of you. I think that the parallel is that what Mr. Thomas proposes for the 24 hours is close. The parallel there are six months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The two years. Here is the parallel to the somewhat less definite timeframe in the APD policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Yeah, I. Well, it would be great if. If you could maybe while we're hearing public testimony, if you could just email that over, cause I just, like I said, I, um, I do remember there are not a lot of times that I disagree with our police chief, quite frankly, but I really felt and it was one'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of those cases where we worked with the ACLU and the Oakland Privacy Project and, you know, trying to establish that balance between police needs, you know, crime fighting, crime solving needs and protection of civil liberties. And I just remember there was a one year limitation that didn't make the chief very happy, but, uh, and I just don't'",
        "'speaker_0': 'remember it coming back for modification since then. Um, but anyway, um, if there are no further. Mr. Thomas has his hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just very quickly. Yes, Councilmember Bell on that provision that everything will be cropped out of the photograph is actually already in the, in the impact thing. So any photograph will be kept for that, not a limit if it's not purged immediately that day, it is being kept because of a ahead or or not paying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then even still it's cropped if there's I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Guess my question is the sentence that comes after it that says personal identity information, call it connected. That cannot be technically. Obfuscated will be used solely for the purpose. What would that be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cheese. I have no idea if that's. Why don't you take public testimony? Let me. Let me read out. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's just the final sentence. Point number three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, that's a funny phrase when you think about that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, okay. So should we go to our public comments, counselor, or any other clarifying questions? Okay. Ms. ways here. Let's hear public comment, please. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have two. The first one is from Karen Bay, Mayor Marilyn Ashcraft, City Councilmember, City Manager Eric Leavitt and city staff for Alameda paid parking and our ferry terminals and city lots will be a new source of revenue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we have before us an exciting opportunity to use these revenues to fund high priority transportation projects. Parking revenue is something one of the highest sources of revenue for some cities. In my opinion. It's important that we separate the permit parking revenue from the daily parking revenue and manage these revenues differently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Permit parking is a more stable source of revenue, which could be used to fund some of the high priority transportation projects listed in the Transportation Choices Plan that currently have no funding sources. There are two projects that I list below for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One, as we move towards finalizing and implementing our public parking management plan and using public parking permit revenues to fund a smart city parking management system could be prioritized. Is state of the art automated parking management system can assist us with controlling operating costs, collecting pertinent data that will help us improve the management of public parking long'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and long term transportation planning. The second project is the Alameda shuttle funding. The Alameda back shuttle could provide shuttle services to our three ferry terminals and would be an important tool in getting more people out of their cars and getting more people to use public transportation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can expand the Alameda shuttle to provide citywide services as more funding becomes available. Finally, we could use the Oakland Broadway shuttle model, which is a partnership between the city and AC Transit. And ah, we could explore other models to determine which model works best for Alameda, but this is a great opportunity to fund this high priority'",
        "'speaker_1': 'project. Thanks for your consideration. Oh. And the next speaker is Jim Strelow. Lifelong resident of Alameda. Madame Mayor. Council Member Staff There is a major hole in the logic of your license plate recognition policy at Alameda Point. Your intent is to limit and manage how long people park at city run parking spots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The major overlooked flaw is with management of non city run parking spots. Look at Williams-Sonoma was warehouse at Viking Street and West Orange Ski Avenue. Businesses at Alameda Point have parking for their own business needs. Those businesses currently have no need whatsoever to watch who parks in their parking spots.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is no current demand for parking in front of those businesses for not doing business with them. But once the city opens up, Seaplane Lagoon and the new ferry location, vehicles will soon realize they can park for free in non city parking spots nearby.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There will be no license plate recognition at those free parking spaces. Those businesses will thereafter have to pay an employee to spend time to monitor their own business parking spots for scofflaws who are not doing business at their location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Their own business parking spots will become an attractive new nuisance to people who will want to avoid paying at the LPR parking spaces. A solution might be for the city to authorize these security monitoring service that currently patrols the area to report potential violators to a business contact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That service can then determine if there is a potential violation. And phone a tow truck service. But even at that, the city's license plate program will be a daily nuisance for businesses to mitigate. Your policy will spend lots of money for LPR equipment to monitor empty parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If people can park for free nearby, please fix your policy to plug that loophole. And that's the loudspeaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's the extent of our public speaker Public comment. So I will close public comment and we will return to council discussion. And I want to thank City Attorney Evenson for sending me that data retention policy for the purpose for the police department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can see that we were even stingier than I thought we were with data retention. And so what I'm saying is, and I don't know if Mr. Thomas has a copy of this, too, but I do data retention, which is just one paragraph long.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It says, in pertinent part, that all our data downloaded to the server will be stored for a period of six months and thereafter shall be purged. Unless it has become or it is reasonable to believe it will become evidence in a criminal or civil action, or is subject to a lawful action to produce records.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In those circumstances, the applicable data should be downloaded from the server onto portable media and broken into evidence, which I think is in your policy. But I would argue would I do want to argue, but I would suggest that if the police department is retaining data for six months, unless that that license plate is found to have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'been involved in a crime or a civil action, and then, you know that that takes it into the realm of evidence. I would think that it is reasonable to have to have the policy for the parking lot data also be retained for six months unless these other circumstances apply.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unless. I mean, Mr. Thomas, if you think there's a reason to retain parking. Right, Dad, want to make sure we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're saying the same thing here. So under the police department's current program, all data is kept for six months?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everything is kept for six months, and then it's deleted unless there is some reason to keep it for a for an actual crime or as part of evidence, what we're proposing to do is, unless this person has a ticket or is part of a crime with a stolen vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That data are data will be eliminated in 24 hours. So if you're saying no, if you're saying you want us to keep it for six months to reflect the police department's policies, then that would be that would be extending our how long we would be holding data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're maybe saying two different things. I'd say right now, your policy says license plates collected but not cited are not retained at all, and that that is different from the police department. But remember what this policy is governing and what this council I think is likely to approve, but I won't speak for my colleagues is a parking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'management program. The, um, the police department, they, they do keep data for six months unless it is a notice to be in a crime. So I. And the second bullet of yours is license plates for issued parking citations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I kept for two years, I. Don't understand why you would need two years to pursue someone who has a parking ticket. If I you know, if you again, if it's one of these vehicles, but then you're going to share that information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you have gotten hits on vehicles that are stolen or vehicles that I love the term, but scofflaws involved in some crime, you're going to you're going to turn that over to the police anyway. So could you help me understand why you think parking citation replace expired parking citations need to be kept two years?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, our thinking was you need you have to give people time to appeal. Parking tickets. So there's it might draw out. I mean, we look at San Francisco. I think they have if there's a if somebody's dealing with a parking ticket, they keep that information until it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I guess one clarification we could make clear is it's until resolved or two years, whichever is whichever comes first. I mean, if somebody comes in and pays their parking ticket the next day, we don't need to have that information for two years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The thought was after, if if it's still not resolved in two years, we're going to get rid of the information. I'm I don't know why. If you wanted to shorten it we couldn't to one year but I just want to make I mean those are that's the that's the information we're keeping for somebody who hasn't paid a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'parking ticket yet or had some problems. So we can shorten that if you'd like. I'm just don't know what top of my head right now, what would be too short? I mean, like I said, we're not interested in keeping information if we don't need it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Okay, well, I. I said those are, those are my views. I think that retention, um, is, you know, should be a reasonable length and reasonable minds could differ over what that is. But I don't want to take up all the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody, I think I set your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thanks, Andrew, for the presentation. That's typical of Andrew presentations. Very forward thinking, so I appreciate that. Um. I had the same recollection of the mayor that it was one year, but it was six, six months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wanted to question but then, you know, maybe a solution of that is, you know, we do they collected, not cited, not retained. And then we do a second category. If it being for some other reason, like it was stolen or involved in a crime, then it would go off into that other category like like we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have for our, our, our mobile readers and then maybe for, you know, issued. And I don't know how the technology works. I mean, two years does seem like a long time, but, you know, maybe six months after it's cleared or maybe after it's cleared or if it's not cleared, it stays till it's cleared.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know, something like that. But I get the analogy between the, you know, six months equating to the not retained and the two years equating to the, you know, as long as it's needed for evidence. Well, I guess what I'm trying to struggle with, you know, not so much this policy, but I'm trying to figure out'",
        "'speaker_2': ', like the use case how it would work. I mean, so are we like proposing getting rid of meters and getting rid of slips and or are we going to have both or do we just not know? Or because it's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tiny like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Picture how this would work in real life? Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, Thomas is going to look into the future for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We well, I speak first of all, it's this I have, but I have the benefit of working with a very talented group of other staff members. This has been an effort that's public work staff, police department staff have been working with us on this all along.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's a good collaboration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You do have a very talented group of staff people working on this. What we but this is how we've been thinking about it. We want to introduce this license plate readers first that allow me to point and the reason we were thinking Alameda point was to very first of all the two ferry terminals operating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were originally thinking at full steam with COVID 19. Our timing might be a little off, but the idea was and here we have these large areas around Main Street, which is completely unmarked, unmetered. This technology would be perfect for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then we have a situation at the Seaplane Lagoon, which is also very comparable, and this also addresses the speaker that spoke about the problems. We actually thought about that our the way we were going to use it at Alimi Point Seaplane Lagoon, obviously the the vehicle goes into the parking lot with 400 vehicles to check their license'",
        "'speaker_2': 'plates to make sure they're paid. What is nice about this technology for ferry riders in particular is you can walk to the booth and type in the license plate and say, I'm going to leave my car here all day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here's how you go and pay. Or you can literally do it on your phone, do it literally, park your car, jump on the ferry, and then pay for your parking space on the ferry. Ultimately, we see this expanding and using this citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you could start introducing it with street sweeping, I think Park Street, Webster Street, you know, Park Street garage or the municipal garage, the municipal lots, you might start integrating it in there because ultimately what you would be doing is you would be pulling out the old meters and instead putting in a pay by plate, sort of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'multi space booth. Or if somebody has already got the application on their phone and they're paying for their cars, they go to the ferry terminal a few days a week. And now there, if we start expanding the technology and this is I mean, which is a multi-year effort, this is not something we're thinking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just overhaul the entire city. One in one summer, it was we were sort of thinking we would be rolling it out. The ferry terminals, Harbor Bay Ferry Terminal was another one where we felt like it would be very easy to implement it and use the technology there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we'd be sort of but still have the meters on Park Street until further notice. That was sort of how we were thinking about it. The other thing just real quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Rodi Yeah, I think so. I mean, I, I was picturing robots and, you know, like the Hayward, I think has a robot in their garage. And I know that the airports have like the license plate that charges to your fast track and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So anyway, whether it's you or a group of people are very forward thinking. So I appreciate this and you know, I, I am open and probably would prefer not keeping a clear citations for. Two years or so, I'm open to hearing what my colleagues think would be a better a better retention for those.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think the city vice mayor. Stand up or. No, no. Okay. Anyone else have any comments? Okay. I that is the vice mayor said sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I my mike wasn't on, but I was saying I'd be happy to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah. My lip reading skills are not. They're not up to par.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's all good. Just. It's just a couple. I really want to just say how thankful I am to have this here. I think city staff across the board has done a fabulous job. I really appreciated our staff working very directly with Secure Justice to get input from the privacy community who are not here supporting or not supporting'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this, but who gave a lot of input and really helped make sure that what we ended up with was a report that even though we have yet to adopt a, a, um, a surveillance policy. Yet back in January we gave direction to use San Francisco intel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have. And so this, uh, this is the first one that's come forward with a report that actually says when we're going to do surveillance stuff, this is the type of information we have so that we're having a mindful conversation about it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know it took a little bit of learning, but I just wanted to give Andrew and his team and everybody big props for that. Thank you very much. I think this is fabulous. I do think and I had looked through here for public works director in the current language Public Works Director as mentioned from Public Works'",
        "'speaker_3': 'stuff, whether it's paint, etc.. I do know the one place I would in having nothing to do with our current public works director who actually gets this and has let our parking conversations in the past. But as as rules have changed in the city over over time, I would consider at least putting the city manager in there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'right now. We're moving it from the council. I would say the city manager or designee would be the person. I just think it makes it cleaner. And it's an odd place for the pricing parking pricing policy or sorry, parking pricing policy to live at the public works director, because the pricing itself is not based on any sort'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of public infrastructure decision making. So but that's not the direction of the council. That's fine. I'd look for to support this either way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over and I have a quick question before I call on Mr. de SAC and Mr. Thomas and the data retention policy is that the length of time is that that length of time taken from other cities policies? Where did that come from?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We looked at I don't remember exactly where the two came from the two years, but we do have also a very good parking consultant has been helping us with this. I did some of the excellent staff that's been working on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've been furiously texting me during this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What did we do before? Text messages?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just got a text saying, you know, we could probably make one year work, but bureaucracy takes time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that I mean, what I was going to say is I don't want to get hung up over something like that. And I, you know, I, um, if I get parking citations, I pay them. So, I mean, maybe, maybe they really do take two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I assume you didn't just call that. You remember that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If the council wants to shorten it to two years, we can wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is two years. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I mean 2 to 1 year. Sorry. You want to do it to turn it to one year. We can work with that. And then another thing is we're going to have to then start working with selecting a vendor, bringing that vendor back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've got that whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Conversation probably again when the vendor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right, Anderson, let's hear. I'm mindful of the fact that it's 930 and we were just an item six. But and I know Mr. de SAC has had his hand up, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Desai Well, thank you. Two points. One is, um, I really like the ordinance. I think, um, citizen Karen Bay summarized it best, but I especially like the ordinance and how it improves the way residents pay their parking fees or whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, I also like the ordinance. Um, just because the way that, that we will going forward fund certain transportation projects, I certainly welcome the ordinance. And second, that the second point, though, is, you know, I'm not a fan of the license plate reading policy, quite frankly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And frankly, it doesn't really have to do with the privacy issues that people have spoken about tonight as well as in the past and in the in the far past. Um, quite frankly, I don't, you know, as one of five council members, I prefer the old way of identifying people who haven't paid their, their parking fees and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the old way of assessing parking tickets. Granted, it's less efficient, it's less revenue generating, but, uh, you know, doing license plate reading. To do. For parking tickets and violations. I really think we we run the risk of having a parking ticket regime that's just completely on steroids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I prefer the old way of doing things. I would hope that we separate the policy from the authorities, because I think this audit, for the most part, is silent on on on the on the license plate reading aspect of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nice discussion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. So I think we've all been heard from and I do see that our colleague, Councilmember Vela, has slipped out of view, but she might be putting a baby to bed and she's back in the nick of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela, um, are you ready to. Did you want to say anything more silly? But should we do? I was ready to support. And I'm ready to support approval of this ceremony. Yes, taking into account. But I would like to only retain the information for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One year instead of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Two years. So we were talking about a little bit and she filed the whole thing. And apparently Mr. Thomas, his staff has been furiously texting to him and they just let him know that while they could shorten it to a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bureaucracy takes time to get through the citations. Uh, I. But we're, we're retaining. We're retaining any evidence that there's an evidentiary need. So somebody is contesting it. They're still going to. They're still going to be able to to hold it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just don't see how a bureaucracy would allow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Require us to send out a ticket two years after the fact or something like that. I think it might be the court case pursuing it if indeed, but then it would be in an evidentiary file. I've seen our city attorney not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are you now, Mr. Shad? Actually, I was in a band and Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vela is right. If there is a judicial proceeding, the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Existing policy would allow staff to download it into an evidentiary file and keep it for the duration of the judicial proceeding, which will probably go beyond two years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But it would be initiated inside of two years and hopefully inside of one year. Correct. So that. Yes. Yes, it certainly would. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In fact, the statute of limitation requires that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So all right. So then if I understand, I think you just stated it that you you are moving approval of the amendment to the municipal code and approving the policy for the use of the appears with the modification that the retention period be limited to one year in the case of parking citation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Which who is that so councilor. Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I like to separate out the ordinance itself from the other items and have a separate vote on on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll ask the maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Actually, I think that's mandatory. If he asks for it, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tip I forgave.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Laura. About second whichever motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um. Well, I don't mind. Is it? I mean, whatever. We need to move things along to move forward, whatever. Whatever we need to do. I don't. I don't. I'm fine bifurcating. Okay, that moves it along. Yeah, let's do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can. You can be the maker of both if you like. That's fine. Okay. So we've got a motion that's on the ordinance. Okay. All right. So the ordinance amending the municipal code corrects.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And 72nd. That was you council every day. So I forget. Roll call, vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember De Sang.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Knox.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wait.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Odie. Just Bella. I may or as he Ashcraft I that carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Second motion on the policy for the use of automated license plate readers. Motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll move approval and if somebody wants to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. It's been approved. And live by vice mayor, seconded by Councilmember Bellamy. We have a real cover, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'High. Odie Yes, that's was the amendment that Melissa talked about earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor as he Ashcraft High that carries 4 to 1 with Councilmember Dysart voting no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. Thomas. Good report. Good work to all of the staff who worked with you. Thank you. All right. With that, we close out item six A and we move on to item six B, but I bet Mr. Thomas is staying public here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can I just say at the outset that it is 930, we've got a few more items to to cover. So let's be as expeditiously as possible and getting through this next.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public hearing to consider accepting an interim report on the status of the general plan and housing element, an annual report on the status of the Transportation Choices Plan and Associated Work Program Priorities. And an annual report on the West Alameda Transportation Management Association.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you ready for me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. I missed my sitter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think we have to read the sequel language. I think we was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You okay? You're fine. Yeah, I. We just lost you for a minute there. Okay. No, it's all good. Okay, Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, Mayor Ashcraft.'",

    "Annual Reports on General Plan, Housing Element, Transportation Choices Plan, and West Alameda TMA.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am good. Thank you for having me back. Um, I'm going to be. I'm going to do this very quickly and just make myself available to answer questions. This is an annual report on the general plan, the and the housing element and our transportation planning efforts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm just going to hit some highlights. I'm available to answer any questions. This is sort of that annual opportunity to kind of take, you know, take stock of where we're at and think about where we want to go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been an unusual 12 months. Ten months. The first ten were very normal. They're working on all the things we've been talking about working on. And then the last two months, everything sort of changed, particularly from a transportation perspective.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But before we get there, let's just talk about the general plan. I think the council is well aware we have been working on our general plan update for the city of Alameda. Many of those elements of the plan have not been updated comprehensively since 1990, so it was time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we've been posting the new elements on the city website. We will. We have them all up. We're just about to post the final one, which is the update of the transportation element. So if anybody is interested, go to the city website.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to be working with the planning board to start forums on that at late spring or early summer. So that is going to be exciting. What it really does is it talks about the need for change in planning for change over the next 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're in a changing region. Climate change is a big theme throughout the plan, improving mobility and transportation options and of course, dealing with our housing opportunities in our housing needs. We that is not an issue that we see going away over the next 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have to plan for that. And this provides us a an opportunity to really think about this from a city wide perspective before diving into the housing element update in the next year or so. Obviously preserving neighborhoods and our business districts is a big push.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm pleased to say that any new general plan update that we've posted really I think, puts a much bigger stress on economic development, the need of our business community. And then along comes COVID, and it sort of really emphasizes that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think in that respect, we have a very good first draft up, but at this point, the council should probably just sit back and watch as the community tells us what they think. First housing element. We're working our way through this housing element period.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every year we have to report to the state how we're doing. 2019, which is the reporting year, was a good year for Alameda. We issued building permits for over 600 housing units. We are more than halfway through our eight year period council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As the Council knows, our regional housing need for this eight year period is about 1700 housing units. About the need is that about 100,000 of those are for lower income households. So obviously that's about 66%. I mean, that's a huge portion and a big, big hurdle to climb or get over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The good news is we're on track to meeting our regional housing needs in terms of numbers. If we keep on track, we will by the end of the period in 20 2021, 2022, we should have built our 1725 units.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A big part of that is because a couple of big projects got started in 2019, and we can continue to work through codes that are still under construction today. The boat works or excuse me, the Del Monte Project, Alameda Marina Project inside a phase one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those are the big three. And then of course, we recently re-approved the Boat Works Project, so we've got our fingers crossed that that will actually start to break ground in the next couple of years. Of course, the two big challenges around housing element.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like every city in the Bay Area, we're struggling to get enough affordable housing that we still have a very real housing crisis, affordable housing crisis here in Alameda. We're doing a good job building affordable housing, but it's just not enough.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this summer, we should be getting the revised schedules for the next regional housing need. The region should be getting its. Bur this summer we probably won't have ours till the following January, but it's going to be very we're going to learn a lot when we see the regions number and that will help us forecast what our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'number will be. So that's what we're looking at in terms of housing element, transportation plan update. First ten months, we were just plowing along, doing great. Alameda The active transportation planning effort. The council was taking a real leadership role and very active role, pushing us on things like Vision Zero and our Vision Zero policies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are you just recently approved lane width policy? So we were we were chugging along COVID 19, then showed up and things all of a sudden shifted. The good news is we've been able to continue working with our consultants and staff, you know, just remotely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're still working on those plans. But some of the things we've also started to think about and work on, of course, the Slow Streets program, which is just one week old now, we've been have we have a survey out 75% of the people responding to the survey gave it a big thumbs up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, lots of suggestions about how it should be expanded, changed, improved. So that'll be that's taken on sort of a life of its own. We're also working with Park Street and Webster Street, looking at their proposals to try to create some more space for for the business community by reducing the number of travel lanes on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Park and Webster Street. So these are two things that are we're actively working on right now in transportation, which, you know, if you had asked about this just six months ago, we're like, no, no, we're not. That's crazy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're not thinking of working on those kinds of things, but now we are. So the transportation group and this is the transportation planning staff and the public works staff really working together. Our public work staff has been doing a great job helping us work through these issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a couple of last things I just wanted to point out on transportation. You've all seen the projections and not the projections. The reality of what has happened to transit ridership in the last two months is, you know, a transit we just have gone down to, you know, 10% of their normal ridership.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So all these services to all our transit services, nobody's riding them. We have done a couple of things in response to that, which I would have never have been anticipated three months ago. But with what we are doing right now is we've suspended the supplemental fees for the line 19 because all of a sudden AC transit stopped'",
        "'speaker_2': 'running them. So we are not funding the supplemental transit service for the line 19 right now because they're just able to provide basically a Sunday service. So we we've put a halt to the supplemental service for line 19.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We were planning on funding supplemental service for line 96 starting in August. But that doesn't make sense right now. We don't want to pay money for a service that nobody is riding. So what we've talked to AC Transit about is just slowing that down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And instead of making the decision today to have that supplemental bus service funded in August, we've delayed it for six months. So the go no go day will be December of this year to decide whether we want to fund the supplemental service starting in March of next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're also actively talking and meeting with Leda on a weekly basis to talk about their return to normal and their plan. As you all know, we do not have our regular ferry service from Harbor Bay and Main Street today like we did just a month or so ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So how we do turns on service in Alameda and what rates and which terminals get turned on when is is a conversation that we are actively involved in with them right now. Frankly, this this two months has given us an opportunity, all of us with also our TMA and our looking at our, our, our TMA and what'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we do for TDM and our TDM requirements on new projects. It's giving us an opportunity to kind of rethink all of that. We may end up rethinking it and come back with the exact same game plan that we had before COVID.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But this it's there's lots of interesting questions about how does transit recover, how many people continue to work from home, not just city staff, but just general, you know, people who normally were commuting five days a week while they still commute five days a week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the future. I know leaders thinking there is going to be a lot more demand for mid-day service because people won't be working half days and working from home half day. So everything is changing. And we're really it's going to be an interesting six months ahead of us as we help the community plan for recovery, but also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as we work with our transit agency partners and decide how best we can help them with our resources. Because we do have resources that the Council has put in place through private development impact fees and annual assessments. So we have resources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The interesting question is how do we best use them as we move forward? And it may not be the same way we're thinking six months ago, it might be different. So with that, I will wrap up my presentation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm available to answer questions on any of these issues. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I just before we start with the council clarifying questions and then go to public comment. I just want members of the public who are watching this presentation to know that Andrew Thomas is a longtime valued member of this staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And right now, in addition to everything he's doing, leading the planning, building and Transportation Department, he also has a pivotal role at our emergency operations center and I believe is one of the team of city staff who are planning the transition back to whatever the new normal looks like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for all the hats you wear so well, Mr. Thomas. And with that, let's do it, madam. Quick. Do we have public comment on this item?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have one speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well, we will take any clarifying questions about the staff report, and then we'll hear our public speaker and we'll come back to discussion and wrap up. Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. That one really brief question. I noticed Roseville Village was listed there as counting towards our housing elements. Are those 80 replacing and is there a replacing? Are we allowed to do that? Because we're not really adding? Yeah, I hope it does, is that the project is an expansion of Roseville Village.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't remember the exact numbers off the top of my head. I have it right in my fingertips. But you're right. We don't get credit for the existing units, just the new units. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any more clarifying questions before we take our public comment? Okay. We'll be back. Madam Clerk. Public comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is from Ruth Abby from community the action for sustainable Alameda. Mayor Ashcroft, members of the city council, thank you for your leadership and support of the transportation initiatives that keep our pedestrians and bicyclists safe and provide alternatives for Alameda to get out of their cars and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Community Action for Sustainable Alameda is pleased to be a partner with the city in the Line 19 BART Shuttle Outreach Project and we look forward to continuing to support the development of the active transportation plan. Special thanks to transportation staff Gail Payne and Rochelle Wheeler, who go above and beyond in their diligence and inclusiveness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our community is so fortunate to have them as public servants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that comment. And um, I will just note that we've heard two public speakers tonight, Ruth, Abby from Casa and earlier Debbie Ryan from Casa. And those two ladies were my choices for this year's Grand Marshals for the 4th of July parade.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But rest assured, we will we will find a way to to recognize you. You know what? I've just gotten a text message, Madam Clerk, from a viewer who says there's no sound to the TV audience for the last 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. We got a text, too, and a couple people tell us and it's working again now, we understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Working again. Okay. Good to hear. All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did nothing different in the room, so we're not sure what happened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh, the gremlins. Okay, so. Okay, so what we are asked to do on this, this very important report is to, um, to hold the public hearing and endorse by motion the General Planning and Housing Element Annual Report Transportation Choices Plan Annual Report in the West Alameda Transportation Management Agency Annual Report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And let's hear from council and let's have a vote. Who wants to start?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, first item of approval of all three items, and that way someone could second after everyone talks. Um, real quick, thank you for this. Um, I'm concerned about transportation, you know, whether or not it turns out to be reality or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I read a poll maybe two weeks ago that 75% of the people would not cut back on public transportation. And it was it was consistent among demographics, whether you're Democrat or Republican, conservative, liberal men, women, racial age. So I think that's a challenge that we'll have to work on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's my only comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I think I saw vice mayor and then councilmember today. So they did not see you. Okay. Sorry if I say Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a second. The motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, we have a motion. We have a second. Any further discussion? Okay, now I see a hand count for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Pushing my glasses up, and Tony hand was upset. Didn't want to step in front of him.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You guys don't make it easy on me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I keep trying to duck down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I try to reach. I try to read your mind. And it's just going nowhere. So, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the spirit of brevity, I just want to in the end and, uh, the, uh, building planning and transportation director Andrew Thomas said it, well, our transit is in trouble. Not only is it funded by my fare box, it's also funded by sales tax, which we just lost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, you know, I read this and it and quite honestly, it was such an exciting report. And at the same time, the next steps for 2020 are so much like, Oh yeah, we're not doing that. We're going to spend so much of the next 6 to 12 months just trying to put the system back together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I and I appreciate the acknowledgment of that. So I will I will gladly support this moving forward tonight. But I also would like to do so kind of with the idea that we're going to be we're going to be making sure that as we're focusing on what we're doing over the next six and eight months is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not just supporting how transit comes back, but supporting the things we do have control on and making sure that the money, whether it's the transportation money that we're getting from assets, etc., which comes in from sales tax that we're putting that in the priority places, the policy priority places of this council that is driving how we're making'",
        "'speaker_3': 'funding decisions as less money is moving forward than we were hoping for. I'd also, you know, once this is done, I'd like to make a motion for for direction. So for after this, if I could come back, I'd like to share it just briefly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. So we have a motion. We have a second. Do we have any further discussion? Hearing, then maybe we have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Member disagree?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not quite. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor. As the Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Perfect. And then vice mayor, next, why you wanted to come back with that motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did, yes. Thank you. Safe Streets was not on the agenda tonight for discussion, but I would like the opportunity to have a conversation about that. This important program, which is all about social distancing, which will be with us for at least 12 more months, is going to is going to be a part of our community conversation'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for for four months to come. And I'd like a chance for the Council to have some conversation about that as well. So I'd like to make a motion to provide direction to staff to bring that back at our next meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It doesn't need to be a staff report, it can be an oral report. But I just I got an opportunity to kind of talk about it and make sure that we're all on the same page and moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Is there a second to that motion? Also. You're talking about the slow streets, John.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. Okay. So that's a motion to give staff direction, to bring that program back for discussion to count.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On May 19th.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, at the next meeting, if possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, that's what I'm saying. I don't need a staffer personally. I don't need a staff report. I think we can just have them bring the map in and ask for a comfortable discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I might like to hear from the city manager just because I know that the staff reports all have to be out by this Thursday. Right. Mr. Leavitt, what do you think?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Yeah, that would be very difficult. Other than especially if he did enter a special meeting. Maybe. But it's that would be difficult on May, May 19th, because the staff reports are due tomorrow. Tomorrow are not due tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're they're finalized as far as review. Tomorrow is what they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Okay. I guess we'll do it in June when it's, you know, I'm sorry. I had planned on bringing it as a referral. I thought we were going to have the opportunity to be able to talk about it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I didn't file for referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, I have a question. I'll get you just a minute. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Question Well, Councilmember Vela. Yeah, I was just wondering if if the vice mayor is just asking that it be agenda so that there can be a council discussion about it or a council Q&A and perhaps we can get it agendas that way, or perhaps at least maybe we can get an update.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the Brown Act makes it difficult for us to converse about it. And I don't think that he's at least from my perspective, I'm not necessarily looking for a staff report. I don't know that he is either.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it would perhaps just provide an opportunity for council conversation and discussion without necessarily a staff report. Um, so my feedback is, I think waiting two more weeks to hear this has benefits because I want more than just the council talking about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want benefit of staff input and I think there's even some legal issues we should be aware of. And so, um, right now we've got, um, we've got our two streets that are open and I know staff is looking at some others and maybe even another facility elsewhere in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, but, um, I, I just, I would want more because the thing is, so we bring it back and then we give staff direction to come to us at the next meeting. Wouldn't couldn't we just. Say that as soon as I'm trying to be respectful of all the things staff is doing to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'll let staff determine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How quickly am I? I call on speaker, sir. I've got Mr. Otis. Hand up Mr. Otis for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ernie. I know that one of the places that are designated now is within 500 feet of where I live. So can I begin this discussion? If if it is within 500 feet of where you live, I'd recommend you reduce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Amount of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, unless unless it's about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Mr. Vice Mayor, if you to just wait for me to call on you. I will. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry. Even if my interest is in having a citywide conversation about this program, not discussing Pacific Avenue where Jim lives. So I guess as it comes forward, hopefully you can think through that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In short time. Okay. So, um. Your motion is what? Again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess my motion is to bring it back as soon as possible before future streets are rolled out so that we can have a conversation about how this program is moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, Mr. Levitt, would that would it be reasonable to get it on the first June meeting?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, the first June meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, okay. So is there a second Councilmember Avella? I'll second it. I just I want to have a I do have a question about if there's going to be any changes or elimination of STS prior to that date.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's like, are there going to be any major decisions being made prior to series? Here's the problem, and I'll let Mr. Shen, our city attorney, answer that. This item is not a generalized. And you tell us if you would, Mr. City Attorney, but how much how far can we go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so given that this is not agenda related to the item, my advice of the Council's brief direction to staff to bring back whatever the Council wishes to hear, and staff will bring it back to you so that we don't generate a discussion on an item that's not on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we've had a motion. It's been seconded. Maybe we have a roll call vote, said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de Sung.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We've been going for actually, we've been going for 4 hours straight because we started closed session at six. So it is 1001. Let's be back at. Okay, 1015. We're starting. So be bend your seats a little bit before to log in if you would.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, and I cannot tell you how excited I am about this plan and which of our public works staff is present here on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. As you Ashcraft, members of council, you know, you get.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The nod now that this is our assistant city manager, Jerry Byrd, and we're happy to have you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. And my mike is working, so. That's great. So good. Yeah. So I'm really fortunate tonight to be here with Patrick Pellegrino Day, our climate action coordinator, and Liam Garland, our public works director, to present this item. It just a quick shout out to the two of these folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's really a pleasure to work on the Caap implementation with Patrick and Liam. Passionate about the topic, innovative and really just instrumental in developing the plan and leading the way on key components of the development and implementation that we're working on now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also a whole host of other members of staff across the organization who are working on this. So as you know, we're recommending adoption or excuse me, acceptance of the 2020 annual report tonight for the the 2019 Climate Action Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The timing of this is a little in advance of what would be a year for the plan, but we are trying to align it with the transportation plan annual report that you just heard earlier tonight, because in addition to the dozens of strategies that are in the carp, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is really a big part of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'it, and that transportation plan helps to do that. That's another focus of the plan is also sequestering carbon. And then a final strategy or list of strategies are around building resilience to change related to climate impacts for the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The plan was adopted on September 3rd, 2019. Three key goals reducing greenhouse gas emissions adaptation to climate change. And then the third is what we're here talking about tonight. It's really the effective implementation and capacity building to ensure that the plan comes to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was really important to the city council when the plan was adopted, and it's important for all the plans that we work on. But for this plan in particular, because climate change is really is a really important topic for this year for the city of alameda and the community as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A cornerstone of the caap is the the annual report and this is our first annual report for this document. So it's worth summarizing the progress where we're basically looking at some key metrics that we've put together into a dashboard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we've launched that dashboard publicly. And I'll talk a little bit more about that in a few minutes. And then we're describing the next steps for the near medium and longer term actions associated with the plan and is our first effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we really want to make sure that we're hitting the high highlights, but also hearing from council, if there are things that you'd like to hear from us, hear more about or you'd like built into future plans, feel free to give us that information tonight or going forward as as part of as part of other communications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And before I really get into the details of the annual report, the three pillars of sustainability are mentioned in the in the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan there, the economy, the environment and equity. And we all know that with the coronavirus right now, all three all three of those pillars are being pretty significantly impacted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we have taken the time to step back, look at the plan, and we remain confident that we'll be able to move forward with the implementation. But much like some of our transportation efforts, there'll be new challenges that we'll have to face as we come through the COVID 19 public health pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, I'll move on to the highlights and accomplishments. They're called out in pretty significant amount of detail in the the annual report, but also in the appendix, which does summarize the action steps that have been taken so far.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just give a few examples tonight. In January, Alameda Municipal Power went to providing 100% clean power for the community. The council passed a resolution requiring all electric vehicle development for new residential projects on city owned land. And we also property say we but it really is the royal we in this case property owners in the community'",
        "'speaker_2': 'passed out water quality and flood protection fee that will help us improve our our overall infrastructure. And looking ahead, we're focusing on some near-term projects like our communications plan, our master tree plan update. We're also moving forward with design work for Veteran's Court, which will translate into a longer term capital investment and and physical improvements for that'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Partners on our Doolittle Drive and flooding at the entrances to our at the entrance to our tubes which are significant infrastructure projects more than likely for us and will involve significant budget and planning processes. Just going back to the carp for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have over 200 action items in our Climate Action Plan. The appendix that we attach to the annual report includes updates on about 35 of those action items. In our first what was a six month update for you when we initially plan to bring this forward on March 17th?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's now been eight months, but like Anja was saying earlier, it's been the last couple of months have been more about planning for what might be in the next fiscal year. And so we're we're still working on some of those those priorities that have been identified, but we expect to gain momentum again.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then in the coming months on our climate action efforts, we do engage with a number of agencies and other groups around the state and the country where we're also really focused on our local partners. CASA Bruce and Debi were mentioned earlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Casa in particular has been instrumental in supporting the development of the plan and we see them as key players as we move toward or we move forward with our implementation efforts. And I mentioned it just briefly, but before I wrap up, I really want to give a shout out to Patrick, who was able to take a series'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of ideas that we had around around indicators and metrics and turn it into a dashboard for us. The dashboard will continue to evolve. We've we've obviously just gotten started with the implementation. So a lot of the data is just is just getting started.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we've planted those seeds. And you can take a look at our dashboard on the the Climate Action and Resilience Plan website. If you if you search for if you search for city of Alameda Karp, you'll end up on the Web page.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the first paragraph has a hot link to our to our our new dashboard. And some of the key metrics are in the areas of transportation, sea level rise and energy. So you'll be able to see what we're doing in those areas and be able to track over time our progress.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Not currently, no. And that the proposal would allow future councils.

        "'speaker_3': 'Well, currently, there's no language about health benefits currently. I mean, would you know, it's very strictly our city charter says we make $50 per meeting. It does not talk about city health benefits. It doesn't talk about technology and car allowances, etc., the things that we do actually still collect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think what this would do would not be this council adding yet another $15,000 on to $30,000 in or 20 to $25000 in health benefits, which some some past council members have taken. I'm not I haven't looked up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What? I haven't looked up who's taking what? Yeah. On the current council. But in the past, some council members have funded their their family health coverage through the city council. We have two other elected officials who do that as well.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. This does not past past versions talked about the city charter and treasurer currently that the charter gives the the setting of the compensation for the charter for the auditor and the Treasurer to the City Council. This would not change that in any way.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'The first one is for mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Since. Since the comments maybe on also measure two. Can we quickly just go?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought we did, but we did not. Okay. Yes. Let's go.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The entire staff report and then we'll have our public comments. Take it away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am assuming I am assuming that this one will be even clearer because they are all items we have more or less spoken about. But the second measure so we we we did propose in these move forward is one but we proposed doing them as two separate measures would be to allow language to allow the city prosecutor'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to commit crimes committed crimes, prosecute crimes. But that doesn't sound right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To do crimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Without prior to district attorney requesting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're not allowing that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Currently, the the city prosecutor has made that request and has received that permission. But last September when we adopted the, uh, the language appointing or creating the city prosecutor position and whatnot, we also said we'd like to look at amending the city charter to provide this direction so that it's clear for all future years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also clarify that the absence, that absence in remote meeting participation rules. We need to make some clarifications that when your parent time family care COVID that that there are times in which remote meeting is perfectly acceptable and you can do it from the city, etc..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it would I would call bringing it bringing our charter up to the modern world. Obviously not something where you just decide not to come to the council on a Tuesday. But there are some very, very real and good reasons why people might want to phone in or video in so that they can take care of children'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and family members or COVID pandemics. And then lastly, we just wanted to if staff had any clean up language they wanted to present to us, that would also come back to Councilmember SACS point. I think at least in my mind, the three meetings we're having on the charter this week, depending on what direction is given, at the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'end of the day, we would have one meeting sometime in June or July where we would kind of determine and determine which which all some whatever of the ones that we said, why don't we bring these back for future discussion will go on the ballot so that we would have be able to have that kind of balance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and conversation all at once. So those are the those are them. We had proposed a couple of community task force. Obviously, this is not the time for community task forces. So once the COVID emergency kind of has passed, we would recommend some form of task force on campaign finance and ethics reform.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would think that the Mayor would appoint two council members to do that. And, uh, Council de SAC is the also I'll let you speak about it, Tony, but I wanted also to suggest the idea of a task force on District 11 elections.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was something that came forward just just from Councilmember de SAC, but we wanted it to be captured.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From Councilmember de SA. What would you like to say about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I think at some point in time we might want to take a look at, um, uh, having district council members represent districts. And there's a lot of great models across the state of California, but certainly one of the impetus is as more and more cities, by virtue of being pressed by legal challenges, and also more and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'more cities just out of a desire to have council members represent certain geographic areas. Um, even here within Alameda County are turning to district elections. But also I think we might want to take a look at district elections from the lens of a form of campaign finance reform in the sense that, you know, having to campaign for'",
        "'speaker_2': 'districts could potentially cost less money, depending on the depending on the form of districts that you take. And by just if I can say quickly what I mean by different models. For example, our neighborhood neighboring city of San Leandro has districts, but each council member represents a district, a given geographic area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, in order to represent that district, they have to be voted on citywide. So that's an interesting model in terms of district elections. But the classic district model is certainly, you know, you represent a certain geographic area and my light to gone out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But so that's about it. And I think sometime in the we can I agree that we can hold off the discussion on district of elections potentially by inviting even more people to give us their insights, like the League of Women Voters as well as Alameda Citizens Task Force, etc..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. So now we've covered the staff report. Okay. Any clarifying questions before we go to our public speakers? Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And thank the two of you for your work. So are we not being asked to consider the last two items or we are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The task forces and the district's election is that the task.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Forces task to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Work with two task forces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't believe it was my intention to ask the council to consider tonight. Obviously, at the end of the day that whatever the recommendation is going forward tonight is the council's will. And so if they thought one or the other was worthwhile and saying, let's do that, and then we could start in September, we can now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly wouldn't be against it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I won't talk about it unless others do. All right. And if I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Councilmember de CYC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought our specific marching orders from several weeks ago was to kind of narrow down this initial list. So that's why Vice Mayor Knox White and I have the two items as kind of the headlining items and the other things kind of as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll pick it up later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Understood. Thank you. Um, okay. Let's have our public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. The first one is Janet Gibson, who's an Alameda resident. Dear Mayor and Council Members. Alameda Voters want charter discussions to be inclusive and transparent. We respectfully request that the Council postpone these important discussions until our governor lifts the shelter in place.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Order. If ever there were a time for City Council members to listen to your constituent, it is now tonight. You have received many letters asking for you to pause these discussions. But. Three are particularly significant letters from Alameda League of Women Voters, Alameda Citizens Task Force, an Alameda Architectural Preservation Society.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These letters are especially important because each organization represents hundreds of Alameda citizens. What is everyone asking for? They are asking that you respect the limiting conditions of all of us are living under during this pandemic period. The situation makes all of us unable to engage in serious deliberation over the important issues that will affect the future of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alameda. Voters are asking that you postpone these charter discussions. If you want potential charter amendments to pass at the polls, the process must be trusted by the voters. You've got to get the wording right. And although that's essential over the long run, our city can function well while we work on forming a consensus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then the next speaker is Patricia Gannon, who's also an Alameda resident. Honorable mayor as he Ashcraft, an honorable members of the Alameda City Council. I am following up on my letter of April 22nd regarding this topic. This is a complex and complicated issue which deserves to be fully debated in person by council members in an open'",
        "'speaker_1': 'setting so that Alameda citizens have a full understanding of the issue and have an opportunity to express their views fully in person. With the City Council at a meeting in council chambers, as convenient as matters to modern technology may be, sometimes the old fashioned way is the best way to proceed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's absolutely no pressure to push this forward. I again urge the Council to table this issue until social distancing is ended and the myriad issues can be fully debated in an open setting. If the Council does decide to move forward, I fully support the recommendations of the Army two citizen task force submitted in its letter dated May'",
        "'speaker_1': '4th, 2020. Thank you for your consideration. And that's the last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, then with that we will close public comment. Um. Okay. So now. We go to a council comment and then we'll see what we what we decide. So I would like to start. As I say, I'm happy to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But do you want to start today? So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I'd like to offer this comment. I think the comments raised by the members in the public comment portion, as well as the volumes of emails that we had received, um, uh, are right. But for different reasons. Um.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the data clearly shows that the City Council of Alameda for generations has been underpaid. I think the data clearly shows that, and I think the reasonable resident will see the data and then come to the same conclusion that that we're not a city council that's asking for for a change to the charter when it comes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to pay. Insofar as the request is is grounded in the data that was before us is not we're not asking for the moon. I think it's reasonable in relationship to the to to what's around us. But I think, though, that as significant as this request is, I think we all know that any time that you have a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'request for a pay increase, it becomes a form of political football. And if it's going to be a form of a political football, I'm really concerned about this because I believe that there are two other items that we are going to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we can't we can't discuss it tonight because they're going to they're going to be discussed on the in the following days. And my concern is, any time you have pay, that it becomes a form of a political football and it could become an unwelcome distraction as we tackle the of the two one of the two other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'items that it could become a unwelcome distraction. So. I'm okay with postponing this until I understand where we are with the other two. At which point in time I would make it. I think we should then come back to this and figure out if we're going to put it, if we want to move forward to bring it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to the voters. But I think there are two other items, though, that if we all if we bring up all three together, it could become an unwelcome distraction. And for that reason, I, I certainly support postponing it for now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm postponing I'm supporting the notion of postponing, but for different reasons, not not necessarily because of COVID 19, but because of how we position this or anything it or anything else. This coming November, if there is to be a November vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm gonna go next. I have paid close attention to the many emails, voicemails, the public comments we just heard. And. And I respect all of your opinions. But I also want to make a few things clear. First of all, the council is not voting to amend the charter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The council will vote on whether or not to consider allowing or to allow the voters to amend the charter. To amend the charter. We will put forth proposals if we have a majority to do that and we'll take it to the voters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is democracy. And while it is true that we are under a shelter in place order, there is still the need for government to move forward to function. You heard the items, many of them that we just discussed and approved and moved on earlier today have to do with the city moving forward in a responsible manner.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I also want to point out a few things about this notion that the only way we can have full participatory democracy in our city is if we all are allowed to come to city council, fill the chambers, make our voices heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, we are all adjusting and adapting to a new reality, and none of us is, at least I don't think on this council is anticipating that we're going to go back to the days of filling the chamber because we are still going to need to practice social distancing, whether it's in our schools, our restaurants, our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is the new reality that's going to keep us healthy. The other thing for all of the seniors out there to keep in mind is the governor's orders have specified limitations on what seniors can do in public. And I believe the golf resumption excludes people 65 and over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think you'd want to be told that you can't come and speak to your council because it's not healthy for you to do so. But the ability to participate from the comfort of your own home. Submitting your comments by email, voicemail, or text message that are heard by the Council and considered and made a part of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the record gives you your ability to speak and in some ways makes it even more convenient for the parent of a young child, for someone who would need to arrange childcare before they went out. For someone whose mobility is limited and it's just more of an effort to get to the council chambers for a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, we've all gotten accustomed to doing things in a certain way, but we're now learning new ways and we're going to adapt to those and we're going to move forward. And I know I got an email from the League of Women Voters saying maybe this isn't the time to have a thoughtful public discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But then yesterday, our League of Women Voters of Alameda announced the exciting news that for the first time, the United States Supreme Court began livestreaming oral arguments. And I say, if the Supreme Court can do it, we can, too, although we can give you video as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other thing is that this is a time when people are paying attention. They have more time on their hands right now with shelter in place. Many people aren't working. Many people are at home. I hold the weekly mayors, COVID 19 town hall on Fridays, and I've had at Friday and on Friday at noon on a day'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with nice weather. 75 people in in the discussion, you know, listening. It's not for me it's for the pretty amazing speakers I get on this week. Speaker is the county public health officer, by the way. But so and I've also read some really encouraging news lately that young people are younger generation 18 to 30 are getting more'",
        "'speaker_0': 'politically active and interested. And a lot of it has to do with the impact on their lives that this COVID crisis has had and what they see as governments maybe from the top mishandling of this. We're also going to have a presidential election in November.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So life goes on, life goes forward. We take very seriously our duty to communicate with the public, and we're learning more ways to do it all the time. I've had probably more opportunities lately to communicate directly with my constituents in these Zoom town halls because they ask me questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not just the speaker and I, I'm. Be looking forward to to maintaining some of these new forms of communication. So as far as the items themselves, and again, I thank the subcommittee for bringing this forward, I do believe that it is worth bringing to the public the idea of allowing a future council to be compensated in a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'different manner, and also more in keeping with the the pay that other city councils are making around the Bay Area. There's nothing in Alameda that we do less of than other cities, and in fact, none of us has our own staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're doing an awful lot of the heavy lifting by ourselves. I mean, we have fabulous city staff, but we are not assigned staff people the way Oakland and some other cities are. Um, and then the, uh, the city prosecutor language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's a really important one for our residents. These are often quality of life kinds of cases that can be prosecuted by our city prosecutors, which the Alameda County DA's office just doesn't have the interest or the bandwidth to deal with, given everything else they're dealing with on a county level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's that's important for our for our city. And then as far as and clean up language, asking staff to take a look at the charter and see any clean up language that they want to identify and bring back to us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that's perfectly reasonable. I think I heard my two colleagues on the subcommittee say the formation of community task forces can wait and I would be agreeable with that. So those are my thoughts and I'm happy to hear from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear from Councilmember Vela. So I take a little bit different perspective, I guess. I think that shelter in place has actually impacted a variety of people differently than Ms.. Well, I'm so sorry. I have to interrupt you to do a quick motion because it's 1058.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Hold that thought. Um, so, counsel, we need a motion to consider two items. After 11:00, it's like 2 minutes to 11. So the next one is item six. This is the one that came back to us because council member, vice mayor in that vote had to leave and that's direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On whether or not to waiver a conflict on the retention of a particular legal firm by both the city and the Housing Authority. And the other one is, um, nine A which is my counsel referral about the, uh, the community, the tax exempt special fund to provide gap resources for local businesses, renters, local organizations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we can do, if you like. Sorry. The, um. We can make a motion to continue in here those items, but only to go to a certain time. But I would like those items heard. So do I have a motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I move?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And is it until the time when you're like, um. What do we think, council? It's ten now. 1145. It's, I mean, it's it's 1059 that 2:00. Jim. 11 now it's it's 1059 on my watch.'",
        "'speaker_2': '1145 you said, okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten 1145 think we could do this in 45 minutes? I think we can. Okay, um, do have a second to Councilmember de fax motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second. Sorry, my mike. I turned my mike off the second. Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, we have a motion. We have a second. Could I please have a voice vote?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de SAG?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vella. I'm mayor as the Ashcraft High. That carries by five days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you for that. Okay. Councilmember Vela, please excuse the interruption. Just got this text. Okay. You were saying. Yeah. So I take a little different view about the shelter in place. I think that while some people may have more time, unfortunately, because they're unemployed and now out of work and, you know, trying to figure out where'",
        "'speaker_0': 'how they're going to afford to live, I actually that worries me about considering an increase to council pay even regardless of the data and what the data shows. I also think that many of us actually have less time on our hands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am still working my day job and still teaching. In fact, I teach tomorrow morning at 9 a.m.. I am. Here at council meetings, having multiple meetings and doing a lot. And I also have zero childcare, so I'm actually doing a lot more and I think that we have a lot of working families and parents in Alameda'",
        "'speaker_0': 'who are doing a lot. And those individuals, whether they are unemployed and waiting in line at the food bank or, you know, trying to balance work and home life and child care, I think are not necessarily able to fit in and paying attention and participating or are not necessarily aware that these kinds of discussions are happening because'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they're assuming that we're working on, you know, essential or pressing matters. I do think some of the proposals like the perhaps the the clean up, the need to update our charter so that it's not. You know. Archaic in terms of the language that we have relative to access and absences.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think particularly with COVID, where even what we're hearing is that, you know, a lot of people, for instance, if of Kaiser, my mom had to go in and get tested for COVID last week. Both of my parents are seriously ill right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm also taking care of them. You know, they would have had to be hospitalized in San Leandro. And so we have residents and members of our council are Kaiser participants. You would not be hospitalized in Alameda. You'd be hospitalized.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the Kaiser facility outside of Alameda. And under our charter rules, potentially your seat would be in jeopardy. So I think that sort of language is pressing. I, I am worried about the digital divide. I think it's real.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we need to be careful about how we are letting people know that we're having these conversations, that we want meaningful participation. And yes, there are people that are online, but there are a lot of people that are not online.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And our own systems have had glitches. And we've had a meeting that literally got cut off in the middle of the meeting. Tonight, I had issues getting on to zoom. And I think that, you know, if we're going to have these charter conversations, we need to publish it well in advance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It needs to be published in the newspapers with the information about how people can download whatever platform we're using, how they can get access to it, and what phone number they can call into to access the meeting, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to be publishing it on multiple different platforms and getting the information out. Working with Meals on Wheels, working with Mastic to get the information out because some people are also afraid to go pick up their newspaper, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just think that we need to be thoughtful about how we're actually connecting with people so that they know that these conversations are occurring. Regarding Measure one, I think the Council can move forward at any time to make a recommendation to look at council pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am concerned, having seen a number of people in line at the food bank and the number of families picking up meals right now that the timing of this is just. It's just bad. It's not good timing. Well, I know that it would be for a future council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's have this conversation in the future, because how I feel about it, I agree that we're underpaid, especially somebody who literally pays to be here at times. When child care was available, I was literally paying to be a council meetings and special meetings because I had to pay for somebody to watch my child.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When we had work sessions during the day, I was taking vacation off of my day job and then paying somebody to stay with my son. So I agree. We're underpaid. I just think that the because council can bring it at any time and because it would be for a future date, I think it's a conversation that we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'should look at maybe in a year or two, hopefully, when the economy has recovered. And I think also for the, um, regarding the health care, it just seems discriminatory. I don't take health care from the city at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I way that I have health care through my day job. But it seems discriminatory to say that you're not going to provide health care for families. Um, and I have concerns about that, especially if we're underpaid. That might literally be the only benefit for people right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm a little hesitant to move forward on that change right now. For Measure two, I think we need to do a better job of clarifying the parameters of the city prosecutor relative to how we're publicizing this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's an important change that needs to happen, but I think we need to articulate it better to the general public so they understand what it what we mean by it. And they don't just think that we're going to have our own special prosecutor who's going to go out now and start prosecuting everybody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's some of the feedback that I've gotten. And so I think we just need to think about how we message that a little better to get some better engagement from people around that issue. Because I think once we have the conversation with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're supportive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of it. I just think that they don't understand it. And so we need to think about how we engage people around that. As I said, I'm supportive of changing the language around remote participation and absences. I think the language is very much outdated and needs to be updated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In terms of district elections, I think we need to wait for the census results and the census is taking place right now. I think that could really inform the conversation. And so I think having I just be concerned about having a task force now and then getting the census data later, I think we need to get the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'census data and then let that kind of inform where we go. And hopefully we get good census participation so that we get good census data. The whole other story. And then in regards to just the other topics that I know we're not going to be able to discuss, I unfortunately will not be able to participate in Thursday's'",
        "'speaker_0': 'meeting. I have childcare conflicts and my husband has an evening meeting and my kid has a hard time going to sleep when both of us aren't able to be with him to get him to go down. So I won't be able to participate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But. Thank you, Councilmember Villa, Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And maybe my suggestion to the vice mayor and Councilmember de design present in that time should not be counted against them if they wanted to have more discussion. But I, I also agree with the take on of Councilmember Bella.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we are focused on this. This is our job. You know, when we're not doing our day jobs, those of us that are lucky enough to still have them or that are not there 12 hours a day because they're a critical employee, that the public really isn't focused on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, the public is focused on their health. The public is focused on their safety. If they're a family with child or school age children, they're focused on educating their children right now. I mean, they're really not paying attention.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're wondering how they're going to get through the next day without getting sick or getting the lessons taken care of or, you know, whether their business is going to be operating so or their parents are going to get sick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I. I think it's. It's careful, too. I think we should pay close attention to what the public is focusing on. And then to Councilmember de SACS point. And I think it's the Janet Janet Gibson. I mean, we do have to be concerned about the perception.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we have two potential measures today. I mean, these were supposedly the least controversial. We have one tomorrow and then we have another one on Thursday. And I think if there's a perception whether we're not we're doing it or not, because I'm not accusing anybody of doing anything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there's a perception over jamming this through, you know, right now it's past 11. We're discussing this. There's probably nobody that's that's watching because typically we lose audience at 11. And if we do this on multiple items, especially ones as critical as we'll be talking about at the end of the week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have to be mindful of that perception. And this is where I think the perception problem arises with with at least one of these items. I totally admit we are not amending our charter either today or tomorrow or the next day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what we are doing is, like we did two weeks ago, we are narrowing the focus. So we are setting up the framework and the parameters on what type of charter amendment we are going to ask the staff to bring us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're already chopping, you know, different alternatives off so that even though we're not doing an amendment, we have to be careful about that. And even though we are not voting to raise our pay today because we can't we are voting on a potential process or we're voting on the parameters of how we might want to do'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that in the future. So the optics of this particular thing in today's time concern me, especially if we're going to ask our our public. I have a lot of faith in them to sort through, you know, all of the noise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we're going to ask them to do make a change to something that's been around for 50 years like we might do on Thursday, I think we have to be cautious of that. So, I mean, nobody's here for the money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I know I knew it was a $50 a meeting. You know, that's kind of a second thought. I don't think anyone does it for the health care. I know that personally. I used it one month when I had a transition from one job to another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that's not why we do it. We do it because we love our city. We want to make a difference. We we have people that share our values that think that, you know, we can do a great job representing them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, the optics now, we have 20% unemployment in our country. So at the time that 20% of our people don't know where their next paycheck is, we are discussing parameters on how we can increase hours. You know, we have we heard today that businesses are going to close, whether we like it or not, we're going'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to lose some some probably great Alameda business establishments. And, you know, those businesses are worrying about how they're going to pay their rent, how they're going to pay their rent, how they're to pay their employees, how you're going to pay their rent at home or their mortgage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, we're setting parameters on, you know, whether or not or how we're going to get a pay increase. And my cat is now climbing on my notebook. And, you know, we have. You know, I don't know if people know this, but, you know, right now our $50 is pensionable or posible or whatever the word is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that that we make up to describe that. And that's $50 the the benefits if they're taken or not taken or not, the allowances are not. And by bumping up our pay, um, there could be valid reasons that Councilmember de Sykes added a different time and a different place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, it's not just the $25,000, it's the purse costs. And, you know, we've already I got a warning email just today about, you know, the funding of the purse system. And that's going to be a big issue next year when we have contracts up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And for us to sit here and ask others to take a cut or to contribute more. And at the same time, we're establishing parameters and us getting more attention pay. So I think that's an optics issue to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you know, then there's the whole issue of the pension costs. And we've heard on this dais, you know, the potential budget shortfalls that we're facing. And again, the optics of us asking, putting parameters around us, making more money and not that we don't deserve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, we all do a great job, but the optics of that, at the same time, we're going to be asking our staff to come up with cuts because we are going to be in a world of hurt next year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let me just tell you, we heard from Eric a couple of weeks ago. We heard it from our treasurer. You know, we are going to have to make some serious decisions if this is not turn around. And at the same time, we're asking, you know, Eric, to cut money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're discussing the parameters of of giving ourselves more. So, I mean, I think this is just me speaking. So I'm not speaking for anybody. You know, I signed up for the $50. I think there are probably 500 more people in the city more deserving of a $25,000 raise than me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, you can start with that. Our city manager, who's been heroic, you can start with our assistant city manager, our city clerk, our city attorney. You know Mr. Potter, you know Lois Butler, all the people in economic development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if I don't mention your name, is still as a raise from our police department, from the top to the bottom. I mean, everyone who mans or staffs the EOC, I mean, all of those folks just done a heroic job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, personally, this is me speaking. I would rather be giving than $25,000 or some portion of that than taking it myself. So on the health care, you know, we just had a campaign nationally about Medicare for All and health care for all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And now many people here on this dais supported people that advocated for that. And now we're we're considering, you know, something that takes it away. And I agree with Maria. I think, you know, it hurts women because if you're on the fence between running for a council and not maybe you're a single mom and maybe you're your'",
        "'speaker_2': 'reason why you might run as you might get health care. I mean, I don't think anyone does it for that reason. But, you know, if you can't get health care, you may not run. So by just saying you can't have your family coverage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I do think it's discriminatory against families because, you know, if that's somebody's determining motive, you might just end up with a bunch of single people. And that's not representative of Alameda and the city prosecutor. You know, we've talked about this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there needs to be some more parameters around that. You know, we're having a discussion tomorrow where there is a proposal on the table that, um, a councilmember could be prosecuted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And let's not get into. I'm not just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just let me finish. And so I think that there are some parameters because I worry about that power being abused, someone who's in the minority. I mean, I think our city attorney has a great staff. He does a great job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, he's an up and comer. He may not be here. All those others that work for him are rising star. So who knows who's going to be here next. And I say that because, you know, in our last situation, we had an agenda item on closed session.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I was told by our city attorney that if the council voted to approve that litigation, she wouldn't prosecute it. So I don't say that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Critical. I say that because you can have a political conflict on that level that could manifest itself into something, something bad. So that needs to be some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clock.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Issues. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to three more points then I'll be done. On the absence of remote. I agree with Maria, you know, if you're sick or out of the city or quarantined, we had that ridiculous issue with her taking family leave where she could have lost her seat and the clean up language that's a little broader'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I mean, that's sort of what comes back, you know, gender neutral, I think needs to be taken care of. It's not she anymore. So that gender neutral has to be wider. And then if we're not discussing the task force, I won't discuss the task force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you know, Alameda progressives were not a group mentioned and then we have to be careful of unintended consequences fractionalization and you know we mentioned San Leandro Lee Thomas. Both ran citywide. He won his district, but because he ran citywide, he lost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, just all those unintended consequences. So thank you. I'm sorry I went overtime.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's okay. Um, let's see. Who haven't we heard from? I mean, Vice Mayor, you presented and Councilmember de. Thank you. I guess you did speak a bit. I do want to come back to a couple of points, but Vice Mayor, you didn't really did you have anything more you want to say or have?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I just I would just clarify a couple of things I heard. And it doesn't you know, however we move forward is how we move forward. And I, I respect my my colleagues regardless of how that is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I think it's important to point out that the items on tonight's agenda, all of them went through public hearings. In fact, I think everybody on the council here attended at least one of those hearings. They were well attended and provided information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's important not to suggest that somehow this is being done at the last minute in a rush, in the dark of night. I understand that that is the language some people are using to to stop things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They don't want to see it moving forward. But I think that that we should at least acknowledge that there were online forms and many forms that that happened. I just I just I want to clarify, because Councilmember Odie, who I respect your position, but you kept saying we are we are deserving, we're trying to give ourselves money'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and whatever else. And as proposed, we would not be doing anything for ourselves if we ran and we won. If you run for reelection and you won at the same time that this was passed, you might in the future be able to give yourself that option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think it's I just, again, for for clarity, for people watching. There is no proposal for us to give us ourselves. There is no trade off between giving people a raise this year or next year or giving ourselves more money to live on the health insurance certainly can be swayed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I can't go anywhere on that one. It doesn't sound like it's moving forward. But, you know, I think that there are cases. I also think that at a certain point in time, you know, there are costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we should think about that regard. Costs for the health care, for the amount of work that is actually put in on the council. We have people we have employees currently in the city who do not get health care, who work more hours and that than the council does and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I do think that there's it's an important balance to think about, but I think it's up for discussion. If and when we decide to move this forward, it's a matter of time and I'm okay with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. I and I'm just going to chime in on a couple of things. I, I listened to Melissa as councilmember and councilmember and I agree with what you said about the health insurance. And as far as the cost, I think we would actually need to know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oftentimes a premium for water for two is the same premium. And the employee can pay to add family members, which I think is, is actually the way it works in many cases. Um, I do think and again, thank you for the clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor. We are not voting to raise our pay. None of us will see a raise in pay and that's okay. We know what we signed up for. The reason I support it and I think it should go to the voters to decide for a future council is it does help level the playing field.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you didn't happen to have the personal financial wherewithal, say, to to run a campaign to work less hours because of the commitment that running to serve on the council takes, you didn't have, you know, some special group or whatever that would you knew you could count on for backing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would be good to know you were being fairly compensated. I mean, women for many years, we're still fighting the battle to be paid equally for the work we do compared to a man doing the same job. So I'm taken aback to somehow have it suggested that, you know, just just suck it up, that, you know, you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'shouldn't vote yourself a raise again. We're not voting ourselves a raise, but I think we do need to think about succession planning and and finding ways to level the playing field. You're right. We got a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Little. And Mayor, you saw your clock is up, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, my. Because that so let me just wrap up quickly, because what I wanted to say about as far as yeah, I don't like having a meeting at 11:00 at night either, but our next two meetings tomorrow starts at 530 and the next one starts at 6:00.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I can guarantee you we're not going to be still talking it at 11:00 at night. And this isn't the last these aren't the last conversations we're going to have on this topic. So, um, with that, I, um, I wonder where we can go from here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I think a lot of work's been put into this. Councilmember de SAC has his hand up and great. Well, time on the clock go.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. Just. I'll be quick. I'm going to recommend that we postpone a decision on this item, on the pay item, specifically until the first meeting in June. And I'm going to make that recommendation largely because I'm mostly interested in what we're going to be discussing when it comes to charter reform on Thursday night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that has to do with what will potentially be the mother of all battles to do with our historic measure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We'll cross that bridge when it comes to you. Is this a motion councilman mediator?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a that's a motion, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I see. So your motion is to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Postpone decision on the council, pay specifically to the first meeting in June. We've taken public testimony. We've had our public thing. I just think that the potential Thursday night discussion, if that is going to be on the ballot, that's going to be the mother of all battles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this will be a sideshow that that's going to that's going to be just get in the way. So that's why I'm I need to know what we're going to do with on Thursday night first. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's a motion we'll get to whether there's a second. But Councilmember Rivera has her hand up. Yes. I just wanted to say, I think at least I think we need to make a decision separate about when things go on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would hope that we can move forward certain things for points of discussion without necessarily making a determination on what goes on the ballot. I would like to have a conversation about politically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Strategy, about presenting things and in terms of a timeline for ballot consideration and at a separate meeting. And I would also just like to say that, you know, in multiple evening meetings in one week are very, very difficult for me with with a young child.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they are, I know, for other families because of that. So if we are going to have a conversation about that, to think about alternative times that we might be able to meet and have that like on a weekend or something like that, then that that's a good point and thank you for raising it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We I know when the clerk reached out, it was because these two nights had been set aside for the budget hearings. And so I guess, you know, there had been some consensus. But that's a that's a very good point that you raise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, Councilmember Vela, what you're suggesting is to also have a further discussion about the sequencing of the timeline for bringing items for the ballot. Yeah, I think we need to have a thoughtful conversation around combinations and timing and what we would want voters to consider, because there could be a number of different things on any given'",
        "'speaker_0': 'ballot. And I just want us to be thoughtful about what the overall ballot composition looks like and not giving voters too much to kind of consume in one and one on one ballot. There's a lot of different proposals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we might want to think about what gets put together on what ballot. So timing wise, would you want to have that discussion also at the first meeting in June, or do you want to see a separate special meeting?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't understand which I, I think if there's room on the at the specials at the meeting in June, I don't know what that agenda looks like. I also would want to know what we're asking folks to move forward on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like, for instance, I'm not necessarily I want to get the census information back before we talk about, you know, districts or something like that and for some of this. I just want to kind of understand. Can I make a motion that we all have more time to discuss this on the census?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want more than 24 hours in the day myself. But on the census, I keep hearing from Congresswoman Lee that they have asked for an October, an extension to October, to get the census materials in. But then when she was on my town hall last Friday, she didn't know and her age didn't know if that has'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actually been done. But I can say I think we're safe in saying we're not going to see that data in this calendar year. Right. Yeah. So I just I think just trying to narrow this conversation down so that people understand what it is we're considering and when we're considering, it would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that motion. I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think the motion is a good idea. You guys are really past your rules. And if you're going to all keep speaking, I would highly suggest going forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was for 3 minutes more each.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That we're sure. Okay. Thank you. Do we have a say? Okay. That was a motion. And second, let's have a quick roll call vote and everyone gets three more minutes to wrap this up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Daisy Knox White. Hi, Odie. Hi, Vela. Guy Mayor is Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Thank you. Thanks for being a good race person there. Um, the. Anyway, what I wanted did want to ask quickly of the city manager because I know I just looked at the agenda for the next meeting, but I don't know what early June looks like to you, Mr. Leavitt, get at that crystal ball.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, I do not know why June is right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Off the top right now. I can try to find.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That real quick if you want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, if. If possible. Um, uh. I see Vice Mayor as hands up and then back to Councilmember Vela because I was just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Going to suggest that, that given that some of the concern is about shelter in place and the first meeting in June is going to be sometime around possible changes. The second meeting in June, if we are able to go into July before actually making the final, final decision, the second meeting in June would still give us some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'months to have give some further direction and bring a final something back in July. And it would also give the community a little bit of time to start thinking, understanding what's going to happen with shelter in place. And so it might give us that six weeks instead of four weeks to come back with something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I could interject and I'm going to call on you, Councilmember Avila is I might actually ask for placeholders in both June meetings, because I think it's good to break up topics. So we're not covering too much at one time, and it also increases the likelihood that we finish earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Vela, back to you. I was going to say, if we want to have a further discussion on what items we might want to move forward on, and then a second discussion on timing, that might be the way to do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think when I talk about timing, there's a number of different elections between now and May 2023 even. And so I think figuring out when those elections are and what the timelines ahead of them are. I'm also thinking of staff time because if we're asking for that and that's going to have to put input, I think'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it might be a big ask to say, here's five charter changes. We want you to get ready for the ballot as opposed to here's one or two, let's do this, this election. There's these other elections we can consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for the second meeting in June, I think it would be helpful to understand when the regular elections, not where we would be paying for a special election, but where we have other things on the ballot. And also, if there would, if there is a need to have it, have it on a ballot, that we wouldn't necessarily'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have a council member running. But we have so many items that we're looking at moving forward. What would the cost be to do that? And we need to understand both. Yeah. So I think I'm hearing you say that to hold to to hold discussions in both meetings in June and and and we'll discuss timing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do think there is an advantage to having some more significant things happen on this November election. Just because we can assure I hope we can assure a really good turnout in the November election and that just, you know, also gets more participatory democracy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But okay, so let's we're saying we'll hear items. The first meeting in June, the second meeting in June. What are we hearing? The first meeting in June? Councilmember de SA, you proposed I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Propose that we simply postpone our decision until June. And by the way, it could be mid-June or first week of June, either way. Um, and by postponing. The decision, basically. I'm also suggesting that we not even tonight that we not even adopt in concept the possibility of an increase in council pay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That could be a discussion that we would have again in. In mid-June.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just did. So it's either going to be the first meeting in June, which is the first Tuesday or the third Tuesday. So I believe you had earlier said bring back the council. QUESTION in the first meeting in June.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I originally said that. But, you know, mid-June is fine too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, so, uh, Councilmember Vela, could we at least agree to drop certain things off of consideration like this? The. The elimination of family health care. Could that drop off? Since we're working towards narrowing. I would be okay with that because I would want to drop that off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I think the other thing that I would want to clarify for folks is on the district elections, that we would be postponing a conversation on that until after the census so that people aren't worried about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I think we just know that there's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No proposal to even move forward. Is that right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Making a proposal. I just want to there is no recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was I think I think just well, all I would say is I just really wanted my direction would be that we even wait on having a task force until after the census numbers. I think I'm understanding that both of this task forces are off the table for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So it's more going back to the items. Measures are one and two. So I would I would want to eliminate the family health care conversation from Measure one. And I think just we need to clarify a little more the parameters and perhaps that could come with the then the next staff report around the city prosecutor and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'maybe the conversation tomorrow night could.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Inform that a little more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I think yeah, I think that's a good point. Okay. When we're thinking of divvying up between the two June meetings, I think we do need to think about the items that are coming to us tomorrow and Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday, don't we? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can I. Can I propose the next. The June meeting should not now be two different meetings about different topics. I think the first meeting is which topics do we want to. Yeah. We've now had this conversation about all the topics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which do we want to move forward? Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you're saying by then we would know we've seen or seen or heard everything. Which do we want to move forward on is the first June meeting?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And the second meeting is now that we have some language from staff or whatever else, based on that they're going, we're going to have some sense of what looks like it's moving forward. Right. That right. You know, tonight, coming out of tonight, I'm not confident pay is moving forward, but it sounds like, you know, the measure'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to more of this. Right. And then and then the second meeting in June would be more about, you know, do you package it all together as one thing? Is it three items? Are there a couple we want to push off about 2023 because there is not another meeting until 2023.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Timing secret election.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Okay. So is that are you putting and you're accepting of Councilmember Val's suggestion to drop the. Yes. Okay, so can you can you put that in a motion? Cause I think you might get a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As long as yeah. As long as yeah. I guess I hear from move measure for one forward for future discussion without discussion of health benefits and measure two. And I would just recommend my, my, my colleagues who want to clarify the language around city prosecutor provide that language to provide input to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Attorney So we going to have some conversation in June, in January about that because we can't all talk about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In January and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'June. Terry I do June in January all the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry said yes when.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're here in January. No, I'm in June. Thank goodness I'm talking. Snow moved us to bring those back for further conversation in June, along with whatever moves forward on Wednesday and Thursday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And any other language clarifying language that staff identifies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I. I could actually second that if we actually if we're giving direction on Measure two, that actually there's language that comes back. Right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, yes, yes, yes. That's a clarification. Yeah, right. Okay. Thank you. Right, right, right. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With language.'",
