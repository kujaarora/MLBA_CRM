I hope all of you have had a chance to see it, so I won't waste any more of my time listing his recommendations.'",

As a council, you really don't have a lot of opportunity to affect change as much as you'd like or really as much as we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'would like. But there are things that you can do. You can do the things that the vice mayor recommended. So please do those things. His first recommendation was that we do no more repaving without complete street design and increased safety for people crossing the street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm here because I respectfully suggest that we actually expand that recommendation to include all projects, too, that define how we prioritize pedestrians relative to cars. And a big button project is a great example of that. I asked that these contracts and that the final work product are evaluated relative to your mandate that we prioritize people movement over'",
        "'speaker_6': 'car movement. I what I don't want to see is us ending up with the same type of back button configuration and signal phases that was pretty recently implemented at one of Vista and Sherman. That's a that's a real mess for pedestrian and it clearly prioritizes drivers over over people walking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if we don't review projects, including the two paving projects that are also on the agenda tonight, from a complete streets perspective, we'll end up with more projects like what Caltrans just did on the other side of the Park Street Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Park Street Bridge is the first safe estuary crossing for the west half of Alameda. For people who are walking or biking and it was just made exponentially more dangerous because no one did a design review from a Complete Streets perspective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The best way to ensure that all of these projects are reviewed through a complete street lens is to act on the vice mayor's third recommendation, which is to hire a new traffic engineer who gets safe, who gets street safety in cities.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And it's certainly. Good evening. Madam Mayor, members of the City Council. The item that has been pulled is item five H. It's for the Park Street Traffic Safety Improvements. This project is, I'll say, a bit of a legacy project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It dates back to 2011 based on the CP number. The transportation engineer who was previously working on it is no longer with the city. I'm here to kind of bring this forward to see what we can do to push this, I'll say, across the finish line and satisfy all the original grant requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I understand there are some considerations about how this signal operations are will be brought into affect once the project is complete. I personally as not being a traffic engineer, I'm not qualified directly to speak on that and would suggest that that's not an appropriate topic for tonight.'",

I had a chance to speak with public works staff before we are in one of these difficult places where the the entire staff that worked on this project and brought it to the Council for original approval is no longer here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do want to reflect that before that project was approved, the issues that Mr. Pena raised related to the pedestrian pushbuttons were agreed to not go into effect, whereby we will not have lights where auto triggering happens and pedestrian triggering doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we have that in writing that was promised by by the both the city engineer and the public works director before it was brought to council as a part of the support that bike walk Alameda did for this project originally.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So happy to bring it back to council for further discussion on that. But I just wanted to make sure that we pegged that for the public speaker that those issues were addressed before this project moved forward. And my expectation is when it goes in operations, it will go in as as agreed to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So could that be translated into direction to staff to make sure that that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I don't I mean, I don't think it needs to come personally. I would suggest it doesn't need to come back as long as the, as long as the agreement that was made. And I'm happy to send the emails that show what was agreed to basically that all modes are given equity when the light is triggered, whether'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it's triggered by signal or by signal, car actuator or pedestrian button.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Well, and perhaps just to report back to the council when that takes place would be good. Okay. And Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had a question on one quick comment. So the speaker kind of triggered something. Is it? I believe it's possible, because I think it's happened to me in San Francisco. Is it possible that you could time crosswalk signals so a pedestrian could just, like walk nonstop over a long period of time?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So instead of timing it for autos, you could time it for pedestrians. Right. It's just coincidental that in theory. Yes, in theory, yes, that is possible. The difficulty is that the distance between intersections is so great and the walking speed is so variable between one person and the next.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's really tough to say whether it's going to be 45 seconds or 52 seconds between someone who would get between intersection. So while in theory, yes, you could in practicality, you really can't do that. Okay, maybe I just walk average.'"

        "'speaker_3': 'And then the other thing, I think the issue on the Park Street, if memory serves me correct, I think that was a city of Oakland design, not a Caltrans issue. So if you want to direct your your anger at anyone, it belongs at the city of Oakland, not at Caltrans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll just observe that having spent a week in Washington, D.C. last week, I was pleasantly surprised that you generally have almost a minute to cross the streets. And so it it must be possible. So we can we can keep an eye on that.'",

I was going to hoping to take this together with five G and five K because they both happened to deal with road improvements in different parts of Alameda. But I guess we'll just take it one at a time and I'll try to tailor my questions to five J The particular question that I have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'for five j of a series of questions is what is the precise road treatment that we're looking at? Because I saw references to crack seal circles, slurry seal, as well as asphalt concrete resurfacing. But I didn't get a sense as to in what proportions are because there's only two roads that that are the subject of of item'",
        "'speaker_4': 'five j and that specific avenue between Main Street and Fourth Street and Otis Drive between Park Street and Broadway. So I wanted to know what is the treatment that that we're seeking? Because in contrast, five K was pretty specific as to the treatments I was seeking for 13 roads.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's the first question. The second question that I have is I calculated the combined feat of the two streets at roughly 2800 feet. And that's rounding. And so when you divide the the cost that we're contemplating for the 2800 square feet and it's 2800 linear feet, it comes out to be roughly $497 per linear feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the question is, how does that $497 per per foot, how does that compare, say, against benchmarks that that might be professional standard established professional standard benchmarks in terms of how much we spend for whatever kind of treatment that we're seeking or how does that compare against maybe we have local practice benchmarks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are the two type of questions that that I have about for Jay. And as we get into 4K, you'll see how it's related.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So, Mr. Wickstrom, you want to come up and ask us, see if you can give us the answers to these questions posed by council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Decide if it would please the mayor. I was actually prepared to address both items together. So if we want to bring forward five K at the same time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can address those questions as specific questions for Jane. Okay. We're still going to hear item five K separately because it's been so requested by the vice mayor. But I don't think there's any objection to talking about repair and resurfacing to different or however many different streets actually are are covered in these two items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So actually before you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Count some every day, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me just make sure to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For purposes of the public eye, make sure to ask all my questions of staff before the meeting so that they are ready to answer them. And so that this isn't one of those gotcha kind of type of questioning, because I don't think that serves the public.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there were a series of related questions that I had asked via email for AJ in case. I just want to make sure to say that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just addressing five J. I will not go through the slide. I'll kind of say that 45k And some of the questions that you asked will be captured in that second part. But specifically for Otis and Pacific, we are doing an overlay which is basically we'll be grinding out two inches, didn't do an overlay in areas where'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the pavement has failed. We'll actually do a base repair as well to that. And when it comes to treatment costs, these treatment costs are in line with what we see throughout the industry. And I'll be able to speak to that a little bit more as we as I talk a little bit on five K in a moment'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or two. Great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. That's all you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. And so council member, Vice Mayor Knox, Knoxville, I think you had some comments or questions on 5G.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll in that spirit of time to ask some questions ahead of the meeting. So I'll skip to comments on 5G specific. I appreciate the work that's being done on both of these streets. The mayor and I actually met with the neighbors of Otis between who lived between High Street and Park about ongoing concerns that they have related'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to speeding and other traffic issues. So I ask the question, if we're going to be doing a significant repaving and re striping of the of half that section of the street. Had they been consulted or was that considered as a part of this project?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Given that we're about to spend money to to work on the street, we should do what we can to address those concerns. I was concerned to learn not only did we not do any outreach to to these neighbors, but also that the neighbors had actually been asking for updates on what was happening around not this project, but'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this area and had not heard back from staff in a while. And so I would like the direction. I am happy that these are important projects that need to move forward. I'm happy to support them moving forward before four five.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'J Specifically, as it relates to Otis Drive, I would like some outreach to be done to that community to make sure that as we finalize the striping documents related to that, where we can not everything can be done with, with striping, etc., especially when you have a confined roadway where we can find some opportunities to address some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the concerns that they've raised. I think this is an opportunity that we shouldn't miss. So I'd like to. Yeah. I mean, if we're ready to make a motion, I'm happy to make a motion to approve it with the direction that that outreach happened before we finalized the striping documents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Before you make that motion, I'll just make a quick comment. Yes. The vice mayor and I did meet with these neighbors. It was shortly after the workshop that I attended for the neighbors of Otis and a different stretch of Otis from West Lyon to Grand Willow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's a much quieter stretch of Otis Drive. And so the Otis Drive neighbors more in the vicinity of Koozie Park, if you can picture that. And but we're concerned with what happened to as we were we were supposed to be next up in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I know the city engineer is now aware of their concerns. And, well, you know, we're hoping that we'll see some attempts to address their concerns in the near future. But with that, we have a motion on. So I'm on five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'J Do you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you want to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Read what the motion is that we're. Oh, I'm sorry. Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to clarify with the vice mayor's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My ask is simply that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Outreach for the neighborhoods listed within the. Resolution is well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mine was specifically as there's a group of people who have been trying to engage around this to make sure that they are engaged, that they are communicated with before the strategy is finalized. So it was specific to Otis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just trying to I'm just trying to understand. So it's this group of people is a group of people that have already reached out to the city and filed with or they're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who they sent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a group of people that sent an email to the full city council. The mayor and I responded and met with them. They are they have been engaged with public works since 2015, I believe. They are neighbors that work between I live between High Street and Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in the city manager, I believe, has the list of people that that reached out to the city at the time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Any further questions? Comments. Okay. So we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will move that recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Well, it's been moved. So would you like 2 seconds? We've got a motion. We've got a second. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, the motion passes unanimously. So then we go to 55k.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Recommendation to authorize the city manager to execute a one year agreement with M.C. K Services for repair, resurfacing of approximately three miles of street and an adoption related resolution series. And we do have speakers on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Do you want to hear the speakers who do and make your comments first?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I'd like to make my comments after hearing the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and how many speakers do we have? Okay.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'You realize that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It takes a little bit longer to drive across the street because you're scared to death. Somebody is going to go flying down and T-Bone you. And so I get a little hesitant. And part of the reason is because this issue of daylighting, I mean, I.'",

I've been riding my bike now for 61 years everywhere. And people often see me dressed as you see me now and brighter when I'm riding around town.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the brightest gear and the brightest lights on a bike. Disappear behind parked cars at when they're parked at corners. And the daylighting issue that was just raised and that John Knox White has raised previously online is a major issue in Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That made it almost impossible to see what I was driving or walking or riding my bike. And we need daylighting in intersections and the other pedestrian friendly, safe, street friendly policies that my former transportation Christian colleague and chair has raised tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm glad to see that he hasn't forgotten us. Not that I had expected. We need to have the implementation in Alameda to follow up on the policies that have been in and were adopted well over a decade ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we were a transit friendly city, pedestrian friendly city, and a bicycle friendly city. And the policies and suggestions that the vice mayor has made are the way to do that. It will cost parking spaces, but it will cost a lot fewer lives if we do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So please move forward with all due haste except for stop signs. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Speaker. And those are the public comments we have. And so then Vice Mayor Knox White, you pull this, you want to I make your comment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you very much. I appreciate it. I really I would like to start by acknowledging that our public work staff over the last 4 to 6 years has really started stepping up and utilizing our annual repaving program to institute plans that the city has put into place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That used to be that we repave roads and then we came back and re striped roads as a separate project. It's costly and it's a little ridiculous when you're already striping a road because you're repaving it. About I don't know if it was at our last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In our last meeting, we, we discussed our transportation policies for the city for the year. And I feel and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel that council spoke very, very strongly that we want to see safer streets implemented as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over the last couple of weeks, I have been engaged in conversations, mostly online, with families who have either witnessed or experienced unsafe, you know, watching kids getting hit. I mean, I believe the entire council got an email from a resident on High Street whose daughter stood and waited for 17 cars to drive by because not one would'",
        "'speaker_5': 'yield them the right of way. My response on that was, don't worry, we've got an active transportation plan that we're just about to start planning in about 18 months. We should have some ideas of what we're going to do to make our streets safe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would then add, I'm sure staff will find some ways to do some short term fixes if there's something we can come up with. So this weekend, as often happens with us, I woke up Sunday morning and said, Wait, we're about to repair a lot of streets.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the most effective things we can do very quickly and cheap cost is a red putting red curb lighting red curbs at the corner that gives somewhere between 15 and 25 feet of visibility for drivers, people who bike, people who walk, people who we heard about unicycle cycling earlier.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It allows everybody who uses the road to see each other as they come to an intersection. And it gives people a lot more time to react in the off chance that they are not fully engaged in looking for people coming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As one of the speakers mentioned, sometimes that you can't even see somebody until you get to the intersection. How are you going to have a time to stop and yield for them, let alone stop if they turn, if they decide to exercise that right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my proposal is that we approve this this contract. It's a five year contract. That's why now is is important is a one year contract with for one year for one year extension. So if we approve this contract with the expectation that on our collectors and arterials so not every single street in the city but those streets'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that are expected to carry high volumes of traffic and are usually the streets the hardest to cross safely or at least feel safe crossing that we give the direction that those intersections we would like to see. We would like to see the daylighting, we would like to see the red curb.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do in my proposal, I want to do this with full honesty and disclosure, is that there will be parking lots. But I honestly have been surprised at how many emails I have gotten about people whose kids were hit or almost hit in the last four months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's been very surprising how often this seems to happen. A lot of them, like the skateboarder on Friday night at San Jose and Broadway, was not they weren't hurt. Right. We're lucky they didn't have to go to the hospital.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we've seen in the last six months people who have died simply because somebody didn't see a senior crossing the street and hit them as they turned the corner. So I personally feel and I, you know, I think I ran on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Sorry. We're going to need to take our one hour break very quickly here, but so I'll wrap up. But anyway, I just want to I want to recommend that as we move forward with this. Again, I want to take the great work that staff has done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I want to take the commitment that our staff that our council has done, that our council has made over and over and over again and operationalize it in this in this contract and basically say, going forward, we're not going to repave our roads without taking safety is the first step.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're going to and that's going to be our initial step until we have our active transportation plan is that we're going to deal at our intersections at our highest and most used roads.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So at this point, we can take our break and come back and resume the discussion and the vote on this. Is that acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For you to finish this item before we bring with it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Okay. We're close. You think? Okay. Other comments, questions? Motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who? Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, I used to live at an intersection that now has a four way stop. And one of the first seek to fix items I filed was for daylighting, because the curb had been painted red before, it had gotten very faded.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the day that I walked outside and I noticed it was the same day that a car almost drove straight into our house up the sidewalk. And I think that, you know, when we talked about the transportation plan last time, we we mentioned the word daylighting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know I mentioned it. And I think that the majority of the council agrees on that. I would just also like to echo to folks in town if if the curve is faded in front of your house or at your intersection, please go on, see Click Fix and file it because it helps alert the city so that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we can send somebody out and actually get the curb painted in a timely fashion. And those are the types of things that save lives. These are practices that we've had in place for quite some time, as has been mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But paint fades, and so we sometimes need to come out and do that again. And I like the vice mayor's suggestion that we focus on the collectors and arterials and that we make sure that there's visibility where we have the need.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm ready to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, thank you. Again, I want to direct my questions mainly to the, the, um, road reconstruction, the nature of road reconstruction. I think daylighting is an important item, but for purposes of tonight, my questions have really more about the cost of the road reconstruction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But before we again, if perhaps the the public work staff can kind of give an overview as to the maybe three different type of general treatments that are that are done when it comes to road treatments like, um, the overlay, the slurry seal and anything else, if they can just kind of give an overlay as to what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we're talking about. And secondly, the one of the concerns that, that I came up that I have is that, um, you know, in doing the calculations as to the number of street feet, the 13 projects that are the subject of item five K, the 13 streets come close to three miles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's good. But when you divide the annual budget by the by the number of streets, I came out with a number that's roughly some like I think it was 260 roughly to $260 a linear feet. And and the nature of the project that's also what we're dealing with on five K is overlay project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At least that's what the staff report says. So it was kind of it struck me odd as to why five J is 490 and and five K is 260 pearl in your feet. So that that was one of the things I mean perhaps an explanation for that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the third question that I have has to do with I put together a map, and if you can put the I put together a map and the map identifies, you know, where in Alameda, the 13 projects that are the subject of five K are occurring and the map.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So the map, which I guess you can't see up here, but hold on. So a lot of the 13 projects are in the east end of town, although there is one on Grand and Forman all the way up there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But but a lot of them are around the east end of town. And I just wanted to know what's the rationale that went into, you know, the selection of the project. And I want to in asking that question, I also want to be clear that it's altogether possible that in 2016, we have we had a whole slew'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of West End projects. So I want to acknowledge that for that ahead of time. But I think the larger, more important point about the third question is, you know, the rationale that went into the decision as to which streets to do to to do the overlay treatments.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the first question has to do with if you can just give a broad over view on the type of road treatments. The second question is if you can kind of delve into why one road costs $490 a linear foot versus my calculation of for the five K $260 a linear foot when there are almost the same'",
        "'speaker_4': 'treatments, I believe. And then the third question is the rationale.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Mr. Wickstrom, you want to come back, please? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Oh, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Good evening, madam. Irish Catholics. I'm city engineer members of the Council. I will start as Ashley is pulling up a very brief presentation that I I'll say, pulled directly from a roughly half hour presentation that I provided to the Transportation Commission on this exact issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Really going into detail about different treatment types, selection process zones, all that kind of stuff. So I'd encourage you to take a look at that bet if you want more detail. That was March 27th of this year. Also comment on one of the speakers that mentioned us hiring a traffic engineer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm happy to report that our we are now out on the street with an open application for a traffic engineer, so I hope we do find a qualified one here shortly. So quickly, I'll touch on several of Councilmember De Selig's questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do have a database. It's the same database that most of the cities in the Bay Area use. It's called Street Saver. It's it's basically pushed forward through the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. We have maps of all of our streets.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know the square footage is we know the pavement condition index, which is either good, fair or poor or very poor. They show up in colors. They help us to kind of guide our paving broad pavement project. That's not the only thing that we look at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We also, as you know, from the consent decree for the sewer system, we're in the process of replacing most of the age sewers on the main island. And we want to be careful that we don't pay the street and come back and dig it up with the sewer a year or two later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're constantly working to kind of not step on their toes and not get ahead of them or behind them and work together in concert. We were very deliberate this year to break this city up into thirds, roughly equal square footage where we have, I'll say, the West End, west of Grand Avenue, what we call the central'",
        "'speaker_3': 'part of Grand Avenue to High Street, which is basically where this year's paving project is focused. And then Bay from Island and I'll say east of High Street a little bit over there. And those are roughly similar square footage of roadways to one to focus our contracting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's actually comes to be a cheaper cost for the contractor to perform and also allows us to work in a sewer area a couple of years out. So we in perfect world be two years behind the sewer and repaving the streets that we just dug up and replace the sewer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's how the thing had broken out that way. So it's going backwards. When we're talking specifically about costs, I will kind of summarize this graph into two different things. On the left is the PCI. On the right, there's a line there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's basically payment goes through a non-linear payment degradation. Right? It speeds up with time and the cost to repair the street goes up exponentially at the same time. The critical thing is that you really are looking to select the right treatment for the right street at the right time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's a it's a bit of a puzzle that we do every single year in terms of selecting their appropriate streets. So my map looks very similar to how some everyday songs map here in terms of, yes, we are specifically on the East End.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are going to rotate and rotate, rotate through. And these are the streets. Speaking to your question about the cost, I'll go back here just real quick. Cost for overlays. You were you were counting everything out in linear feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's more common in the practice to do it in square feet so you can normalize for the road with and stuff. So $5 a square foot for the overlay, that's fairly common, that's fairly consistent order of magnitude. It goes up a little bit, goes down a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Price of oil, how much concrete work we have to do, replacing curb, gutter, etc. It still varies from year to year, but that's not a bad number. We start talking about crack sales where you're literally painting the block snakes on the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're preventing the water from infiltrating into the into the asphalt. You're looking ten, $0.10 a square foot, roughly. It's actually paid on a per ton quantity, but it's roughly that amount and a slurry seal or Cape SEALs on that dollar per square foot range.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So those are the general order of magnitude cost. You're looking at one of the big differences between the Park Street or say, the Pacific Otis and the Phase three project is the Pacific. And Otis are overlays for both of those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the Phase 38, there's a significant amount of, I'll say, linear footage of crack steel, particularly Santa Clara Avenue, Vici and Marine as you get up there. So that that does kind of affect the appeal, if you will, the weighted cost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was one question that came by in the emails earlier also about how the money goes, and there's some asking for transferring funds. We, as a matter of course, typically do not like to specify exactly what streets we're going to pay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Even our capital budget just assigned a dollar amount to it. And then basically because again, oil prices vary, contracting and bidding climates vary. We never get we never spend all the money financed. Doesn't like us to award a contract for more money than we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we always hold back a little bit. And then at the end of the kind of fiscal year and we're done with that project, we just roll that money forward into the next paving program. So a better way to get a sense of what we're doing is to basically look at our three year paving plan that we're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'updating on a regular basis now. Speaking a little bit to Councilmember Knox White's comments and concerns. We are slowly kind of revamping how we approach the repaving project. Last year we did have a traffic consultant provide striping recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The striping that was installed on for inside is a good example of that. We were a little behind the apple there. We're a little bit further along this year than we were last year, but we're still kind of working with the traffic consultant right now to finalize those recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will definitely be including bike lanes on Grand Santa Clara, Broadway and Pacific consistent with our bike master plan and even upgrading the bike lanes proposed in Pacific to what's more than the bike master plan, because there's so much room out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then Lane was, yeah, we do look at a ten foot nominal lane or 11 foot if it's a bus or a truck route. And I do say nominal because there are some other mitigating considerations that we do sometimes get into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know tonight a lot of the discussion was about daylighting and wanting to implement in on to these projects. And there's also other considerations potentially and safety zones, other things like enhance high visibility crosswalks. There's a variety of tools that we can use in the toolbox.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But one of the considerations that that we like to or I like to think about is we're in the public works engineering part. We like to implement we like to implement policies and practices and guides guidance that we have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm happy that to go ahead and make all those implementations that we can. However, I really need to know what really is the what is in the toolbox and what are the limits in terms of what we consider to be acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that leads me to a bit of a recommendation, if I may, in terms of what may happen tonight. Councilmember NOx, I did mention the active transportation plan. We interviewed consultants both yesterday and today and are going to be close to making our decision here soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the questions asked of those consultants was, we are aware that council wants immediate action. What are some things that you can do? And so a couple of the responses was, Yeah, we can develop toolboxes of intersection improvements and guidance for implementation that that specific task does not need to wait for the full 18 months of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the active transportation plan, which will include bike lanes and other pedestrian permits, etc. So we can accelerate that component. I will like to say that while it's obviously advantageous whenever possible to do all improvements, when you're paving daylighting in particular because you're literally paving painting the curb and gutter and not putting paint on the street can be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'decoupled from the striping, can be decoupled from the paving, and can be done subsequent without a significant impact in terms of a cost impact. So it is very realistic to say that if we do have a toolbox of intersection improvements and some guidance, we can then commit to installing those improvements by the end of the fiscal year'",
        "'speaker_3': 'next year, June of 2020. And then as a matter of course, whatever we develop as part of these toolboxes, we can certainly include as a part of the 2020 paving project. So that was all I had for a little bit of presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there's any further questions, I'd be happy to entertain them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would just like to comment that that was an excellent overview and explanation of rather technical items, but very nicely done for a layperson. Thank you so much. Councilmember, did you have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I saw you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can go last.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So. Okay, Councilor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dusek. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Just a quick follow up technical question. So so I did my calculations on the linear foot because obviously I didn't know the the the area of the roads. So do you know off the top of your head how five J compares to five K or vice versa on a per square foot basis'",
        "'speaker_3': '? They're reasonably close, basically. Again, it comes to factor in other factors in terms of the amount of concrete work that we have planned to do. But both projects came with within, I'll say, 15, 10 to 15% of the engineer's estimate, which is actually fairly good in today's competitive bidding climate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In both of those we're using, I'll say for the overlay component, a base of $5 per square foot for that that component. So we were within our expectations for both projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Are we ready for a motion on this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have maybe 30 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_1': '30 seconds and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So quickly. So what direction do we need to give to how to prioritize daylighting? Because I do recall Customer Avella bringing it up in the last meeting, the vice mayor talking about it. I agreeing with with both of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what do we need to do to do that? Because there are more than just the areas that that have been mentioned today that have issues. Well, on sewer line, that is something that would most appropriately be kind of addressed as part of the capital budget discussion that we're going to be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Holding next week. Again, daylighting is something that can be completely independent of a paving program that can be done systematically throughout the city. If that's the will of the Council on Desire, I would still caution that we want to be a little bit clear about what our expectation in terms of the amount of foot that we're going'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to pull back from each curb, the potential impacts to parking, etc., and some other considerations. That's certainly something that can be addressed completely independently of a paving program as part of the capital budget. Okay. My last quick comment is, just as a matter of principle, I think a contractor at this size should not be on consent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They should come in on the regular agenda. And just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So noted. Okay, um, you know what? We're going to call a break now. It's been an hour and 20 minutes and we said we would call a break for anyone who came in a little after the beginning of the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a councilmember whose baby is due this week and we need to have a break for her every hour. And we've gone 20 minutes over that. We are taking a ten minute break and we will be back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Goodbye in your seats. We're going to resume this meeting. Good work. All right. So, if I recall correctly, I think we stopped just about in mid-sentence there. And Nancy, where were we? Councilmember de SA, did I. Did I cut you off in mid-sentence?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Pretty much. Were you finished or just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just wanted to make one quick. So, yeah, the two, two statements actually. First is I look forward to the toolbox concept and whether we give policy directions tonight regarding the the corners or not. I think that's a great conversation that we have to have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I want to thank Vice Mayor Knox White for shepherding this topic to us. So I really look forward to seeing how we can implement it via toolbox. And the second thing is, you know, as a side issue, I think this kind of to me as one council member of five, this speaks to a need for a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'street streets infrastructure commission to kind of vet these kind of detailed technical questions that we were dealing with. So one day I might raise the deal with that matter. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And advise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The councilmember to get.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To speak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He didn't I did I?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah. 3 seconds. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I promise I could give you another three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, I had all that was I needed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It. Vice Mayor Next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so I'd like to make a motion. And during the break I had a chance to speak to the city manager who rightfully raised that. What the agenda is, is a contract tonight and we are we are getting close to were not close we are starting to veer into a policy discussion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would like to make a motion that that addresses that, which is I would like to move approval of the paving contract with direction to the city manager to bring back in June a temporary toolbox that includes daylighting on our arterials and collectors that will follow our existing paving program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Up until the time we have a new toolbox that can be put into place for our future 20, 20 and other. And so the idea is that we will have a temporary tool box which lists with what the city is already doing, which was very well put out on the on the presentation will add daylighting and on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the off chance that the toolbox that was presented gets delayed. We'll know that this year and next year the temporary toolbox will be the the law of the land. And that can come back in June. I also just before I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's the end of my motion. I just want to say anybody who is interested in it's much more interesting than you think it ever could be. The Transportation Commission paving presentation, the whole thing is really, really, really interesting and it explains so many things you've wanted to know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why is the street only getting treated this way? I highly recommend it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So we have a second. We have a second. All in favor. Hi, I. Okay, that motion passed unanimously. Thanks, everyone. Great discussion. All right, so we are now still on the consent calendar, people. We're on five p slide.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'So as you know, some recent background, it's a very old center, swim center. We have a joint use agreement with the school district and the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health. I'll refer to that as the county from here on out has red tagged.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The facility will close at the end of May. I negotiated with county staff to work out a plants in that we could get general agreement to work with the school district, come back to the county with a repair plan, with a specific scope of work, and along provide them with a long term plan on how we would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'build build a city pool with some specific milestones built in so they could see we were making concrete progress. So what we've done since then is we have an ad hoc committee that's of two members of this body, two council members, as well as two school district board members, including one of their youth representatives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's staff from each agency and three members of the aquatic community. What the aquatic community has done in parallel with the ad hoc committee is they. So this ad hoc committee meets weekly every Tuesday and the community group meets every Wednesday.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that group is a wide group of representatives, from what I've heard, 20 people that meet every week from swim, water polo, diving, recreational users, masters swimmers, and so they get community input on what the needs are of the community as a whole and work through all of those issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the three liaisons bring that information back to the ad hoc committee. So it's really been, I think, a really great collaborative approach. It's been really helpful to to get information back and forth between the community and then the ad hoc committee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what the repair plan is and what you have in front of you is funding of 70%. We're estimating a maximum amount of $350,000 to do the repair plan for this is just for the immediate repairs, immediate health and safety repairs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The city would pay 70% of those costs, which is a maximum of 250,000. And the school district would pay 30% of those costs. What that would do is we is is that items before you would be addressed re plastering the dove pool dressing air leaks which helps the water turnover rate things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those were all the key items identified by the county and with the school district has already started addressing some of the smaller issues that are really kind of the low hanging fruit, such as drain covers and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did meet with the county staff two weeks ago. We're waiting on final confirmation of the approved scope of work. The reason this amount is a little bit higher, 350,000 is really just a just in case. If we if the county provides us written confirmation, which we expect next week and we stay within what we anticipate was'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the original scope of work that we had talked about with them. I expect it to be more around $250,000 at most in total. And so by authorizing the 250,000 that's really in not to exceed, I expect it to be lower than that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we would only expend obviously up to what repairs are made. Another piece of the puzzle is the division of state architecture. So any building on a school site has to be reviewed is under the purview of the California Division of State Architects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We don't believe that this requires what's called a DSA permit, but the school district, especially because there's currently with all of the construction happening at Alameda High School, there's two DSA inspectors on site every day, and we have to make sure we do it correctly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they're going to be to as soon as we get the written confirmation from the county, the school district's going to take it to DSA to confirm, here's what we're doing. We want to let you know and then make sure there's no permit required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The reason that's important is because if a DSA permit is required, it will slow this whole repair process down by 3 to 4 months. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just in case, I might have missed the explanation, but DSA stands for the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Division of State Architecture. Thank you. So in terms of the new aquatic facility and components, I want to be clear that these this is simply just initial conversations. And these are recommendations that have come from that community group that has been talking a lot about what they'd like to see in a new swimming, new swim facility.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These are the major components and we've discussed them at the ad hoc committee. Come to general consensus there as well, a 32 basically two pools, a 30 to 50 meter pool, which would be the main competition pool, a smaller 25 yard pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would be for practice. Swim lessons, recreational swim, birthday parties, things like that would have a zero depth entry because that's really for both ADA access and is great for seniors and little the little tots and such lighting for evening programing which would extend our potential for revenue and make it a more usable facility for the community'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Potentially a recreational splash play structure such as structures that have water splashing out. And that's helpful for the recreational side, again, for revenue generation, for birthday parties. And also just to attract families, we would update and modern or provide a modern fully ADA locker rooms, make sure that there's sufficient seating for bleachers and open lawn for pop'",
        "'speaker_6': 'up tents. And this is important, especially for larger meets. We've also talked about a multi-use room for training like Red Cross trainings, lifeguard trainings, things like that, a whole host of trainings for classes and also for birthday parties and also a concession snack bar and picnic table area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's also been discussed is an option to have a noncompetitive the noncompetitive pool, the 25 yard pool indoors. So maybe a mixture of indoor outdoor facility. An example of that would be the city of Albany. They have a pool that's jointly that's at the Albany High School campus and is jointly managed by the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they have an indoor pool with swim lessons and such. And they also have an outdoor competitive pool. And also that. Well, I'm going to get in a minute into kind of the next steps and how will be what some opportunities are for even further input.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another thing that the ad hoc committee looked at as potential locations in your packet. There was a list of pros and cons and that that is what the committee brainstormed. And looking at all of those ten locations as to locations that really kind of rose to the top as more ideal locations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One is the existing site at Emerald Swim Center, but we've looked at how we can push out into push out from the existing sites, such as moving the facility all the way out to Oak Street and and moving that tennis court over to another side or the fields and pushing out in different ways enough to nearly double'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the size of the facility. The other side is at Thompson Field. That obviously would require moving the existing football field first. So I want to be clear that we know where in this plan to we want to move out other sports.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we would need to make sure that there's a suitable football facility done and ready to go before we even started at Thompson Field to put a pool space in there. The up side of Thompson is a really large amount of space, so you could do nearly anything you want at that site, but again, requires relocating the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'field and being in a very tight neighborhood area would require parking and other transportation facilities on site. Damn good swimmers. The current Emma Hood Swim Center location in a bigger footprint. It's a tighter fit to get all the components that we looked at earlier.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there's existing infrastructure such as the water and the util, the sewer and all of that. It's really close to parking with the parking garage nearby and public transit. I want to be clear that neither of these sites, none of these ten sites have been vetted by the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, it's just gone through the process and we're on a pretty quick timeline. And so that's why we've been moving through the process in this way. Some additional information on how we're considering this new aquatic facility. It is being discussed as a city facility, city built and then ultimately operated and maintained by the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are really looking to make sure that it serves both competitive and recreational needs. Currently, both the sites that we've identified as having as being more ideal are on a state owned land. And so that would require some sort of land agreement between the school district and the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The mechanism of that is still being discussed and definitely has not been finalized. The school board is will be discussing that in closed session next week at their next Tuesday at their meeting. In terms of next steps for the immediate next steps to repair and reopen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, it's too for both agencies to authorize the funding. The school board is is an open session next week to authorize their portion of the funding. And we're waiting next week for the county to formally confirm the scope of work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The plan is that the pool at Emma Hood would close at the end of May because then all of the swim teams and everyone can finish their season. We would close for the summer to get all of the repairs done and then and get all all of the inspections and permits finalized and then with the goal to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'reopen for the school year. In terms of the long term plan, so the reason we're doing this long term plan is really in such a quick timeline is really to address the County Health's request that we do so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and the requirement was that we provide some sort of really high level plan so they could see we we're making progress and that so there would be milestones that they can hold us to. It's really the M.O. you that we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the first step would be that we would provide an M.O. you to the county and it's a really high level M.O. You wouldn't stipulate stipulate for example, the location, but it would stipulate that the that will be a city pool, city built, city operated and in partnership with the school district in that they will be a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'key stakeholder and that they will work with us on any land agreements. And so that's kind of the level of the the M.O. you that we would present to the county. Our current deadline is to get an MRU to them and get the timelines to them is May 31st.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've asked for an extension to June 30th and hope to hear on that next week. I want to be clear to that in terms of finalizing the location, finalizing what exactly type facility we're looking at, indoor outdoor size pools, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's time for that conversation. We don't need to get to that that to the county right away. What we need to give them is a timeline. So the current timeline has that the M.O., you would give them the M.O. you that I mentioned before, by June 30, we would have a land transfer agreement or not necessarily even'",
        "'speaker_6': 'a transfer, but some sort of land agreement between the school district and the city by December. And so by December, we would have to have a finalized location and the mechanism to do that. Then we would work on the development of the conceptual design, which would be due by by mid 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we would start to confirm funding mechanisms around that time, whether it was an infrastructure bond, private funding, some combination thereof, and then look toward timelines on permits and approvals and design and finally construction. So. So we have time to finalize the location until really, you know, sometime this fall and then finalize the mechanism by December'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and get that all into an agreement the way I have. We've also been looking at the input process on design is then in July to have potentially a joint meeting, public meeting to discuss the design ideas and location and then engage an architect to do conceptual designs such as and provide different options of conceptual designs with cost'",
        "'speaker_6': 'estimates attached. Because then we can have very real conversations about what's possible and then also work jointly with the school district to finalize a location. So that concludes my report, and I'm open to any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Are there any clarifying questions on the staff report or should we go to our have a speaker question Council member Dave.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can wait.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a quick clarifying question. In your presentation, you said you indicated as your first bullet point that the pool could be anywhere from 30 to 50 meters. It struck me as kind of odd and people here will know a lot more than me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Aren't most swimming races like, you know, divided by 50, like 25 meter, 50 meter or 100 meter? How would you do a 100 meter race in a 30 meter pool?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm actually I'm sure some swimmers can answer that better than I can, but we'll just put that question out there. But I mean, in in some part, I'm following the the desire of the community. A 30 meter pool isn't uncommon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What always boggles my mind, there's also a 25 yard pool. So there's there's different dimensions. But the 30 meter pool is standard. A 50 meter pool is considered an Olympic size is also standard. So they're both standard sizes that are that are used.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But perhaps a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Person can surely dance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So Councilman Rivera and Amy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for your presentation. My question is really trying to understand the resolution that's attached and and how it relates to the presentation. Mm hmm. So you had mentioned a high level M.O. you and benchmarks in the. And I just want to clarify, because in the resolution in the amended resolution, I think it's the seventh whereas paragraph'",
        "'speaker_6': 'requiring that by May 30th, 2019, we've now asked for an extension to June 30th. So potentially it could be May or June. Right. For that paragraph? Yeah. Since we uploaded the staff report, we're trying to get a little bit longer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Okay. And then in terms of the long term replacement plan in place, we could we could say something like high level long term replacement plan or something like that or conceptual replacement plan or something. Yeah. Okay. And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Uh, okay. And then for the July meeting, you're talking about July of this year, correct? Correct. And it'll be a joint meeting with both the school board and the council. And we would follow the. I think I think our open government policies are a little more robust than we would follow all the the posting regulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Yes. And just to clarify what that to your to your first point, what what what it could look like in terms of M0, you language would be some a high level agreement on the type of land use basically saying that the city will have full site control but not identifying the specific location.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Brody, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A few questions. Thanks for the update on this. So the district's meeting in closed session, you said next week. Correct. And I mean, at a high level, because you only have to do a high level for closed session.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, what is the what is the topic they're going to be discussing?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's on options for on land, what they can do with their land, what their options are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So like price in terms of payment, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, not more. Much more high level than that. Okay. What are the what are the what are the available mechanisms to transfer land from the school district to the city?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I guess I'm wondering if it's worth our council, you know, having that same discussion. Because, you know, we haven't weighed in on that as a full council and given any direction as the committee goes forth and discuss this with the school board.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Direction. What specifically? Because what they're really talking about is what since they own the land, what their legal options are to transfer or sell, lease, whatever the mechanism is to the city and what tools are available to them is what they're.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think it'd be good to know from a council perspective what, you know, our options are as well. And, you know, based on the different options they're looking at, you know, they have to be there has to be a finite number.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So what the impact would be for us as well. I mean, I just think that would be it'd be worthwhile for this body, at least if we're sending off a team to negotiate on the city's behalf that they have some direction and input from.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just to be clear, we're not negotiating location. We're not negotiating pricing terms or anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am vice mayor and that's why it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wasn't quite finished, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Cause I wrote them a call in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then on this M.O.. You. So overall scope of the facility location responsibilities you have land transfer in there milestones. So that's an email you that the city and the district is going to negotiate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, I mean the direction as. Who's who's negotiating that is that the subcommittees that you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The committee will be looking at it. We're starting a draft of that just kind of high level bullet points for it. The draft of it would go to each body to discuss and approve and then make tweaks and then come back and and and so so each body would be weighing in on the menu before it was'",
        "'speaker_6': 'finalized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So there's going to be an opportunity for the body as a whole to kind of give priority and negotiating authority on, you know, what we want and don't want in that milieu, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to make sure that happens.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By summer next week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, I was going to help answer the question that that was half of it right there is that we're not negotiating the ammo. I think that the conversation tonight hopefully is, you know, we're having the conversation about, you know, what are our various interests.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And the school district has some real legal requirements about, you know, required field sizes, etc.. The reason they're going into closed session is because their decision on A, do they do anything with the land? And if they do something, how does it impact their standing with the state?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were some legal issues that they had to deal with. I think our assumption and why we haven't gone in a closed session is unless there's a, in my view, to to negotiate that has legal issues. We felt that we could have the conversation starting tonight with questions like, you know, you know, do we want to do'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a long term lease? Would we prefer to own the land, etc.? We actually developed a list. The subcommittee did today I have that I can at some point in time propose it. The other thing that I and I may have looked away for 2 seconds here in the presentation, but I don't think I heard it, was that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we've also proposed holding the final two meetings of both the board and the Council in June, as so from 6 to 7 before each of our our final meetings in June as joint meetings so that if there are issues with the IMO you that need to be negotiated between both parties like literally we need to sit down'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and is out before the June 30th deadline. We will have it on our calendar to call those meetings so that all ten members can do it. But I think our assumption is, is that in the same way that we negotiate and we'll use and whatever else is that staff will do most of the work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The subcommittee, because it can meet every week and can talk to our counterparts, is trying to make sure that we're doing the bidding that we hear from from this group and whatnot. But that yeah, of course, everything will come back here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Nobody nobody is going to take something for signing and say, here, we've negotiated it at the subcommittee. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I don't know whether it's to the chair to the vice mayor or to our assistant city manager. I know. I forgot the question. So is there a contingency plan if there's request for a June 30th extension is not granted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean to have this these discussions in May.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ms. Wooldridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We certainly I mean, we're working as quickly as we can and we can certainly hold a special meeting and try and organize one for the last week of May as needed. When I met with them on site a couple of weeks ago, they seemed quite favorable towards the June 30th.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that didn't seem to be a major obstacle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, it just it might make sense to have something planned in schedule just in case worst case scenario, because the last thing I want to see happen is that we lose that extension and then all of a sudden we don't have an opportunity to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We'll know something next week. You think, from county health?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. It's been two weeks and they told me 2 to 3 weeks and I've been hounding them. So I'm hoping by next week to get written confirmation from county health.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll add that. Mr. Aldridge and the city manager Eric Levitt, and I also met with our county supervisor, Wilma Chan, to keep her in the loop on this and she's offered her assistance. So we are covering the bases.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we're coming in. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you wanna go first? Okay. I wanted to ask for clarification from you, from your perception. We have spent a lot of time talking about CITES and we've narrowed down to two and that the school district is certainly talking a little bit more about specifically a rate that the subcommittee has kind of been talking about my hood'",
        "'speaker_5': '. We're open to other ones, but it's not that we're going to send them a and start a whole new conversation about sites in July. The hope is not to because at the end of the day, one of our deadlines is going to be a signed land agreement in December.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're not going to be able to have another month and a half of conversations on where and then hopefully because that's going to hold up the design, etc.. I just you kept saying in July, we'll talk about the sites.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's true. So we're not necessarily selecting the site now, but there is also been a narrowing. And if there are concerns about that or if there are sites that people feel we're not, that this would be a great time to debate that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely. And the conceptual designs will be based on a certain site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So I certainly want all to hear all of your questions and clarifying clarifying questions and comments for Ms.. Walters. We do have a public speaker, and then we'll go into our council discussion. But if you're still in the clarifying stages, escalate.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. To that end. I guess my question is if the school board makes a determination because all I look through the list and I think half the list are are properties or, you know, city parks, that sort of thing, and half the list are school district properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If we are talking about a school district property, ultimately it's their decision whether or not they're going to. Make one of their properties available to us. So I guess my concern is, you know, can we even make a determination tonight on on a school district parcel when ultimately it's their decision to make?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think tonight's really more to brainstorm and hear if there's other ideas and if if we're not necessarily going to for confirmed only select a site tonight but it's it's a continuing it's an evolving conversation and it's a quickly moving one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think if there's other sites to be considered, we should talk about that tonight. I think if the school district ultimately decides that they're not interested in doing any kind of land agreement with the school or with the city, then we look at some of the other sites that are sitting on site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Any more clarifications?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then let's have our public speakers, so on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And Amelia Besant, it's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So my, my rule for conduct of a council meeting is I'm sure she's absolutely awesome, but we, we don't applaud, we don't cheer, we don't boo, we don't do the wave just because it keeps the council meeting moving along.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for some speakers, they actually find that intimidating and it might discourage someone from speaking. But with that, the floor is yours. And I'm sorry I didn't catch your name.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi, my name is Amelia Booth Notes. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor and Vice Mayor and City Council for hearing me. I'm lucky enough to live in Alameda, be raising two young kids in Alameda and also work in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One of the biggest problems is that I don't leave the island. Not a huge problem for me. I'm also one of the lucky people who gets to see the sunrise at my herd pool and the sunset. I coach masters and as a masters coach on the island, I can tell you that there is not nearly enough accessibility'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to the water for the city of Alameda. We have a lot of people who have come to ask to learn how to swim, but we don't really have adult learn to swim programs. We try and accommodate them, but there's not enough space.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As a mom, I can tell you that there is not nearly enough facilities available for Parks and Rec to grow their aquatics program. The wait lists are already full, like there's already waitlist for the summer, and I would love my kids to have access to the pool here as the high school some coach.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We just finished our season. We had a great season. I coach over at ends now and I can tell you that both Alameda High and ends now both have burgeoning aquatics programs and it would be, I believe, crippling to both of those programs if we had to rely on one high school pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm also a member of the Alameda Aquatics Alliance, the group that's been getting together, and it was brought up before how many people this group represents? It's a massive number. You have USA swimmers, you have master swimmers, you have club swimmers, you have club water polo.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The list goes on. I'm also going to say you have swimmers who don't realize they're swimmers yet because they haven't had access to water here in Alameda. If you build it, they will come. And this group has had access to these conversations and we're in great support of the plan as it's coming out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, and I would just really like to emphasize that it has to move quick because the where we are, there's a great wave of energy around aquatics. And if the district isn't interested in helping build the aquatics program here, I really hope that the city council continues to get behind that so that my kids grow up and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'they have access to pools. I love living here and hearing this every meeting I've gone to all of the aquatics meetings like this well in 1954, and then there's a really great statement and then in 1973, and then there's a really great statement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what I would really like to have happen is that in 2019, the really great statement as the city of Alameda got behind aquatics and didn't just leave it up to the district. And that is all I have to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So that's the no, thank you. That is the other I think under a certain age you get away with that. Okay. So now we go to our council discussion of the the issues before us. Who wants to start Councilmember de SAC?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll start acting. City Assistant City Manager Amy Wooldridge asked for council input on a range of items, one of the items being the location of the pool, recognizing that the decision is partly a decision of a USDA and also a decision of the city of Alameda City Hall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My take on on this particular thing is to give you how I would see the location decision, the lens through which I'm looking at that decision. And the lens that I would look at this decision is basically to encourage either parties, whether it's a USD or a city hall, to come up with a decision that has the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'least amount of moving parts, meaning like if you put the pool here, you have to then move this here, then you have to move that. Then there strive. I hope for the decision that is the most elegant with the least moving about parts because, you know, as Occam's razor suggests, the most elegant, parsimonious decision that oftentimes is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the best decision. So that would be my encouragement. As you have your discussions with your counterparts at a USD, let's resist any Rube Goldberg type of contraptions because and honestly, I think in the past the city of Alameda and a USD have have entered into such agreements that are very, very complicated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And given that there's possibilities that there are very elegant decision choices, that that would be my suggestion is to resist. Look. Decisions with the most moving parts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember de so Councilman Rivera.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I actually, I think that, um, we need to have a contingency plan and I think that contingency plans help move both parties along to get to where we need to be. So to that end, I want to make sure that I'm happy to hear that we're holding spots in June for those joint meetings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I actually think we should try to agenda is one of like just plan on agenda using one of them rather than just holding it so that we can have that joint meeting. And if we need to show that we have the full authority of council or or anything like that, we have it where we're building it and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we know we'll be there. I'll be there with my baby. And who's going to be a future pool kid? Because I was a poor kid. And, you know, I think the other the other thing that I think we need to do is to Councilmember Ortiz point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We may maybe need to look at a date in May just in case and get it agenda is because we have the ODC issues and I know we're doing a million things and trying to get the budget ready and everything else, but I really believe that we need to do that just in case something doesn't work out'",
        "'speaker_6': '. I also think that we need to have, just like we can pick, hey, here's our ideal a USD site. I think we need to think about what's the ideal city owned site in case a USD doesn't come through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I went through this list. I know we have other properties in mind, or we have other properties that we own as a city. There was a long conversation a while ago about the Alameda Point officer's pool. I know it's on the other side of town.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know it's not necessarily next to a U.S. but there's you know, I think it rates higher among the city owned facilities in terms of parking. Yes, we're going to need to work on transit. We're going to need to work on some other things.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think that it strengthens our position to be able to say, look, we have a backup plan in the instance that a USD isn't for some reason able to come through with one of their facilities. You know, I learned to swim in Franklin pool I swam from when I was a little kid.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I did double days during summer. I reported my times to Dr. Parker whenever I saw him in middle school. I did water polo in high school and college. And I think that being an island and peninsula community with so much water surrounding us, we really owe it to our community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm swimming now. It's the only one of the few activities I can still do, and it brings me great relief. So I really do think that we need to find a way to think about options. I appreciate the work that's gone into this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The reason I was asking the questions about the resolution is I think that just how it's worded could be a little misleading. I know I got a couple of calls from people and, you know, there are shared constituents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So whether you're, you know, a student at Alameda High School or, you know, you're you're not just under the jurisdiction of AOC, I want to make sure that they have access to pools as well. And, you know, and to that end, I also think that if there is some sort of land transfer involved, at least for me'",
        "'speaker_6': ', I want to start having a conversation of how do we make sure we preserve Alameda High's access to pools? So I don't, for instance, want them paying for pool time. I want to make sure that we we build that in so that that's part of the cost to me of of having the pool.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And if if they're willing to give us the land, yes, we're going to have to build it. But, you know, we need to make sure that our students one of the great things about interscholastic sports is that it's the great equalizer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Everybody should have access. And I think that that's an opportunity that a lot of kids get a lot of things out of being able to just go right after school into their extracurricular activities. So I look forward to the conversations that we can have with the school district on this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It would be great to partner with them on it. I think that there's a lot of potential there. I want to make sure that the facility also meets the needs of the community, and I really appreciate the community work that's gone into this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to make sure that there's an opportunity for all of our constituents to weigh in and at least hear from us. I think that there's going to be a lot of input. And and strong feelings. And I just want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that it's helpful to have both of our boards together to hear that input, because I think everybody needs to hear it. And I think asking people to go to two different meetings is very difficult, which is why I like the idea of the joint meeting so that we're all hearing the same thing and hopefully we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'can get on the same page. And whatever happened in the past with AUC, we can move forward and use this as an opportunity to build a partnership. But I'm also worried about their budget and their ability. I mean, they're having a hard time paying teachers right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't want to I don't want to nickel and dime them. And I think we're coming up on our budget talks. So I think it's kind of makes sense that we're having this conversation, even though it needs to be expedited, that we're having it in line with when we're talking about our budget and and what that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'looks like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Next, we hear.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry, Councilman Rudy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And I appreciate my colleague's comments. I mean, I agree with a lot of what both of them said. But, you know, critically, time is of the essence here. I mean, this is something we should have done literally years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think it's important knowing that time is of the essence, as Councilmember De said, not to over engineer something that, you know, may look great and, you know, with all the bells and whistles when you really need to get something done and we need to get it done fast.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think it's critical that we when we pick a site, we consider that in mind. So if you have all these moving parts, you know, there's just more more chance that something gets complicated and followed up and delayed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we've seen that. So I appreciate Councilmember De SA contributing that to the discussion and to Councilmember Vela's point. These are our shared constituents and we do have to be cognizant of the school district. And I think that to the extent, you know, we have one time money that that we've been successful in in earning as a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'city and the school district is in financial distress, that it would make sense that the city use some of that one one time money. I mean, the 7030 split is fine, but I mean, there's no reason why, you know, if it's 250,000, you know, why the city couldn't pitch in the other 75 or the other 80,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, and I don't know if it's necessary to, you know, browbeat the school board into submission, you know, because they're really not in the business of running a pool. They're in the business of educating children. So I think we should be cognizant of that as we do our negotiations with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I also think it's important that, you know, we treat them with respect as an equal partner, as they are an equal partner. And some of the details on this are really fuzzy to me still. And I'd like to have a little more clarity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, land transfers, we've done those before and those are super complicated. They have appraisals. You know, do you do we pay for the land? Do we transfer the land? You know, if we transfer land, you know, do land swap like we did with the the school district a while back, I think it was for the island'",
        "'speaker_3': 'high property. Now, that's a super complicated transaction and that's a policy decision that I think the council needs to weigh in on sooner rather than later over what types of properties we would be willing to transfer and, you know, how long of a process that is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate that having a June meeting. But I do think, as I think I asked the question and my colleague, Councilman Avella agreed with me, we should have some contingency plan that we have a meeting on calendar for May.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if any of these issues come up that we have a chance to weigh in because when I see that an IOU is going to be drafted and I don't have any input in the high level terms and bullet points and don't even really know, you know, what they're going to look like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'd like to have a chance to do that and have the community weigh in if it's something we can do in open session. So, I mean, those are kind of my general comments. You know, I reserve the rest of my time in case I want to respond to anything else that comes up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But let's not like nickel and dime the school district, especially if they do decide to transfer the land. I think we have to. If we own it, then we have a bigger responsibility. And I think that responsibility extends to what the speaker said to make sure we provide, you know, priority one would be the schools and the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'school aquatics programs because the district would be giving up land to us. So I don't want to lose sight of that either. And, you know, and I you know, I think as Councilman Abella said, you know, I think charging the school district to use land that they transfer to us just so we could build a pool, I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'think is kind of ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did you already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do? Okay. I have some questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse me. I want to make my comments now. So I am on the pool subcommittee. Vice Mayor Knox White and I are on the committee and subcommittee, and I want to compliment the members of that subcommittee and especially the Alameda Aquatics Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I got that right, because it's been really helpful to have the community input. And as I am learning all the time, we have such talented residents in Alameda and they're very generous with their time and sharing their expertize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, we even have a gentleman who's a pool designer on our on our subcommittee and on our the this joint use committee. And we have representatives of the different aquatic communities and swimmers and parents, and we also have members besides the two school board members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have the shark, the facilities manager should come and and we have the athletic director from Anthony El High and we usually have the principal from Alameda, but he wasn't there today. But anyway, we're definitely getting good input from the schools.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm a little surprised to hear that we shouldn't browbeat people. I don't see browbeating going on. Maybe it's in the eye of the beholder. We're having discussions. I mean, quite frankly, the city would love to own the land and and put in the majority of the the funding into it, if that can be worked out as far'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as charging for use there. There's a formula and right now, all daytime use during the school day up till 530 is provided to the school district and no charge. We had some discussion today about what happens on the weekends when there are tournaments and tournaments are revenue generating events.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, you know, whether there would be some charge for that because those are also when those events are going on, then the city's not collecting revenue when those pools are used for, you know, members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I, I do understand that the school district has budget challenges. So do we will we'll get into that next week. But I what I like about this committee is they are truly they we are truly working with the objective of wanting to move as quickly as possible, quickly, but carefully to get Alameda pool reopened when'",
        "'speaker_1': 'those necessary repairs are made. But then, you know, simultaneously be working on the plan for a new pool. And it's exciting to me to just to see the potential that's there, you know, not one but two poles that can be used because you need your your warm up pool and you need your competition pool.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we hope to have a splash zone for young kids and families and the zero entry pool that Mr. Aldridge described. But everyone is bringing their expertize. I mean, I don't know about scheduling swim events and tournaments and all that, but boy, are there people on the committee who can who can tell us that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But when it comes down to locations, there really are a finite number of possibilities and in kind of declining order of of suitable this suitability the the officers pool just to comment on that. It certainly has some potential as far as space.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But again, this would be the pool for Alameda High. And it's a matter of you know, it's not to say that you can't transport kids across town, but that adds another layer of of complexity. But always good to have a plan B.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that when one of the things that we are looking at when we do this community meeting in July with both of our, you know, the school board and the city council is this is a community meeting where the community will come.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Now, we're not going to start from square one because a lot of vetting has already been done and a lot of really informed decision has taken place because of these people with expertize who have informed us every step of the way.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that we are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we're all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Moving forward in good faith. We have more decisions still to make. But I do think everyone's moving in the same goal. We want there to be very little time that we are without two poles in Alameda. I mean, it will happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will have to happen because the army, the pool is is going to have to close down at the end of the school year swim season. So those repairs can be done, but hopefully we get the sign off from county health that they approve the repairs we've proposed and we get those going.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I miss Wooldridge has done a masterful job of reprograming, our city programs, summer swim programs to other, other locations, and we'll keep working at that. But I just want to just a shout out to the aquatics community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know a lot of you were in the room today and, you know, thank you again for sharing your your time and your your information with us. And I and kudos to the vice mayor because he really helped be the bridge and get the palsy aquatics community together because he's had at least one, if not two sons'",
        "'speaker_1': 'who were in aquatics at at Alameda High. So with that, would you like to make your comments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I have some comments. I guess I guess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whatever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're they're their comments. But I actually and I know some people are low on time and I'm hoping this might be an item where we actually allow people to go past the nine minute. Not myself, but I want to comment.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think there's a scenario, Amy, there, correct me if I'm wrong. Where? We may not have a commitment in May, but but there's not a scenario where we have to have an MRU by May. The June date was really chosen and suggested by us because the school district goes dark and we know that we're going to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have to have a plan and a land use agreement and everything else by the end of December at the very, very latest. And in fact, actually internally we're talking about October because we go dark in August and school district goes dark in July.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The end of June was the the last time we can do anything is as far as both bodies before September. And if we start talking about these issues and finalizing these issues in September, there's no way we get to a land use agreement in October.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we did talk about the idea of a joint meeting at the subcommittee today, and the general feeling among everybody was that unless there was a real reason to do so and folks in the room didn't see one at this time, but we're open to hearing one from this council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the council. If if there was a feeling that that that that that instead we're at a time we're kind of getting this is this is a great time to get the feedback now. Councilmember Odie, the first question on on the list that board member Harris and I agreed to bring back for for discussion was kind of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this do we have does the city care about long term lease versus exchange versus sale? At the committee level, we've been talking about supporting solutions that allow the division of state architect to get out of to not be involved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. We want to have just one regulatory agency involved in a city pool and let's not have it be the one that also oversees the schools, because it's all we will have county health no matter what. So so a question I would propose if there are feelings about is is, you know, is are any are all of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'those acceptable? Are any of those acceptable? The school district is probably going to drive a lot of that because they're the ones who own the land and they have to agree. But if we have one that we just say we're not willing to do that, now is a great time to say that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have heard that people are fairly comfortable with the city proposing and maintaining the building and maintaining the pool. I felt like the comments here said that pretty well. Well, jump to the fees issue, which I'm glad people brought up tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The other issue that we're talking about right now is how do we account for the time that AOC is given to use the pool? So currently they have a joint use agreement that outlines very specific hours that are school hours.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. The city cannot prioritize that. It cannot supplant those in the school, doesn't want to use them, but they actually are using a few more hours than that with some of their programs. And so there has been some discussion about which hours do we, you know, do we block out in our email you in our agreement thing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'specific hours for your city and which hours do we use or the current use hours? Are they the joint use hours, etc.? Do they include weekends or do we keep things really simple and keep it to weekdays? And then lastly, the fees issue is the fees for use of the pool that that I've heard at least two'",
        "'speaker_5': 'members here mentioned. You know, first off, is that the sense of the council also, you know, if there are if there are free out some hours that are not charged for is it any hours the school district wants, even if they expand their hours in the future?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it only for the hours that are in the agreement that we sign and they pay the community hour, which is again still below operating cost? So those are those are the big ones that we will know next week with the school district is interested in moving forward with Emma Hood is the site that has been the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'site that the community for members in this council two, three weeks ago said that they thought would be great if we could make it happen. And I'd be interested to know if that if it were to happen, if that would be a site you would be able to support.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then, you know, and then hopefully we will have that will become the backbone of an MRU that staff will draft and bring back to the full council. But I think those are kind of the key questions that we've agreed are kind of on the table that we're discussing for this high level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so you and I would be, you know, I think now is a is now is a great time to to provide that input, because the hope of the subcommittee is that there's not a need for a joint meeting unless for some reason our two organizations are at loggerheads and need to sit down and hash it out'",
        "'speaker_5': 'together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Vela. I say you guys are my percent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually think that those are the exact reasons why we should have a joint meeting. Um, because I think that there's nuances in every point that you raised. So, um, you know, I would want to hear from, I would want to have public comment on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would want to hear from the school board, I think, uh, agenda using each of those things that people know, those are the topics that we're going to be talking about. Um, and going over would be helpful. Um, I think that right now we're, we're working off of a proposal that Emma Hood is in fact the location'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and that the school district's okay with the transfer. In terms of the hours, you know, I think that we need to have a longer conversation about what what does future use of the pool look like? Does it if it's at Emma Hood, does the city, you know, is there separate access during the day time?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So maybe it's not during school hours that those that they get blocked off. But there is a difference in time. They do have swim meets that happen on the weekends for high school. That happens. They also have water polo tournaments that happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I wouldn't necessarily want to charge the school district for use for those sorts of things. So from my perspective I feel like we do need to agenda is a joint meeting and I think if we add those points and we can have that conversation, we might be able to get to a place of resolution fairly quickly'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Council member, Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, well if you're asking me what to what side I think is preferable. You know, having outlined what I see as the key issues, i.e. the site that has the less moving parts, frankly speaking, I think that's the good project mode site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if I was, you know, forced to make a suggestion, that would be it. But at the same time, I don't want to, you know, speak for the school district, the school district, while that will have to, you know, go through their process and in determining if their if that's a site that they want to work with'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But speaking for myself as one of five, I would suggest certainly Emma Hood, because as I said to me, that looks like the has a less moving parts on the details of fees, user hours, etc.. I have every confidence that our staff members, both at District and and City Hall staff members can figure out the details that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are fair to to each to all parties concerned, not just the institutions of the school district and city hall, but also to the users and the various organizations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Counselor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I mean, I guess push comes to shove if I. Based on the information I have now, you know, I would agree that Emma Hood is probably the best place for it. But, you know, there may be something that comes forward that changes my mind.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know. I mean, what's concerning here is more of a process issue as opposed to anything else, is that I think those are important questions the vice mayor raised. But, you know, they should be raised in a staff report with some analysis that the council could have some time to think about rather than being raised with'",
        "'speaker_3': ', you know, each person having two or 3 minutes on their clock. And we can chime in without any background or any, you know, any thought. So I think that's why I was hoping we would have a meeting. So our council as a whole could give direction on some of these important high level points.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So, um, if I, um, understand the concerns, I think that we need to hear back from the school board after they meet next week, I would say. And Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor Knox way. I mean, I would say that the the will of both of our bodies in fact the three because there really are three elements to this but the community representation and the school districts in the city, I mean, I would say that Emma Hood is the site that we're we're definitely focusing on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I mean, the chart you saw has, you know, pretty pretty much lays it out. I mean, I don't think it's a bad idea because it's to say I think it's a good idea to have a plan B that the contingency plan people mentioned so that if for some reason Emma Hood just becomes untenable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But there's there's a lot of reasons that people are moving moving towards making that work. But, you know, you never know what you don't know. So, I mean, but even so, you could look down that list of the pros and the cons and see, I don't know, what would you say the the next one would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it could be. Uh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thompson Field. But speaking of moving parts, there's a lot of moving parts on that one. And then when we get out to Alameda Point, well, it seems like it's wide open space. Some of that is spoken for, but it's also dependent on infrastructure going in and that means a delay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't do that right away. And yet you know that we've got this need for the pool sooner rather than later. So that's I mean, that has to be a significant factor. There's there's there's some factors that are in our control.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We cannot decide, you know, we want this developer now to enter this agreement and start paying for infrastructure so we can get moving. I mean, that could be a few more years. And that and the need is now and I agree with everything the coach said about we are we're underserved as an island community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't have enough water and space. And and yet I also think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Predecessor of mine, Maria Gilmore, when she was mayor, used to often say, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. You know, we could spend a long time chasing that perfect project. We will make this as perfect as we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we don't have unlimited budget, so we can't do everything in the world, but we can do quite a bit. And I understand your concerns, Councilmember Ody, about process and you'd like to, you know, have more input on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did it as subcommittees because there were just a lot of sort of preliminary things to get out of the way that didn't need to take the time of the whole council and school board. But so here we are now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the vice mayor posed some some good questions when he said that to do so. So I think one of the questions, and I don't mean to speak for you is to chime in anytime you want.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But first of all, for this body, are we comfortable with the concept of the city building and maintaining the pool? Just as an overarching theme?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I reflect on one place, my expectation is the next three council meetings will have some form of more discussion of this board in developing this. The goal is not for the subcommittee to hear comments today and then bring back a recommended M.O. you at the end, you know, two weeks before this thing is supposed to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'signed. So I just want to honored Councilmember Otis point that that there is yes. The the full entire intent is for that to happen. We're trying to get some initial feedback to give to basically we're giving it to staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll find out where the school district is next week. And then staff can work together with shark to to hopefully have the that that draft initial discussion menu that will be agenda ized fully for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can we do a quick housekeeping matter since I was on the subcommittee that did the rules on timing council comment and I'm now not speaking because I see my clock is at zero. Um, can, can we have a vote to extend our time on this matter, which I think is fairly significant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Move approval to waive the time constraints. I think we can. Yeah, just wait. Let's just we need to have this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This item only to have a second. It's been moved and seconded. All in favor. Hi. Okay, I heard. One, two, three, four. That's all I need. Do I have a four? I have five. It's unanimous. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who was speaking? Was that you?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Love it. I had my hand up. I hadn't been recognized yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've wave. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where's not waving the chair? I don't know. I mean, I understand the the need for the subcommittee because there were some urgent decisions that had to be made, especially related to the closure and the budgeting and the repair schedule.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it seems to me that a lot of those urgent decisions now are passed and we have the opportunity to have I mean, it sounds like everyone in the community has gotten to weigh to weigh in except one, two, three, because we're not allowed to go to these meetings or hear what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think, you know, I think we're at a time now where the purpose of the subcommittee to take care of the urgent issues is kind of expired. And the community as a whole, including 60% of the council, should have an opportunity to to weigh in on the these intricacies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, that's pretty much what it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Um, is that. Did you ask me?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I was just going to say, I it's also that there's three members of the school board that haven't been able to weigh in. So I think, you know, I don't I don't hear necessarily a theoretical disagreement, um, per se.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just think that, um. I guess I don't see the difference between we're going to gender is this on our council meetings and then the school district is going to agenda, is it on theirs? I think we can do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That doesn't preclude us from having, let's say, one joint meeting or something like that. And I think we could do both. So that would be my ask. And I think when we do that and what I heard from council member Odie and certainly what I would like is, you know, something, some analysis about the finances from staff'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in terms of, you know, what the what, what the components of the transfer would look like, what are concerns. And that's why I was asking the question earlier, what comes first? Right. If it's Emma Hood that we're talking about, then we need to hear from the school district first and then we can talk about what they're looking'",
        "'speaker_6': 'for, which is a staff to staff conversation. But then staff would come to us and say, this is this is basically what the school district's looking for. These are your options. So I think on that point, um, I'm not saying no to Emma Hood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm just saying I just want to make sure if for whatever reason, there's something that comes forward where somebody challenges, let's say, the use of that or the transfer from the school district to the city. Um, do we have a contingency plan?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then in terms of funding, you know, if, if we could hear from staff about laying, I mean, we still don't even know how we're going to fund the construction of it, let alone the usage of the pool, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think if we can get that information from staff, I'm fine having that agenda used at another future council meeting. And then if we can have that joint meeting with the school district where we can have the conversation, I would find that acceptable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And, and I don't disagree with that. And it'll also be up to the we can't compel the school district to have a meeting with us, but when they're ready, I'm sure that will get done. And just a quick question for the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, do we will we in our budget workshops, will we be looking at a cost for a pool?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, at.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This at this time it's not been looked at in the in the upcoming budget. You can definitely.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give direction during the budgeting sessions. But this has been going well. The temporary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the temporary cost will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be is either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this year's budget or next year's budget, but I think it's in this year's budget. But the long term cost is not being looked at and we probably would need a some type of stay because the capital is one one thing and there would have to be a bond or or fundraising or something major for for the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'capital side.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's the ongoing operations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And subsidy of the system that's going to be the more critical issue, I think, long term for the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So good good items to add to our list of discussion. But it's those are those are things details that can be worked out later. We we are on this timeline to get you know our are deadlines with county health and then to the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we're not going to wait until the December deadline. I, I still would like to see if we can have some consensus or not about whether people would be comfortable with the the concept of the city building and maintaining the pool with the understanding that we just heard from the city manager that we don't know where that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'money would come from. So but you know, conceptually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We got that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'First.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Meeting. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That's already. Okay. Well, you pose that is one of the questions I'm just going to agree with. But anyway. Okay, so we've established that. Is that was that correct. Okay. And then, oh, you said something and I was going to comment, but no, I don't remember what it was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, um, so okay, what, what more do we need to discuss tonight?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can I ask a couple questions that I proposal for how to move forward? Councilmember De Saag So I heard I heard councilmembers Odie and Vela say that they feel that the for the fees, there's just should be no charges for the schools.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I ask just a quick question? I'll get to the joint meeting. I'm not ignoring that, is there do you think for any hours they want, no matter how many hours they want, is that based on whatever? You know, if we come to a here are the guaranteed school hours every year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that what you're. Because I heard Councilmember de SAC say he's comfortable with what staff wants to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No worries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's okay. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I. I mean. Okay. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, do we have an idea of what these fees would be? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'About $21,000 a year based on what they're really current usages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's like budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dust.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It seems like, you know, if we're going to demand that the district pay that, I mean, I'd like to see analysis like what what it would be, what they're willing to do, what they're not willing to do, what they'd be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know. You know, it's like a negotiation in order for us to give direction. You know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess what we're trying to do tonight is get a sense of whether you have things you would like analyzed, negotiated for that, or should staff just go off and make their own list? I guess that's my frustration is I hear nobody's arguing that that that shouldn't exist.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now is a time that I think, okay, staff is asking for. What do you think's important for that analysis?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, is that is that something urgent that has to be done, like outside of a transparent council meeting? Or is it something that needs to be done in order to meet this deadline?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is definitely something the school district is very interested in discussing. And they they are the ones who raised it and said they would like to see where we can get for it on it. Yes, I would say yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we need it in order to do that. MRU. That's a yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Unless the school district decides they're not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I look at this and I see our reserves are like in the thirties and maybe, you know, upper thirties and those are in the thirties now that those are in the thirties. There's just like 329 million.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The district is 29 million in reserve. Yeah. Okay. Well, I thought there was a state law. They were supposed to reduce that report and. Our teachers have a one year contract. And, you know, we're sitting here talking about $21,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just seems to me kind of ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't I guess the question is understanding that you don't think they should pay the $21,000. Should they pay for nothing ever? Or is that $21,000 that they're not paying for, for the hours that, let's say, are in the current use agreement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I don't know. I think a lot depends on where the site is. I mean, if it's Emma Hood and they're going to either transfer the land to us through a swap or some type of sale, then there might be something that they might be entitled to more than if, say, we built it somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So may I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sense a resistance to like having a transparent and open process and discussing this and that? We have to discuss this today and let a subcommittee where 60% of the elected members of the two bodies aren't allowed to participate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me say, uh uh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rudy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let me say one thing. Were we to have a substantive discussion on specific items? The details that I speak of, whether they are the details of how the fees are shared or not shared, the details with regard to poor usage in time, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To me, it seems as though that discussion necessarily has to begin with some kind of staff assessment and staff recommendations, perhaps even encapsulated in a staff report. So at some point in time, it just seems like, you know, that not just because, you know, there there are hired professionals and they and they have proven themselves in in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'many projects in the past. It just seems as though for us to have a robust, substantive discussion that the public can really engage in is going to begin with staff assessment and staff information anyways. So, um, so I just, that's why I feel comfortable in, and, you know, leaving it to staff and getting their recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't necessarily have to agree with what they have to say, but I know that they're going to give their best professional judgment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Vela Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So Councilmember Desai, you had said that you don't necessarily have to agree with it. Does that mean that the expectation be that there's some sort of staff analysis and then it comes back to council and then we weigh in and then the subcommittee goes back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What's going to have to happen?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if I if I could ask intervention, which, by the way, I'm really trying to be mindful of when I go and change venues so you can be more comfortable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will ask you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You tell me. Right. Okay. Um, so I'm wondering if what we should do now is have our list of things we want staff to bring back to us at our next council meeting. Because I'm hearing that that people want some further input in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also by the next council meeting, we'll know what the school district decides next week and hopefully have time to get it into a staff report. Um, but I do think we should take a look at the resolution because that's authoring authorizing going forward with the money for the repairs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think we can all agree that we need to get those repairs done to meet the deadline set by county health.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Avella.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't have a problem with that, assuming the questions or the interpretation of the seventh paragraph is that the authorization requiring because it says by May 30th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tell me where we are now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's the seventh, whereas paragraph it says is requiring that by May 30th the city oh long term replacement plan in place, that what we mean by replacement plan is some sort of high level discussion and that by May 30th it could be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or June 30th, essentially. And that really this is this is, again, the high level stuff and that we're still going to have the staff assessment come back to council council feedback so that we can give you guys authority at the subcommittee level.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Whatever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That sounds reasonable. Ms. WOOLDRIDGE Do you have a good idea of what it is that counsel you know, from, from the discussion, what counsel wants you to come back with or do you want to run it by us?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure, absolutely so. And I just want to give kind of a I'll tell you what I'm what I'm hearing of what you want me to bring back, which is absolutely not a problem. And also just talk timing for just a second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With our Sunshine Ordinance, we have to post staff report 12 days in advance, which means for the next council meeting it's due to it posts tomorrow by five. We don't even know Thursday. Sorry. Today's Tuesday. Thank you. So Thursday at five, we don't know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's sort of I understand the frustration and part of it is because it's such a fast moving process. Right. So I can't post a staff report before I, I can, but it won't have information about what happened with the school district and what some of their what they're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So. So I just want to give that caveat that we're we're doing that. That's why not all the information is here tonight, because we're continuing to meet and things are evolving every single week. And our our sunshine ordinance doesn't allow for a quick moving process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With that, what I heard for the May 21st staff report is a financial analysis. I can provide a financial analysis on estimated construction costs, estimated land value, estimated operation and maintenance costs as well as I can give you some high level on fees.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Really in terms of fees, we just have our existing fee schedule, but there's also concessions and potential revenue for that. There's birthday parties. There's all these things that we don't even have fees for yet. So I can give you a very ballpark on potential revenue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. You also include what the current, um, usage or attach to the current usage agreement, um, the joint use agreement, joint use agreement. And I assume that outlines the hours of use and that sort of things that we can, we can have that informed conversation as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I can attach. Do you want me to charge the full joint use agreement? I'm happy to. I'll just. You could also highlight the relevant. Right. That's what I mean. I can also just abbreviate in the staff report that the if you attach it and then abbreviated in the report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. There's also a difference in the committee has been talking a lot about this about the hours that are stipulated in the joint use agreement versus the actual hours you used. So I can bring to you kind of the draft high level points for the memo you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can also bring you sort of some of the mechanisms that have been talked about. Again, not knowing what the school district is interested in doing. We don't know their legal analysis. We don't know any of that. And so it will be a very high level conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We also have looked at our in our committee a draft layout of hood. If you're interested in seeing that kind of what it could potentially how it could play out and why we think it's a site that could work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you could attach that to a staff report, the the drawing that we've got.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those are the types of data points that I have that I currently that I can provide to the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How's that sound? Good. Okay. Okay. So with that, let's take a look at the resolution. This is to authorize the repair plan not to exceed $350,000 transfers from one person to another. To do this, to have a motion to approve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been moved by Councilmember Otis, seconded by Vice Mayor Knox White. All in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. That was unanimous. All right. With that, we're going to close this item. I'm going to allow a change of venue for the city councilmember. And how are we? Are we hooking up as soon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you want to do that? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're going to take a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Five minute break.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eric.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Okay. Do we want to take a five minute break?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will take a five minute break.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Without ever able to give you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Any time. We went somewhere else in the desert.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And people ask me if I'm like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You, everyone?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So we are resuming the city council meeting and we just for the record, if you're in the room, Councilmember Vella is joining us. She's in the building, which just in a remote location that's a little more comfortable for her.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Introduction of ordinance authorizing the city manager to execute a 15 year lease with two five year options to extend substantially in the form of the attached with novelist Data Technologies, a Delaware corporation for Building 530, an 82,251 square foot building located at one 2120 West Oriented Avenue and the adjacent building 529 a 3200 square foot building and'",

At the April 2nd meeting, Nautilus provided an overview of its project, but consultants related to its proposed technology.

        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, well, I'm kind of quizzical because I know that for the most part I've been quite supportive of this project and I don't see any reason to change my mind. Since we first discussed this, at least I first discussed this in the closed door, largely because I like the impact, their contribution into the into the feet.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Potentially. Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, yeah. So it's worth continuing the discussion because I'm going to say that I'm going into this with an open mind. So we have four potential justice to continue the discussion. So to be the fifth to comment, I will say that I think by now applicants have had a chance to see the letter that the counsel received'",
        "'speaker_1': 'late last night and I forwarded to staff this morning from the Northern Alameda County chapter of the Sierra Club. And I. So I do want questions, answers to the concerns that were raised and specifically the the issue of the data center requiring constant cooling and the impact on contributing to the appearance of toxic algae blooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, and also, um, well, and with the warmer temperatures and I will note that just this week, earlier this week, you may be aware of the report that the United Nations would publish, noting the dramatic decline in biodiversity in the world, largely the result of human activity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I do think this is potentially one such activity. I will say, and I see one of the applicants is here to respond, and I'm happy to see him, because this environmental issue has been a topic that has been raised by this council in closed session the however many times we've met with you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's why I was disappointed. When in the staff report referencing the project in Stockton, all I saw were bullet points of the permits that you you received or have applied for. But as I said in my email, the staff bullet points don't provide any information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to see specifics, and I will also note that I think there is some material difference between a data center that is located on a barge in the port of Stockton versus what we're doing. But I did see that there was some communication with the author of the Sierra Club letter is Sophie Hunter, City Council Member'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in Berkeley. So with that, my biggest concerns are the environmental ones. So please, please address that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much, Madam Mayor and council members. So I want to begin just the high level on the environmental question. Our company was founded to be a solution to a very bad problem, which is the current technologies around data center.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So our objective was to design our project to dramatically contribute to the abatement of greenhouse gases, to the reduction of air pollution, and especially in California, to provide a technology solution that will be able to showcase here that will eliminate the consumption of water in data centers, which is common throughout data centers all over the world.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And there are other environmental features, too. So so the project is to produce a significant environmental benefit. That's the objective of the technology. And we went through quite rigorous review, federal, state and local regulators with respect to our first effort in Stockton.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the. Madam Chair, you quite thoughtfully asked for the actual permits. We've been happy to provide those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thoughtfully asked for them and they were voluminous and I would have appreciated having the opportunity to review them before this meeting because that's what allows me to make an informed decision.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I directed to specific actually while voluminous, the specific conclusions, especially of the state regulators, including the State Lands Commission, which involved now Governor Newsom and Alameda resident Betty Yee. I put very specifically to the page where the you know, where the determinations were made about the environmental benefits as well as the lack of any significant'",
        "'speaker_8': 'adverse impact. So if I can help you find that that would be that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It would have helped to have found it in its entirety in the actual staff report. But let's talk about the Sierra Club letter that you've had a chance to review now. So in the the second full paragraph, there is the reference to the projected volume of 10,000 gallons per minute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The heat being transferred to the bay will maintain a permanently warmer zone of water next to the Rockwall Jetty at Alameda Point. Movement of the tides will not permanent. They dissipate the relentless infusion of warmer water into the bay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And can we at least agree that that's significantly different than the condition with the barge in the port of Stockton?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, actually, we welcomed the engagement with the Sierra Club, as we have with the SEAL folks. What lies ahead of us is actually do the modeling work and the technical work to specifically go after those questions, which are quite important and in which we are 100% aligned to prevent anything like that from happening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So so I want to begin with that if something that were happen, we don't want to do the project that that is not the objective of our project. Now specifically on the on the technical aspects of it, the in the materials that you asked for, it is it was well studied and part of the secret process and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'part of the state water quality permitting as well as the State Lands Commission process to look specifically at the thermal discharge issue. The thermal discharge, the way we're engineered is the thermal discharge. Well, it's four degrees Fahrenheit difference in temperature leaving our facility when the water hits the nearby receiving water.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the area that's being discussed in the Sierra Club letter, it is highly likely. And the the work ahead of us in the permitting and the modeling will bear this out, that that water impact will be less than 1/10 of a degree Fahrenheit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it is highly unlikely that there'll be any contribution to algae formation. But the point is, with the least, we can conduct the studies and working with the Sierra Club and working with the Harbor SEAL people and anybody, any other environmental interests, I'm an environmentalist to get that technical information and have the state tell us whether there's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a problem or not. That's the advantage of the process that lies ahead of us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in the interest of fairness, I should note that this letter was received. I flew in from New York last night, and I think this came to me just before 10:00 at night Pacific time, and I glanced at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you didn't get it until today, because that's when I forwarded it to staff. So, I mean, you know, it's in the interest of fairness. You haven't had a lot of time, although again, we've been asking for things from you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the point you're making is that the list of regulatory bodies that you will come before and need to satisfy will be addressing this thermal discharge issue. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That and many, many other issues that we know we will be studying and encountering as a result of our experience up in Stockton.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So then in the second paragraph of the Sierra Club letter, they talk about how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, describes how warmer water could contribute to the growth of harmful algae. EPA Website States Toxic blue green algae prefer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Warmer water.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Water. Warmer temperatures prevent water from mixing, allowing algae to grow thicker and faster. So I think I mean, as far as my concerns, the the issue of algae, these algae blooms, toxic algae blooms are certainly not something we would want to be fostering.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not not something you would want to be fostering, not something Nautilus would want to be fostering. And, by the way, certainly not something that the state regulators would approve if that was a projected outcome. The advantage of the lease is the leases expressly conditioned on us going through these regulatory processes, getting the approvals and getting the signoff'",
        "'speaker_8': 'from the regulators that we will not have any significant adverse impacts. So that's that's our commitment. That's what we're about. And so that's why we embrace the Sierra Club letter. I immediately sent actually a letter back to Ms..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hahn outlining these very points and actually looking forward to a meeting with her and her colleagues so they can be part of the public process that lies ahead. Should the you know, should the city council decide to move forward with the conditional lease?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilmember Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So thank you. I also received a letter very late last night and actually responded to. At the club and received a response to my questions. And my questions were about this. And so Richard Banger, who is the lead on this project, responded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From what I could tell, his concern and and position was that. It would be untenable for your company to meet any needed. The state could say, go ahead. They could be wrong. What happens if they're wrong? It's going to be very difficult for you to shut have spent millions and millions, millions of dollars and then just shut'",
        "'speaker_5': 'it down because algae is detected or whatever that is. You know, I have been operating and I was going to ask Mr. McConnell if because we had had to I believe there were two things we asked for. One was clarity on which are the, you know, the state water board, which are the regulatory regulators that addressed this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'issue. And the other one was some sort of monitoring. And what happens if section I can't find the monitoring section in the exhibits. I can find the no loitering and other. So so my question would be if we were, you know, the only way that I could see us moving forward would be something where we have weekly'",
        "'speaker_5': ', you know, I don't know what the frequency is, but some kind of monitoring of the water temperature and some kind of, you know, and possibly even spelling out for the water board what it was that we wanted to make sure that they were confirming in there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So so the Sierra Club has raised very, you know, credible concerns. I would want to make sure that, A, the water board has that they are literally that is what they're approving. And in from talking to some folks there, I imagine that is what they would be confirming is that their belief that this would not lead'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to those outcomes. But then also what kind of monitoring do we have so that if it starts happening that, you know, essentially those pumps are shut down, which I know is a problem, but, you know, and is that something that could be built into this project so that there is a conversation that could continue?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if I could just piggyback on your question I'm monitoring sounds like a good idea to me. And I would want it to be independent monitoring as opposed to the monitoring from the the tenants themselves, from models. Is that what you were thinking?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I don't think I. I may not have thought it through with that. Yes, as long as we can figure out who that person is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who's paying for it. So, I mean, because my guess is it's the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the state water quality board is actually very good at this and they impose actually quite substantial monitoring requirements with respect to their permits, as do some of the other regulators. You know, for example, we have for endangered species permits up on the San Joaquin River.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's how our impacts are so low that we don't have any effect on endangered species in the river. And so we are more than happy to do monitoring and we are more than happy to bear the business risk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the risk is is ours to bear because we do not foresee this being an issue at all, because of the way we've engineered this, we are very focused on and it is complete a minimization of environmental outcomes as possible.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would note that, you know, at a 10th of a degree in the nearby water, when you move beyond the nearby water, it's you won't be able to measure the thermal load with the heat transfer we're doing is against a modest heat production by the data centers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's enough that it requires cooling, but it's not a massive amount of heat that we're actually putting out returning. The other thing you should know, because it will be likely be a mile long pipe run, there'll be a lot of exchange, heat exchanges on the way out to the water.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's highly likely the numbers will be even lower just from natural geothermal cooling that will occur. So but we're happy to model all of that. We use an independent modeling firm for this. You met one of the individuals from that firm at the last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She's she's great and her team is great. The models they use are the ones that actually the cities all rely on as well. We'll be working with Dr. Harvey on the the harbor seal question to make sure that there's the complete protection of the whales.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, again, we are so committed to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A positive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Outcome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there SEALs, unless there's been a whale spotting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. I must say, I misspoke. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So that. So monitoring. Happy to do it because it will be required of us by the by the state as part of our permits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Are there other comments from you guys? Anyone else. So, Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess I'm concerned, like, okay, we monitor what happens, we find toxic algae. Then what? I mean, some of these environmental disasters, once they happen, they're too late. Right. Like, if the SEALs somehow get disturbed and they never come back, that's too late.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're gone. I mean, that's just the way it is. So if we have algae. Toxic algae develops in a year, two years. We've gone down a path. We've tied up a building for 25 years or maybe three. If some for some reason, they have to get out of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've limited our marketing opportunities for those three years, lost opportunity cost there, and we may have an environmental thing that can't be reversed. Maybe it can. I don't know that much about it. Or somebody's sunk a lot of money into a building that now they're not going to give back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we come back in three years and we're all lamenting, why don't we just do the right thing in the first place and, you know, prioritize the environment?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think we'll ask the applicant to answer that. But as far as you're concerned, that we're locked into a lease. I imagine that we could add a clause or a condition that indicates if some environmental I mean, significant environmental impacts were determined that there would be some some recourse.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see Mr. Roush moving towards his microphone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So please.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Marin Counsel. I think that's correct. We would have to add some provisions into the lease that would basically have a, for lack of a better term, a poison pill provision such that if there were significant environmental impacts, that the applicant or the property owner or or tenant could not mitigate adequately, then it would be grounds to terminate'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the lease. Obviously, that's a huge risk that the developer tenant would have to take. But if that's the the kind of provision the council wants to see in the lease than we would we would have to draft that and and bring that back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, and that's something to consider. Something else to consider is perhaps some of these concerns will be answered by the regulatory bodies who are looking at the impact to the water and the likelihood that these conditions will lead to the toxic algae bloom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I do think that there's there's some ways you can address some of the concerns in the lease and. I you know, again, I don't think there's answers for every question, but we certainly want to address the most significant environmental ones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Rudy said, I see your hand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would just say that if this project moves forward and the project proponent goes and attempts to get approvals from the regulatory body, that the city staff also needs to be involved in that so that they clearly understand the technologies that the regulatory body might be suggesting and be able to evaluate, you know, the adequacy of those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'technologies, all the while recognizing that the regulatory bodies have a lot more competency in the area. But we've got to be a part of that, that process as well. That's us. That would be my suggestion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Councilmember Desai, if I might, we actually initially at first have to go through the secret process. And because this is a lease on city property, the city will be engaged through that whole process. Actually, the process calls for the city to be involved and then the city will also be involved in each of the permitting processes'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So so the answer to your question is it's well answered and there'll be extensive process. This is actually a relational contract. We'll be side by side on this all the way through the period where we are well assured that there's no significant impacts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if there are significant impacts, we won't go forward with the project. We won't need the city to tell us or the regulators, because the mission of our company is not to produce significant impacts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. Councilmember Vela, your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think my.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Concern is that they've all been fine in terms of getting off the ground. But if there's an issue I and we've discussed this in the past, I would want something that's concrete and laid out, will define what is significant, what we what we deem to be a significant impact.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because I'm not necessarily of the mind that that one of these regulatory board is going to have. They don't have the city's best interests at heart. They have a mission statement that I think how they define significant impact might be different, how we work our decision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think that becomes a reality for the people that have done that. From my perspective, it makes me feel a little more secure in how to take it out of the other ways. If we think that there's some risk to our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And you've heard you've heard what the acting city attorney said. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The poison pill provision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then and that's what you're thinking of as far as something concrete. To state what we deem as significant risk. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's I think the other problem. You know, the other question that I have is has to do with the location of the input and output of the water intake valve and discharge. And again, having some sort of provision, not just for me, I guess, if we're going to be probably going to get installed, but for the removal'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of that and that we actually have a bond on deposit to cover the cost of removal. So one of my questions was, what do you think the cost of installing that system is going to be? Because certainly the security deposit is $68,000 or something like that, and it could cost a significant amount of money to remove the'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Casing this time. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That for a location. And you know, will there be opportunities for input from the club or some of the other groups?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'll deal with this last point first as part of the secret process and then consistent with the other follow on processes, including the involvement of the B, C, D, C, we'll have a very intensive public process to get input as to the location of the intake and the discharge.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We offered what we think is the best solution. That's the least impactful. But we are open to other alternatives. We're not dogmatic about that. The pathways we identified were done in consultation with the city engineer. But again, if there's a if there's a different path that folks want to look at, we're happy to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That is part of the secret process. You have a proposal and then you also look at alternatives. So that's an explicit part of the secret process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What is that from the contract to the lead as we look at one of the factors, the actual construction, I think that concerns me more aspect is now. I think that, you know, other groups like the Sierra Club or some of these other environmental groups might have a difference of opinion in terms of the best location for'",
        "'speaker_11': 'in taking this charge high good faith, not not having to do with the connection to other infrastructure already in the building, but. With the overall environmental impact, my disapproval of the current calculations about water quality but that we have any idea out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yet by the way you are correct we went with that route based on the the discussions related to infrastructure. It may be there's a better environmental alternative, and certainly that's what the secret process will, in fact evaluate. On your second point, I would prefer not to call it a poison pill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't like that expression, and we'll call it an assurance of environmental protection provision. We are more than happy to have that included because as I indicated, it's not a problem for us because our objective is not to create that kind of risk.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Finally, on the removal we have, actually there is a provision in the lease now following the actually before the last meeting to ensure that we have an obligation to and have posted funding for the removal of the of the intake structure when we're done.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's included in the lease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Can you talk a little bit about what that would look like to remove that those structures because it's fairly, fairly involved? You know, we saw the drawings that were included in the packet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I suppose, Madam Mayor, it's a matter of perspective for us, actually. Wouldn't be involved at all. It's a relatively minor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Whatever it is, infrastructure project happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, the proposal is there'll be the intake box that has piles and so the structure actually sits on top of the piles. So we'll use the same process to take pull it out as we would as we as we used to put it in.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so it's just it's just civil works. It's good old fashioned maritime civil works. There's great contractors. We have representative of of the group here. Folks know how to do this. And what we're doing is relatively simple. Think of the pier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's big. That's complicated. This is a very simple thing under the pier in relative comparison. So and again, you are happy in this process over the next year to put together the plan for how that would be done and make sure that folks are comfortable with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because, again, our objective is not to have any, at the minimum, the smallest possible impact on the environment that we can achieve.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Any further questions?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No questions, but comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor, can I ask please.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Roush.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A clarifying question that I know is part of the the lease provision indicates that the lease as the project would make the council's making a finding that it's categorically exempt under secure based on existing facilities. The applicant has indicated that there is a some sort of separate secret process that the applicant will go through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the Council may want to ask the applicant to explain that secret process further so that the Council is has assurances that the city and others will have an opportunity to weigh in on that, seek that separate secret process, because this finding will make the project categorically exempt under sequel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good point. Okay. Went to the acting city attorney's point. Can you explain that separate secret process?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. As I understand it, actually, the category exempt exemption applies to the existing facility and the property. But it is our belief that our intention will be going through secure for the intake discharge component, the off it's called the offsite improvements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the lease is split between the building and offsite improvements. The buildings categorically exempt, as I understand it, but the offsite improvements will have to go through secure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And who will be the lead agency with respect to that second aspect.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is my understanding will be the city of Alameda. Thank you. And if it isn't, let's make sure it is. That would be our view.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. QUESTION All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can I just.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Say something just so on that on that point, I talked to the the director of Planning and building, Andrew Thomas, as part of this process. And he said that the entitlements that we that are on Alameda Point envisioned an industrial use in the enterprise zone, but not this this intake, the system that Mr. Cunnington was talking about'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So he is correct that that process will have to go through a secure process. And Andrew said that the city would be the lead applicant and require almost the exact same studies that they would have to provide to the state regulators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But with the cost of the secret process being borne by the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. So questions for the interim city attorney. So can you remind us, like the secret process, how it plays out, like what they have to do an application and go and. How long is that take?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Once the application comes in, there will be a determination as to whether or not the the project as as described will have a significant environmental impact on the environment. And depending on what that answer is, there could be a that would mean there could be an exemption or more likely, there would need to be a determination whether'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a mitigated negative declaration would be sufficient or whether a full blown EIA would be required, depending on what the answer to that is, is going to drive how long that process takes. Typically, a mitigated negative declaration can typically be handled in a, you know, 3 to 6 month process once it's prepared.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, from preparation to to approval, if it's an air that can take anywhere from depending on how long it takes to prepare the air and then go through the review process can take anywhere from six months to, you know, two years depending on the on the severity of the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would assume this would probably take six months to a year, just as that just kind of my sense of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then thank you and then the other agencies as the review concurrent with that process or do they have to wait to the the secret process is finished?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not quite sure how the timing on that would work. Typically, the the regulatory agencies would want to rely on a city environmental document where they would be considered. They would be part of the review process as a responsible agency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then once if the environmental document were approved, they would then rely on that and going through their review process. That's typically how. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wasn't quite sure either, but that's why I asked the question. So then if somebody opposes a secure approval, they would file a lawsuit and we would be the defendant in that lawsuit and we would we would be the one footing the bill, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. But typically, when an application comes through, part of that application process is that we would look to the applicant to provide the legal defense if there were any challenges to the project, either on environmental issues or for other reasons.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So even though we would be certainly the the defendant in the case and we would certainly keep control of the litigation, we would expect the the applicant to, number one, have its own counsel and number to be involved very closely with the city and defending that if the council had approved the project and certified the environmental documents'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So we expect mean is that that seems a little squishy to me, but I mean, is that an ironclad this is how it's going to happen or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's our normal process for when we have a project that comes forward that, you know, the applicant's going to bear that financial cost if there is a challenge to the project on either the merits or the environmental documents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the city manager wants to comment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would concur with how many cities actually put that, and I think Alameda does to put that in the agreement that it would be their obligation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the lease agreement or the secret application or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a part? Well, I don't know whether that precisely is in the lease currently, but typically as part of the conditions of approval, it is usually embedded in those documents. So we feel that there is adequate, adequate coverage to make sure that that, in fact, happens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, okay, I still have more, but thank you for the high level overview of a super complicated process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, he has every day.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, yes, you know, one word that I heard earlier this evening kind of made my ears pick up. I heard the word developer. So the question that I have is, do we know if the project proponent is going to if it goes through the approvals, local approvals, as well as regional approvals, if the project proponent is also'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a going to continue with the project itself or if they're going to sell the project to some other person once the entitlements are obtained.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The applicant is going to do the project themselves. I mean, the only thing they could do is sign the interest in the building. They can't sell it because we own it. But there this is a project that is theirs they're committed to.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And if they even had to assign it, it would have to be a similar use and we would have to approve it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And the B, I said A, so B is if they do the project, do we know if the applicant will do the project with the current corporate structure that's before us that came before us? Or will they create a separate corporate structure?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we know anything about that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I believe they're going to use the existing structure that they have now and bid the project out with contractors and project management, like similar to all of our other tenant improvement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And could that be a part of the understanding, the legal agreement, that if if if they get council approval? Well, here, let me get maybe I'm being a little opaque. You know, if someone can make agreements, do a lot of things, but maybe they and I'm not a lawyer here, but maybe they can create a limited'",
        "'speaker_4': 'liability corporation so that, you know, if something goes bad, that that's the responsibility of that separate corporate entity, not themselves. So.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, typically the the lease provision will have that that it would typically allow a lessee to assign it to some other similar corporate, you know, where the same people are basically involved. But it may not be have the same exact name as the lessee if the less lessee intends to actually to wants to assign its interest, for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'example, to a separate, you know, completely separate entity. For lack of a better description that would need to be approved by the city before that that assignment could occur.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's again I mean, again, typically, if it's sort of an internal restructuring, that's usually allowed sort of by matter of course. But if it's going to be a whole separate new company or entity or whatever you want to call it, then that's going to require an approval by the city for that assignment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. But you get what I'm kind of getting at. What I'm kind of getting at is if the worst case scenario happened and suddenly, after having sunk in all these investments, now they have to pull out the the some of the equipment that was out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's completely possible that someone might simply declare bankruptcy and say, well, you know, wait, you don't have the wherewithal to do it. And and by the way, you have to go after that that entity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's, I think, has been brought up as to make sure that there is adequate security with that that the city has access to, so that if the if the improvements need to be removed and the and the responsible party is financially unable to do it, we have a source of funds to go to to make sure'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that it can occur.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'll just interject. And I just skimmed this this lease, and I'm not pretending to be the attorney, I think. Did Miss Maxwell leave officials there? So I just want to confirm, because I'm not acting as the city attorney, but I do see that on page 20 of the lease agreement under assignment and subletting landlord consent required'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and we're the landlord that this is section 13 that landlord consent tenant shall not voluntarily or by operation of law mortgage pledge assign or transfer this lease or any interest herein to another. So that would have to come back to the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's is that address the concern that Councilmember de Sug was raising.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It does. And it generally tracks what Mr. Ash was explaining as well about sort of the assigning permitted assigning, as opposed to a unrelated assignee which would need to return.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Another question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I mean, since you brought this up, I don't I get too much in the weeds here, but just say there is a need to pull everything out. So what type of environmental review of that process of pulling anything out is going to happen?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, could they just go in there and, you know. Come in with their big equipment, pull it out, and then it's gone. Who cares about what the environmental impact of that is? I mean, there does seem to be any standards around this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maxwell, this you want to introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, I'm Lisa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Into the microphone with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lisa maxwell. I'm the assistant city attorney, real estate area councilman Odie. The restoration and surrender provisions in the lease, they expressly obligate the tenant to make those to remove their alterations at the end of the lease term. However, it wouldn't be something they'd be able to just do blindly on their own.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There'd have to be a consultation with the city and there'd have to be a coordination about the way in which those were restored. And as I mentioned to Mayor Ash, as he Ashcraft this morning, there may be a determination that it was not best to remove all of them, but instead it was better to cap some and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to cause them to be inoperable because disturbing them would cause other improvements that maybe had been laid over around them to be just to be damaged. So that would just be something that would have to be determined at the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have the right to cause it to happen. It would just be a matter of making sure that was the right decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Mayor, at this time. Housekeeping detail. It is almost 11:00, and we need a motion to consider the remaining items on this this agenda that looked relatively short. But there are some of these are time sensitive and really must come to tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's item 60 is the CDBG item. And then we have six D and six. These are Park Street and Webster Street Business Improvement Associations and then six f is our city attorney contract. We have to approve his arriving next week.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I'm looking for is a motion to go past 11. I do have a motion. Yes, I have a motion in a second. All right. All in favor. I rise upstairs. Know she's just. Okay, that's unanimous. Let's go as quickly as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually, I'm wondering whether we're ready to. To to take a vote. Any any more concerns that I see, please. By Ms.. Vela.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So and we previously talked about the threat to the about 40% of the. But 40% of the victims only stayed with the execution. Of his options which is to get a full amount applied to of the. One of my questions is what are we getting in exchange for the fact that we are considerably better than the kind'",
        "'speaker_11': 'of woman in the city of New York City?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, we have Ms.. McIntyre here to respond.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To the council directed staff to try to get some payment for the deaf. So the calculation was based on the lifetime of the life of the building. And we assumed that the building was was a 60 year life or 66 year based on the wheelchair building that was directly adjacent to it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we just did a straight percentage calculation of the first 15 years and then the additional two five years being was seven and a half each. What we're getting from from this lease for the option periods and for this term is we're getting money for infrastructure that we wouldn't ordinarily get.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in a in a ten year lease we wouldn't get, we would just get straight lease revenue. On this deal, we're getting lease revenue plus funding for infrastructure and an acknowledgment that this is a long term lease and this is almost similar to ownership.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we are getting an investment in infrastructure for the for the base, not necessarily for that area, but it's revenue that we can use base wide for infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have approved it, but not until.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': '25 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do have.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A couple to the point $3 billion in capital, $300,000. That building that nobody likes to come here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is more than $100,000 investment in the building. I mean, there they're they're going to put millions of dollars in the building. They're just not getting credit. They were not offering a shell credit for.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Much of the work that's being done in the building, back to improvements for the building and the transfer of over to the equipment that they're getting from such.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A great deal that building needs an entire new roof.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. McConnell, I wonder if we might bring Ms.. Maxwell up and the two of the two of you can?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure. I'm also the applicant if you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want to nap.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Come on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Up. I was going to clarify, was that the $100,000 was during the first 12 months of the lease term. And then there was the six plus million dollars that would be put in in the next few following years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But now that you see the building first, as I mentioned, you know, the high the high intermediate price will be the fiber because 5 million for high performance Internet fiber. Do you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want to offer a breakdown.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of where the applicant will come and give a breakdown of the the 6 million estimate?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the 100,000 is merely to fix up the place so we can all access it better and better lighting for just working in and out of the space. The main money comes after our permit approvals and almost all of it goes to the building and will be part of the what's left for the city when we depart'",
        "'speaker_8': '. You know, there may be some small things that come with us in the 6 million. We'll be putting in tens of millions of dollars of overall improvements in equipment and fiber and other infrastructure. I mean, the whole project initially will be about $100 million project and we'll be employing a lot of craft labor in doing that work'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So but the 6 million at least is what the city will inherit. You'll get a class industrial building as a result of what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so. But what are the other outside improvements?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I can't remember. Like, just one more thing before I let him answer that. What I can tell you is this when we have had other tenants interested in building 530, we require them. Some of them you heard from tonight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We require them to do extensive work on what it would take to bring the building up to occupancy standards. And that number is about $2 million because they've got to put in a completely new electrical system and it's required by app.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So just just for the building alone. So if you want to enter the offsite improvements that you're that she's asking about.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. In addition, on the building there'll be water as well and other associated infrastructure of the building. We'll also be improving the offsite. We'll be improving the exterior areas including landscaping and parking lots and other components and fencing that will go immediately offsite will be bringing two loops of backbone Internet fiber, immensely valuable because once you bring'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that fiber through and it's in two loops, which means it's redundant inside, highly reliable, and others can access it. So it will be. And that's you know, it's a huge benefit. We did that in Stockton. We ran 20 miles of brand new backbone fiber.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the community is going to be able to access it, especially the least advantaged part of the community. So that's that's a big deal. And then we will be depending on the sequencing of your other infrastructure work, we will pay if it can coincide with our work, laying our pipes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's other infrastructure that can be put on top of it. And so there'll be a net savings to the city, modest net savings the city, if it were to come in on top of what we're what we're doing and then we'll be repaving the roads and other infrastructure related the roads.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In addition, they'll be a substantial upgrade of the electrical infrastructure to that zone because Alameda will be installing and giving us also dual feed. So it'll be good back up. It'll enhance the reliability of the electrical area, not just our area, but the area around us that's fed from the two substations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those would be the core benefits that that we would see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's going to be one's first requirement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that will be some contribution to the expansion. You know. The facility is amazing, but there's only if it is divided. The problem with that is that your usage is going to be high. You think something like that might indicate that the amplifier is only if you're reading this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We expect the project to go in two phases. One is with respect, we'll take advantage of existing spare capacity from AMP, which will be beneficial to everybody. And then in the event we choose to expand further inside of the building, then there would be a follow on upgrade in the addition of new facilities and new capacity by'",
        "'speaker_8': 'AMP. But that would be, you know, that's several years down the road.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She did the right thing for developing the funding for the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as we understand, it's negotiated directly with AMP in accordance with their rules and procedures, and they've got a set schedule and methodology by which they do that work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will note the amp is governed by the Public Utilities Board in our city. Manager is a member of that board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And not him.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so we have been performing that work so that while performing that work.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Ample perform the work. They'll enter into an agreement with the applicant and perform the work. At the applicant's cost.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. The power a 1.5 to $2.5 million for you. I've been talking for.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The number in the Senate report, the 1.5 to $2 million is what AMP estimates will be the revenue generated from the project at Build. I do not know what that translates in. As for usage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do I have a representative from AMP who wants to address that? Once might not be the term.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He would have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Members of the Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do you want to introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Baba Beetham, the AGM of Administration for AMP. And then that's right. As to initially after about a year of the fall or some roll out, it's about 1.9 million in revenue for the year. You know, depending, as the gentleman said, on the full roll out, it would be about, you know, 40% of what we currently use today'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': '40% of what?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The current load of the city of Alameda. If the if there's a full roll out of the data center, you know, down the road and we're talking like five years or so down the road is our understanding that's that's the type of usage we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then 40% of the correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Roughly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if the Nautilus representative wants to comment.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So the initial ramp, so let's assume it's 18 months from now, will be about a million or more. The phase one of the plan is for ten megawatts of use. AMP has 30 megawatts of available capacity, ten megawatts of use.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That'll be about 10 million annually to AMP. So we'll grow as we go to 20 megawatts, it'll be roughly $20 million to AMP.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Rudy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there a project labor agreement on the construction work for this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was in Luis agreement?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um. Okay. Ah. So what we are looking at is, um. There is a we have an ordinance authorizing the city manager to execute a 15 year lease with two five year options to extend substantially in the form of the attach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know the contract has been being updated almost daily and for the you've read the staff report, you know, the buildings we're talking about and the location. So do I have a motion to approve this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember de. So do I have a question?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. Frankly, I am happy to move the approval of the ordinance, recognizing all the time that went into this by our city staff and also our colleagues here on the dais. I think we've all asked really probing questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I'm satisfied that that regulations are in place to address the concerns that people have raised. And I've got to believe that the regulators and the people who attend the water quality meetings or any of those are even much more vigilant than we are, as well as being expert.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I've got to believe that if they don't think that, if they think that this project puts at risk or any part of our bay, especially where the water or the water from this project meets the bay, I've got to believe that they will take the steps internally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am hearing the what staff has to say as well as our legal staff. It seems as though we're being vigilant and making sure to include controls within our lease agreement. So in terms of how this is unwinding in the past few weeks, I believe that procedures are in place, regulations, regulators are in place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in terms of moving forward, are that part of of what used to be NASA Alameda? I think this fulfills the process that we put in place to to spur economic development there. This has taken a little bit more time than I would have thought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But but I think it's been well worth it. Will there be four votes? I don't know, but I am certainly supportive of it. Much for the same reason I was supportive of it several weeks ago. But but. But I'm ready to to to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if there are four votes, that would be that would be great. And if there is not, then. And I would. Yeah, that would be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And do I have a second? Okay. So what I would want to see actually, I mean a second because then we can do discussion. So I will, I will second the motion that's been made. Um, I think that it is appropriate for us to move forward to allow Nautilus to go through the regulatory process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would want to see the lease conditioned on what was discussed earlier by the acting city attorney. If.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If, um, to add a condition to the lease that if serious environmental impacts were discovered, the project would shut down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Which might be redundant to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To the regulatory process. But I would just want that, that safeguard because this would be assuming that the approvals were obtained. And then as the project went forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Some serious environmental impact or condition was discovered. So I would want that in there. But with that, I would. I mean, so you would you would accept an amendment to the motion. Okay, so we have a motion, a second further amended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Give.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I appreciate that when I hear you say this is the and with all apologies, the poison pill, just because we all well, we all know it. We all know it. Okay. Take us to questions. Are we asking for it to come back with new language so that we are approving the new language?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are we asking are we are you is what's being proposed a approval of the lease with staff executing the following recommendations? Because those are two things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The latter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The latter. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because because I just answered your question. I think we've given sufficient direction to the city attorney. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'His his.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Assurances were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Complete, at least to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to play out in a couple. So I have a couple of other I think I think other things I heard was that I would like to see in this something that requests that the water that that as a part of the state water board analysis that we are specifically asking them if we were going to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'move this forward that we specifically asked them to include, not limit their analysis to algae blooms and long term multi year impacts of warmth to the water. Yeah. So then the next one is going to be weekly ongoing monitoring and reporting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think, you know, we are I guess what I want to what I have heard from the applicant is that they are very concerned about the environment and that is a core value of their endeavor and whatever from the council is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do not want to be the council that develops the killer algae bloom of the you know, the great killer al the algae bloom of the 2020. And so I think, you know, at least for the first five years, there needs to be some sort of weekly ongoing monitoring because we don't know what the long term you'",
        "'speaker_5': 'know, I think we can model what we think the long term impacts are, but there needs to be. The reason I ask the question of whether we're giving staff direction or not is to the Councilmember Village Point. It probably would make sense for us to be a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess. I don't know if staff feels they have the. Sense of the council in terms of what we want monitored. Exactly right. And and the reason I say that is because I'm not sure I could tell you right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it might be that we need to come in without apologies, come back with with with something. And then the last one is that we definitely talked about and it may be in here and I missed it, but it report back to the council after the state water board gives the clearance before the end.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're off. Right. So there's there's a check in here to make sure that there is agreement. So you I think those are the four conditions I've heard related to the environment, that that if something was going to go forward, I think it's probably the only way that it would be able to go forward and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. O'Connor So what I think I understand and what I might suggest is that the items that you identified are the things that you definitely want us to monitor. But I also think that we're going to learn a lot from the state water board about what their concerns would be and to be able to identify what things'",
        "'speaker_10': 'we're going to be monitoring in addition to the items that you listed. And then I think that we could also add another layer of protection for us by consulting with our environmental consultant who helps us with bass cleanup on what he might suggest that we monitor or test based on the operations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we have yet another layer that we could add on. And we have a biologist that helps us with some projects with the endangered species. And so we have we have some resources. We could put together a list of of what we would be monitoring so that you could get a pretty extensive report on on what's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'happening out there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so for me, we're monitoring with the idea that if something is found that that water is shut off, not we're going to spend another couple of months trying to figure this out. Right. We find my assumption is we're going forward with the idea that everybody is feeling very confident there will not be bad out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I'm going to call it bad algae, but algae, you know, toxic, toxic algae. Something shows up and, hey, there's toxic algae, boom, we're shutting it off. We're not going to spend another three months saying, don't worry, we're tweaking the pipes and whatever else and the toxic algae is growing and whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my my question with what you just said sounds fantastic. Is the applicant sitting there going great? Well, Senator, you know, we're ready to move forward with the least developed list in the future. And whatever you put on the list is just fine and that will be acceptable to shut.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ah, you know, like shut it, you know, throw the kill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Switch. All of that is perfectly fine with us because that's what the regulators would require us in any event and to have you include in all of that. The only thing I would note that we work together. It needs to be standards based.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. We just can't shut down because somebody thinks there's something going on. And so whatever language you're working on, I just hope we can all appreciate. Let's agree that there's a standard behind it, otherwise. Otherwise we could, you know, we're just in an unmanageable situation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely. Thank you. And Mr. McCann, I just want to comment. I, I did. I did. I, I, I really like your suggestion of consulting with both the environmental consultant we've used around me the point and also the biologist, because they may see this and come up with things that we hadn't even contemplated tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think that's good since, you know, the question was asked, could we have the Sierra Club do this? My problem with that is the Sierra Club is an organization of individuals. I think we need to have measurable standards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I understand Bccdc and the State Water Control Board, when it comes to the secret process, there's certainly the opportunity or at any time they can comment. But I, I don't I don't think I can support adding the Sierra Club as a list of entities to to check this off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I guess for me, I don't necessarily mean that they're going to rate our things. But I think as the the one organization that's written in with concerns, if they were able to speak, say, to the biologists and say here are concerns, the biologists might be able to help find some standards to make sure that we're'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not going towards those things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, certainly their correspondence can be shared. I'm assuming they raise their concerns and they're certainly can do do that. Mr. McConnell, share their correspondence.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. And I also would just like to add that I think that once I think we all have a lot of education to raise around this issue because of all of the anxiety that we feel about it. And so I believe that the communication that about standards, about monitoring and everything that we learn can come back to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the council via the city manager to city manager communication. I'm happy to just give you more than you ever want to know about inflow and outflow and what the regulators say about it so that we can kind of feel good about this as we're moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Can I ask one last.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One last question related to that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will there be an opportunity within that communication if the council says, ooh, I've got a problem with that, I guess, right? That's only meaningful if the council can say I have a problem with that, add this or change this, or we've got to stop this project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This isn't working.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Out. So okay. I think the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Fact that you guys are having to say and I want to be clear, the project applicant and the city are arguing over what what objective standards are and can't come to an agreement. There might be a point in time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's where I'm just a little worried about having this, like, yeah, just create a list and whatever is on the list. I want to make sure that the end of the day is the leaseholders who are raising the concern that we have the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ability to say, yes, that's the right list or no, that's not the right list and it's not moving forward until this thing is on the list.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would say that if we're arguing over the standard of the list, that and we have the recommendations from our biologist and our environmental consultant that there shouldn't be any argument. It should be the cities cities requirements.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But but just be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Clear, Mr. Leavitt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just to be clear. Vice Mayor Knox Why?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're just saying that you want to believe that if we're going back and forth on the standards, on the standard objective criteria, that if there's disagreement that there is ability to move that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Back to the council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh yeah. If if there's at that at that point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can definitely do that. We can make sure that's in there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. And I would envision that this is going to be a process. So you'll be getting information as we move along and and happy to get feedback and questions and and to to craft it in a way that that works for us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, this is our property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you said, Councilman Brody, you had your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I was going to just get my comments. So to me, this is a risk versus reward type of analysis. And to me, the risks still totally outweigh the rewards. So I'm not going to support it. We're talking about the environmental risks, so I'm not going to rehash those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it all the remedy seems to be trust us, we won't let that happen. And if it does, trust the agencies. Yet at the same time, you know, in one presentation today, one presentation last time, and in the letter to the Sierra Club, there's name dropping of Gavin Newsom and Betty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, I mean, I'm not saying there's any problem with the state regulators, but, you know, the name dropping is a little off putting to me as someone who worked in the state. So and then, you know, some of the regulatory agencies miss it and we still do something bad to the environment, then we'll shut down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It just seems like the risk on that is, well, one, the risk that the environmental problem happens and then too, that it's going to be extremely costly either in litigation or clean up or undoing this lease. That that to me is just not that's not an accept amount of risk I'm willing to take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So and then the other, you know, reward I hear is will we get to, you know, lease a property in in the middle of the enterprise zone? But then the risk on that is that and as staff has been telling us that, you know, long term leases or options to buy of that property are not in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'vision or not in the plan yet. This one basically, you know, by the time this lease expires, I'll be 80 years old if I'm still here. So I don't look that old now, but that's a long time. So we're basically tying up the prime property right in the middle of the enterprise zone for 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to me, the risk on that is that we're going to lose the opportunity to develop something even better there. And everyone's been saying, well, this is, you know, we don't want this type of use. We don't want that type of use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't want, you know, minimal job creators. We want maximum job creators. We want a campus. We want tech. We want something shiny, something glass. Well, we're not going to get that if we tie up this building for 25 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So then the the analysis is, well, okay, but we're going to benefit AMP. Well, and I appreciate that we had the the comments from Mr. Bang are put it in the agenda because I think he kind of debunked a lot of those those myths.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean the purpose of Alameda point and and our leasing structure shouldn't be to increase revenue for rent for AMP it should be to increase or take care of the well one create jobs and to take care of the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I guess we have the dif but you know, we're not going to see hardly any of it in the first 25 years and then we're not going to see the other of it unless there's two extensions. So when you look at it in the big picture, it's really not a lot of money we're going to see'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And then the idea that somehow this is going to create a greener, you know, amp by 2020, as Mr. Banger points out, all of AMP is going to be green, all of it's going to be renewable. So we're not going to create a better source of renewable energy on the island.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just I'm just not there. And, you know, there's the reward that the trades are going to be able to, you know, do this construction, but the trade to be able to build whatever is built out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I personally think that building needs to be torn down after going through that tour and seeing the shape of that building and seeing the position of it in the middle of the enterprise zone. You know, I don't really think we should be spending our time trying to lease that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should be trying to sell that property and develop something, you know, pardon the trite word at 11:30 p.m.. Something nice. And I don't know how a building with no walls that needs a new roof, $6 million worth of work really is going to be the catalyst to that to that side beat that enterprise zone because we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'didn't see any market case studies or market reports or analysis that says data centers. Suddenly you put a data center in and all of a sudden all this tech sprouts out around it. I mean, this is the cloud now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we don't need to have people right next to each other. So I didn't even see that it was a, you know, hypothetical was a hope. Maybe it was a business model from 15, 20 years ago, I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I'm just not here on this and I'm not going to be supporting it. And, you know, I think we can do a lot better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Ms.. Feller, did you wish to comment?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. There's a lot of things that I'm not okay with currently in the first place, so all kind of started. I think that the concept of monitoring is completely unacceptable to me. So if there were any monitoring going on, I don't think it's for the first five years.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And frankly, I think the build up over time, if it weren't, I think that the monitoring needs to continue throughout the duration of the lease, not just for a short period of time. I think that much like with other projects, the applicant should be paying for monitoring, but somebody else should be in charge of it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Um, insofar as we talked about standard and 20 to 7 standard, but I'm, you know, it may see our problem is there have been other questions raised. I think that, you know, we need to have a fair conversation about what the standards are, because I think what we're concerned about and what other entities may be concerned about'",
        "'speaker_11': ', maybe different things that are and I think biased. So I would actually want to have, you know, a community discussion about what the standards are. I think it's great that we can consult the specialists that we work with and get their input, perhaps setting up a meeting with the interested community members and groups and the people that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we already work with to see what standards might make sense for me if something I'd be interested in and support and frankly, that I would want to have for coordination here. I'm very concerned. Not one little thing. And actually three five 3529 is the climate.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So he's talking about one building, not three buildings, and we're talking about roughly 85,000 square feet in the enterprise zone. And that's creating very little jobs long term. So we've talked about this before. I'm actually not okay with the the lease option, the renewal option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't think we're getting 7.5% death rate in the workplace because we're tying the property for, you know, a quarter century.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Mr. Keller, if I if I could just make an inquiry of you because it's almost 1130 and I'm also mindful of not giving you out too late. But I think I'm hearing that you're a no vote and that Councilmember Ody is a no vote as well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if I'm laying out what I would want if I'm not saying no, I'm saying these are the things that I want. I heard everybody else kind of go through what they want and believe. These are the things that I find like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I'm in the I believe Mr. McConnell said that it would be the state water board that would do the monitoring. And the Nautilus representatives said they're happy to bear that cost. You want it to be more than five years?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's a reasonable suggestion. But but if you're saying we can't go forward until we'd had the community conversation, I don't know how we can move forward tonight unless you're saying that in some particular standard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But people are doing something. I think that there can be a compensation of what many are not. Right. And secondly, we're talking about perhaps consulting with our biologists and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our other folks. Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then you have a conversation on this as part okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As part of that community conversation. That's what you were referring to that with. Okay. Got it. It's it's it's hard not having you in the room. There's something about being able to see somebody, but. Okay. I'm understanding. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, my concern is the usage of I guess it by my name, you know, these green goals. I am concerned about the amount of consumption and pressure being put on our overall system. One of the things that we've heard is about the impacts where system operators that monitor these lines are line workers and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think it's great that AMP management is fully on board for for having this happen. But I also, if you're talking about 40% of the current load, that's substantial. And you know, I don't know that we want our staff to handle that kind of increase and to tell you about your plan for it and whether or not'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we actually have the ability to staff up to meet those needs. So I do have concerns about that and partially why that and the fact that we're talking about so much square footage in the enterprise councilmember only point I'd be fine to initially, but two options I want to support two options.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So to expand, I don't think that there's enough there for us. And just looking at development timelines and things like that, I wouldn't want to hold the property up for that long.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you wouldn't support or you wouldn't support two options to extend, but you would support one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One five year option is on the park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the 15 year lease plus five years. So 20 total.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And we're talking about I mean some of the technology, you know, the technology is constantly evolving from the start. Before not even know you 15 or 20 years, you're going to need to a program that size we're running that level you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I am seeing a thumbs up from the Nautilus representative. Was that the thumbs up to the wench? Come on up to the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So all of that is perfectly acceptable. I would just note that in terms of the consultation, that's exactly what the secret process will do. And so if we are able to move forward to the secret process, that is where all the regulatory requirements are discussed and all the requirements that aren't focused on by the regulators.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so and so for us, we need the approval of the conditional lease in order to initiate all those processes where we're in a catch 22. And so and so I really, you know, we would appreciate just the first step of getting the conversation initiated in the forms that are designed to do exactly what it is that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'everyone's been discussing. Because I would note, again, we share we are 100% aligned as to as to the end outcome of this. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Um.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I ask?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just want to clarify that what Councilmember Vela is asking and what I was talking about, as well as a community, is a city led community discussion with the consultant and biologist or whatnot, not giving the community an opportunity to write letters to a secure process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just what I heard at the diocese or at the podium and I think what was requested, I just want to make sure that there was clarity on that. Can I ask Councilmember Vella it? I've written down all the different conditions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not clear how to write a condition related to your AMP concern. It was that just a statement or was that a we have to do X in the in the lease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's it. I mean, I have a concern about that legislation that wouldn't be negotiated with the Raiders and come here. You know, one of the things that we talked about was the increase in policing that we needed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I don't I don't think we've had that conversation with AMP about how they actually plan on drafting up. You're talking about 40% of our current load. I mean, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I guess the question I'm asking is, if we're if we're talking about. You said you were. With the right conditions, ready to approve the lease. But that sounds like there's a conversation that before we could we could make that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would just I would add that. So I was in Washington, D.C. last week with Nick Operacoes and two members of the Public Utility Board for the Northern California Power Association Conference and some lobbying on the Hill. And he is very supportive of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And he and the PBE have given lots of thought to this. They this is not something that is an afterthought. And so, I mean, we certainly want to know that our other aid, other departments are, you know, well-run.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, I do think that the due diligence has been done. And we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That, yeah, we know that our system operators are currently understaffed. They're currently working on significant amount of overtime, and we're talking about ramping up. They're the ones that monitor the system. 24 seven So if a power outage or a disruption program that we do rely on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I also know that we've been having a hard time maintaining apprentices and getting them up to the journeyman position. Um. With regard to the Green Line, we're talking about adding in a significant amount of, you know, lines out there and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I want to know what the plan is, but I think the vice mayor is going to find at the end of the night considerable amount of. But what I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually I'm the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The vice mayor was asking, what did I what would my thoughts on, you know, how to try to get there? You know, I do want to get a report back from and at some point I then, you know, to say that he put a lot of thought into this, I would like to know what the actual rollout'",
        "'speaker_11': 'plan is, how we plan on standing up for a 40% increase.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm I'm sorry. I'm sorry we weren't able to address that question when we were in closed session with Mr. Perot, cos he's not here tonight. But if that's a question that your vote hinges on, then I'm afraid we can't answer you tonight if it's something you want consultation with as part of this community conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I heard her say that she wanted a request. She went to request a report back from Apple on how they're going to handle it, but not necessarily contingent on moving forward with this. Is that correct? Councilmember Bell?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. Sorry. Sorry. I must have missed that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. And then the other thing, the second option I'm not supportive of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the second option?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Only do one five year option, not two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we already got. We got agreement on that. Okay. Are we ready to take a vote? Because we've got three more items to cover. But I think we've also covered this extensively. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I ask one last question?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can. And I think we may actually have a. Okay. Before you ask questions, let's hear from the the legal team here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the question and it was raised and I'm not sure that we got a clear answer if the council moves ahead with approving tonight is staff directed to include in the lease the comments which have been made and then we will just go forward based on that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or does the council want to see that language before the sort of final vote on the lease is taken? I think we need that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I and I thought that I heard Mr. Makana read back to us, which she understood, and that that was sufficient to you. Is that your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Understanding?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I think that's a part of the question is, is the motion to give. What I heard was the motion was to give direction to address these and that it didn't need to come back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, that's what I heard, too, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, but now. Well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jody.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Question. I mean, is it going to come back in second reading on modified or come back modified? And I still get to ask questions, even though I'm not going to support it. I mean, I know what you were going to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You do so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think, you know, I have still 2 minutes left.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's it is an ordinance which needs a second read. And what what I'm I guess what what I'm asking is if there's if there's four votes to sort of move ahead with this, I think the the better course of action would then would be to bring the ordinance back with these revisions for the first reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The first reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I mean, I think we need to do whatever is most legally correct. But but it will be it will come back and it will be. I mean, does it open it up to something? Is it going to be on consent?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It will be it will be a regular agenda item, because we will need to have the council introduce the ordinance. So there will be a chance for the people to speak about the lease again, just like we did a couple or three weeks ago now or something.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that will give the council the opportunity then to see what language has been drafted. Okay. My concern is that given the time frame, we may not get this back to you on the 21st. But that's I mean, that's yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's just the turnaround time. Right. And plus, your May 21st agenda has rent control on it, which may take some time. Yeah. So we, you know, we're just sort of how we will bring this back as quickly as we can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But obviously, there has to be some drafting. Certainly the applicant is going to want to have some input in terms of what the language says, but we will get it back to you as quickly as we can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, and I think for a number of reason that that works out, because then you'll also have an opportunity to address some of the questions that have been raised tonight in this draft.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And try to translate what's in the leaked document itself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your next. Just a minute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As we put that plan in action, I just want to point out, we have somebody on the phone right now who is going to this requires four votes. Yeah. We currently if I were to read the votes have four votes plus Mr. Odey.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's about to go over.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of the four votes is about to leave. So I just want to write to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This could become a. Am I putting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I got it. And so can I, if I could just ask. So hearing that as a good reminder, is there any way you could see the structure that so that this is a first reading? I mean, I don't I well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And there's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The if I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Misspell it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I didn't plan on not being up at the meeting and what I mean and one final the really going into labor and you plan on calling the upcoming meeting. So I, I want to make that clear. I'm fine with this coming back after first reading, I, I think that some of we've given them a lot to put'",
        "'speaker_11': 'into at least.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think it's that we certainly rather than draft or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That we're talking about a 78 pages so I'm a little hesitant to find a draft or find a way to make it fit within the first reading. And I think that gives us the opportunity also to have Nico come back and be present to collect a little bit on the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I don't know Mr. Bercow's schedule, but I will say, and by the way, the 78 pages of the list are not all necessary to. I've gone through that. A lot of that is boilerplate language that's in every release.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I you know, it's probably a stretch to make this a first reading with staff direction. I can just read your face, Mr. Roush.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would not. I would not recommend it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I got you. I Mr. Levitt, did you want to comment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, I would agree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay, Attorney.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a person in the second. All right. Okay. So in that case, we have, um. Do we need a further motion at this time?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's. Well, I think we would like to. I think from staff's point of view that, I mean, maybe there is a consensus there's for the time. And if that's the case, then we will proceed accordingly without necessarily a vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If that's if that's a fair characterization of a fair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fair point. Because we don't want to put everyone through this excruciating exercise only to come back and have it fail. So it's. So do you want a vote to approve us going forward with a modified ordinance or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'd like. I think it would be helpful for us if there was a vote to direct staff to return to the Council with a revised list that encompasses the discussion that the council has made tonight, I think. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a for one, I think that will be okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Got it. Do I have such a motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, I could second that one because it's just to bring back revised lease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have a second. All in favor. I missed it. Oh, I. That's five, right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Technically, four other actions will roll.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? In the clinic, this is what happened to me late at night. Because we have a member who's not in the room. We actually have to go by a roll call vote. So we had a motion by Councilmember de Saka, second by Councilmember O.D. and now we're going to vote out, start wherever'",
        "'speaker_1': 'you want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilmember said. I'm not.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why don't any of them are here any more?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because this.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I understand that we do have speaker slips and I understand that they have committed to speaking really fast. And and I first of all, I apologize for keeping you out this late. Sometimes, you know, you can look an agenda and go, oh, how long could you know?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's mostly just regular agenda items. How long would it take? Well, you never know is the answer, but you do. This is a very important program and you do important work. So let's call you up. You've got 3 minutes, but don't feel that you have to take your full 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But you have our rapt attention. Okay, Madam Clerk.'",
