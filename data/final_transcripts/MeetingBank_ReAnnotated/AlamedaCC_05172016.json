    "Informational Report on Citys Facility Condition Assessments.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to consider an infinite information report on the city's facility condition assessment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have a staff report. Do we have any speakers on this item? All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Madam Mayor, members of the City Council. I'm Liam Garland with the Public Works Department. Here in Public Works, we have a little bit of a chip on our shoulder about not having the most exciting items to present. Tonight, we're going to be talking with you about our facilities, condition assessment and also some changes to our municipal code'",
        "'speaker_8': 'regarding construction contracting may be in order to get this get our creative juices flowing. We've got a quiz to start off tonight. This is not a quiz that is public. Well, in a sense, we're being watched. So it's a pop quiz.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If I had to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have the audience participate and we have a lifeline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is the smiley face significant?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You take it away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if I had the Jeopardy! Theme music, I would be playing it right now. But I do not have. So tonight we're going to talk a little bit about facilities management and we're going to walk through three questions that test your knowledge of good practices in facilities management and a little bit about what our existing inventory of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'facilities, what the scope of visit it is. So here's our first question. City buildings cover 500,000 square feet. That's roughly the size of a the Golden Gate Bridge. Yes. There we go. That is the answer. That is pretty amazing, isn't it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not what I would have guessed. It's also three times the size of Oracle Arena. Now let's contrast that with the number of public works staff funded for city building. Maintenance is the answer 13.58.25 or 20. And I always wonder who those haves and quarters are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I was going to ask. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The answer is be. So it's a nice contrast. Isn't a lot of building to maintain, along with not a lot of people to maintain it. And one way to think about this is what if you were told that the Golden Gate Bridge only had three and a half people maintaining it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How safe would you feel going across that bridge now? These three and a half people, they actually they maintain a lot more than that in the sense that they're dealing with daily toilet toilets, overflowing, leaky faucets, all the sort of day to day maintenance work of facilities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Finally, and this one's a little bit of a giveaway. When in doubt, always go. Which of the following are best practices in facilities management? Well, we've got the condition assessment, which we're going to hit in a couple of minutes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Maintenance, management systems. I've been in front of this body before talking about our computerized maintenance management system, LUSARDI, that we're rolling out through all of our different assets groups while facilities maintenance becomes a part of that computerized maintenance management system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then also long term capital plans. You might remember our capital budget from 2015 where we talked quite a bit about the facilities and deferred maintenance there and some of the long term plant plans we're developing. And so that's why for three, the answer is D.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I hope that got a little bit of the the neurons flowing. Now we're going to transition into our formal facility condition assessment presentation. Before we do that. I want to introduce Abdullah Ahmed, who's going to be supporting tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He is one of our newest project managers. He comes to us from Southern California with a tons of facilities management and project management experience, literally has taught the class on project management. So he is or has been instrumental in terms of getting these two items in front of us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So thank you, Abdullah and Laura, we okay with the next presentation? Oh, yes. Yes, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe. All right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is actually pretty rewarding to be up here discussing this because back in 2014, if you would have asked us about how the the condition of our facilities and where the information for that condition assessment was can be contained, the answer would have been not in my brain, but in a lot of our staff's brains and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in paper in quite a few different places. And so I just want to show you a little bit of a visual demonstrating that. Take a look at those systems. It doesn't strike you as a super reliable system for facilities, condition information.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And here's where we're pretty excited about the new maintenance management system, because all of the information that we've gleaned through these condition assessments, which we're going to talk about, is now in our maintenance management system. So it's in one place for our staff to access, access, rather than all of these different places in paper or in people's'",
        "'speaker_8': 'brains. We think that's a a big step forward for for our department. Now, back in 2014, we and the City Council agreed to bring in a third party facilities condition assessment expert Notts Faithful and Gold. They looked at our 38 facilities, essentially identifying where corrective actions need to be taken and also importantly what the cost estimates for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'those corrective actions were. Here is a list of the 38 buildings. It's a long list. It's got 30 buildings. Yes. And so these are facility condition assessment reports, actually. Just give me one moment. This is up. Sorry. This is volume one of these facility condition assessments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So each building has its own assessment 52, a 75 page document detailing all of the different corrective actions that Faith on Gold has recommended. So fairly extensive. As you can see here on the slide, they're covering all aspects of building facilities, everything from the envelope, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, you name it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's in these these reports. Now, the next thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if a member of the public or council wants to see what's actually being suggested per item, if we come and check out this, how does that work?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. Just reach out to me. Well, happy to share it. And a member of the public could always do the same thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next two slides are not building by building information instead of their rolled up information. So in other words, if you take all of that data and the underlying condition assessments, you then roll them up. You come up with some good and some not so good news.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want to share the good news first, which is that if you look at our current facilities, we've got about 50% of our facilities in good condition. So the building we're in now, the good news is it's in good condition and that really is good news.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's this is a building that's being accessed by the public frequently. It's where many city staff and our electeds reside. So it's important to have facilities in good condition. The other side of that is we have 50% of our facilities not in good condition.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The number that I'm really hoping sticks in your brain coming out of tonight's presentation is that number in the lower right hand corner, that over $12 million in immediate capital needs. Let me explain a little bit about what that means.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is the number derived from faithful in gold. And essentially it it is a roll up of capital needs that need to happen without. And if they do not happen, we're going to suffer larger expense later. So you think about an H fax system that has a 20 to 25 year life, but it's it's actually 35 years'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in. And so we can either wait for that to fail. And if we do, our costs are going to go dramatically up in terms of its replacement and then lost use of that facility. Or we can replace it now and save that future repair cost.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so that's an example of those immediate capital needs. We're talking roof replacements where we have roofs that are leaking HVAC upgrades, substantial electrical upgrades. That's what's represented in that over $12 million. Now, I want you to imagine for a moment that coming out of tonight and the next year, we did nothing around facilities maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in other words, no further investments in our facilities. Oh, the picture would get dramatically worse in the next ten years. And again, this is where we're we're focusing on that a little bit above $12 Million number. That number would turn to nearly $35 million if we were to do nothing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Even more that remember where currently we're at, about 50% of our buildings are in good condition. We'll look at that number ten years out. That number is 8% of our facilities in good condition. It's all to say. This underlines the case for doing something sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the good news is this council has already done some things. You approved about $2 million in high priority facility repairs back in September with some of those general surplus funds. Let me back up a little bit and just show a few photos of the kinds of conditions that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You see a couple or a few slides related to water intrusion coming through roofs. Ironically, in the upper right hand corner, that's our maintenance services center. That's where our maintenance workers who come out to other city facilities to catch water or try to repair roofs on the fly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're also getting dripped upon. That's what that that photo in the upper right hand corner shows in this next set of slides. You see, we've got lots of pavement and asphalt that needs to be repaired and lots of equipment that needs to be replaced.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the middle there you see the middle, lower middle, you see that missing downspouts. That's an example of something we would call preventative maintenance. So in other words, that Downspouts is helping protect that building's foundation from water running into it when it's missing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Obviously, that's not good for the foundation of the building. And so that's an example of the kind of work we want to do in preventative maintenance. We want to do more of this kind of kind of work. So what's next?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, we propose to do is we're not asking for any approvals tonight. We want to come back in February of 2017 with some ideas for how we can bridge our facilities maintenance funding gap. And you may ask, why am I not asking tonight for that money?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And for one, because that's what a capital and operating budget process is for. It's for folks sitting in your position to weigh the competing interests of different, different priorities and to make decisions around that. And so in February 2017, we will likely have kicked off the operating capital budget process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we want to present options to you for first how to bridge that 12. Remember, I talked about that $12 million we're likely to raise over the next ten years or so, about seven and a half million that we can put toward those $12 million in repairs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That leaves about $4.8 million for those high priority facility repairs. We want to we want to propose a way to bridge that gap, probably with some general fund surplus dollars if they exist. The second the second part of that gap is a bigger one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's about the deferred maintenance. It's not about the big projects. It's more about that that downspouts that needs to be replaced. It's also about painting or in fact, systems, making sure we get a technician out every year who checks that HVAC system to ensure that it's operating properly.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's not leaking out. That kind of year to year. Maintenance can extend the life of that HVAC system and save the city money over the long term. In some ways, what we'll be back in front of you proposing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's a little bit like two spouses discussing a vehicle that they own that is in disrepair. So what the facility's condition assessment has done is it said what in the vehicle is working, what's not, what needs to be replaced, what's the routine maintenance that's going to happen next?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And now the spouses are having a discussion about, okay, now we've got some dollar values for that. Where are we going to invest this money and where's the money going to come from? Is somebody going to get a promotion?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is there a will somewhere out there that's going to help us get there? And so that's what we're going to be back in February 2017 to discuss is with some direction from you on dollar values. We then can turn out the first two years of the facility's capital budget.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We can then have the long term facility CIP plan and then as much as we can around that preventative maintenance plan. So that's what we're proposing to come back to you in February of 2017. And with that, if there's any questions that Bob Abdullah or I can answer, we're here to answer them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As a member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had one. Thank you for that. Nice presentation, Mr. Garland. Can you tell us of the the list of the 38 facilities inspected and assessed? That's on page four of your presentation. Um, are all of these buildings projected to be in use in the next year to three, five years?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I had a couple of specific questions. So number 18, Building 76 pool is that the pool out at the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At Alameda point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To point. So it's not used now, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, I believe it's not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not correct. So, I mean, what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much how much money would we be putting into something that I think eventually is going to be replaced? Because, you know, we have plans for a nice recreation center at Alameda Point eventually.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Definitely. Sorry if I interrupted. Especially because any dollar we put into a building that is that might not be used in the future is a dollar we're taking away from another building that's being used on a daily basis by the public.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those are definitely decisions that public works will make and also keep the city council informed about in terms of what buildings we might not invest substantial dollars in terms of facility maintenance. The buildings at Alameda Point, honestly, they're a bit tough, right, because we don't know over the long term where they're going to be and whom whose'",
        "'speaker_8': 'hands and how they're used. So that that's a question that honestly, we're still wrestling with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So we can take a closer look. And the other one I wondered about and it's, you know, very close to where we are right now. But the veterans building, what percentage of that building is in use at any given time?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've taken the occasional dance class there through an RPG. When my kids were teenagers, they were involved in the activities in the teen underground or whatever that nice program is at LAPD runs. But what percentage of that building is used in on a regular basis?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a good question. I do not know the answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Add that to our list. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions? Comment My Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A minor question on your chart about the facilities. It'll still be good if we do nothing. You have a marina village there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What's that doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There? What is it?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what? What we did was in some of our our what I call special districts, our landscape and lighting districts, homes, we have part of the components that relate to the public infrastructure out there. What we did was look long term what what needed to be replaced in those areas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So boardwalk, lighting, etc.. And so we're building that into long term plans and then running that against the revenue that's brought in through assessments. So that's what that Marina Village is about. It's about the landscaping lighting district, I think at zone five or six.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know what I can say about that because I live next to the park. Can I say anything about that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Precious little.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Never mind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Comments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just remember. Suck.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you very much for your presentation and for focusing public attention on the variety of facilities operated and managed by the city of Alameda for which continuing upkeep is needed in the short and a long term. Now, it seems to me that as we move forward on your the long term facilities planning and making sure to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'maintain these facilities, we might also have that discussion in the context of other CHP items so that we're not making the decision with regard to facilities in a vacuum. I know, for example, a lot of people are always asking me about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Frankly, their own streets. And that if you go down San Antonio Avenue, for example, I think that Street has not been paved in in a while. And it is it is getting to have some wear. And I just mentioned San Antonio Avenue, west of Grand Street as an example.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But but. So there's a lot of tremendous needs that which when not attended. Will lead to even greater needs for the reasons that you discussed below. Something that's not invested in upkeep now. The costs go up. I don't know if it's an exponential going up, but it goes up at a higher rate than normal.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that just means that we have that that many more challenges so that. The thing that I would recommend for sure then is that as we move forward with your capital facilities long term plan, that we also have that conversation in conjunction with other items that are typically on our recipe for which, you know, there's been a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'lot of deferred maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks for the presentation. You know, I also echo the comments that my colleagues made, you know, to two quick points. You know, one, I know last year when we had our reserves and we allocated our excess reserves, we did tackle some deferred maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know the vice mayor has been a champion of tackling these deferred maintenance issues before they become worse. So hopefully I know you said February of next year we'll have a plan, but if there is some excess one time money that we can do this year, you know, I'd like to you to be prepared at least to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'give us, you know, what the high priority items are that we might be able to attack this year rather than next year. And I also agree that it's a good idea to get this plan and get this baked in our our ongoing budget so we can start addressing these these problems.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. So I was just going to go back to the $12.3 million figure you gave us for rehabilitating or addressing buildings that were in poor the worst condition. So of that 12.3 million, some of these were buildings that we talked about or facilities like the pool at Alameda Point that might not ever come into use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And I wanted to ask when this comes back, I'd like to know historically, for instance, for the last 3 to 5 years how much has been allocated for maintenance and deferred maintenance annually and then the occupancy of City Hall West.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know when you're evaluating the different buildings, that's another one. I was asked specifically about what's going on there. If you can try to share what's going on in some of these buildings that people may not know what they have, how the city does use these buildings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then on the animal shelter. We did have a meeting with some finance representatives and they. And they may have met with you. I'm not sure. I just wanted to make sure that you coordinate with them. I know that they do have some serious needs in regards to the facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Yes. All right. That being said at this point, is that all the direction you need or.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is for information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're good. We can move on then. Yes. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Now we will go to six be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Introduction of ordinance, amending the Alameda Municipal Code by amending various sections of Article four and five contracts and administrative procedures and policies concerning conformance of all bidding procedures on public works projects to public contract code 22 zero 32 in California.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting. I'm switching it. Liam.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very much. Again, Liam Garland from Public Works and these two items are intimately connected. And let me just explain that before we jump in, which is that one of the challenges we see with getting all of these facility projects done is that we've got some construction contracting, municipal code provisions that are out of date.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's what this item is about, is about updating those municipal code provisions regarding construction bidding. So with that, let me give you an overview of what public works is asking and then we'll jump into the details about the request and why.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the first is you see that at the top of the slide is currently any construction project, over $75,000 has to come to City Council for approval before that contract can be finalized. What staff is recommending is that we update our municipal code, which has not been updated in about 26 years, to be consistent with what the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'state law is in the area. And that's $175,000. And I'll give you the reasons behind that in just a moment. But that's what our first request is. The second is to have the city council, and this is on the bottom portion of that slide.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's to have the city council designate approval of plans and specifications. I said that incorrectly. Let me start that over to delegate to the city, engineer approval of a project's plans and specifications. So without further ado, let's jump in to what are the goals for this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this is not coming out of nowhere. It is obviously related a little bit more than a little bit to the work we're doing around facilities and seeing the challenge around some delays on the contracting side because of an out and out to date and out of date code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They're also besides just getting up to date on code, we think we can save about 10% on project expenses by having our code up to date. We think we can save for months on a project's timeline by updating the code, and that's quite a bit of time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This, of course, will enable us to complete the ambitious number of facility ships we do want to complete. We think there's going to be another benefit, which is that with the streamlined bidding procedures for projects up to 175,000, we believe that this is going to make that work more competitively, more competitive to be bid on by local'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and smaller contractors. Essentially, local and smaller contractors don't have an administrative wing of their firms to respond to cities of formal bidding requirements. The last two are really about the delegating the authority of the city engineer to approve plans and specs, and it's about increasing the city's immunity from potential legal claims related to those plans and specs'",
        "'speaker_8': '. We'll talk in a little bit of detail about that. And then finally, we want to eliminate some unnecessarily unnecessary city council approval. So these are the goals of the municipal code update. You'll see here. This is section two, Dash 61 from our municipal code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It shows that $75,000 construction contracting threshold. In other words, we have to have city council approval for construction contracts over $75,000. You'll see the date here, February six of 1990. This has not been updated since then. This was also the same year that we opted in as a city to the construction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. California Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act. I am not going to say that again. It's Koepka. I will say that a few more times. We opted into Koepka in the year of 1990. Koepka has since been updated five different times and we have not kept current with that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so that's why the increase from I'm sorry, the $175,000, that's koepka's current contracting threshold. And the revision we're proposing is essentially to have our code point to Koepka. And as there are future adjustments to that code, our code will also be adjusted.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Here. You can see websites from the state comptroller's office who's involved in the updating of the construction contracting thresholds, essentially looking at what construction contract costs, what's the direction of those which is obviously up and making sure that these thresholds are kept up or updated consistent with the direction of construction costs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Here where we take a look at what other cities in the bay area who are in Cook what they've done and you'll see that that the top 11 there they are all consistent with where Cooper Cooper is currently.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You'll see there's another five that are not consistent with where Cooper is currently, but they're above where where Alameda is. This slide shows the four months that we think we can save on our typical construction projects should this item be approved tonight?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, this is why one of the reasons why we're coming at this now is because we're looking at these facility repairs, a bunch of which will be in the range of that 75 to 175000. And we think this is going to give us and public works a real opportunity to get more of that work done in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a shorter time. Let me clarify a little bit about what this item is not. We are not making any changes to our current code regarding prevailing wages. We're not changing this body's governing of the budget and the approval of all of the projects in our capital budget.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, this doesn't change that that obligation or responsibility of the city council whatsoever. There's also another important point here, which is a construction contracting law is pretty clear in California. You award to the lowest responsible bidder, period. It's why these items end up on our consent calendar.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't have much discretion in the matter whatsoever. And so that doesn't change either. If that changes, Bob Abdullah and I walk out of here in handcuffs. So construction contracts have to go to the lowest responsible bidder, and there is no change to that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So now I'm going to turn to the second part of tonight's item, and that is a proposed change where we're having the city council designate authority to approve plans and specs to the specifications to the city engineer. Oh, and I want to start just high level.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what is this about? And if you look at the photos here, this is primarily about our annual maintenance capital project. So you've got on the left photo, you've got our street resurfacing project, on our center photo, you've got our sewer main replacements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And on the right we have several pump station renovations. And these are the kind of projects that come up every single year. And the council has the option options the wrong word has the authority of approving these projects first in the capital budget.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then, if they are either facilities or new parks, they go to the planning board and staff's committed, in addition that for new facilities and new parks, we'd bring those plans and specs to City Council to be another opportunity for approval.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then on contract award, it's back in front of council. So the change tonight is only on the piece for approval of plans and specifications and only for projects that are like these routine maintenance projects, the street resurfacing, the sewer main replacement and the pump station renovations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So then the question is, obviously, by the way, there's a gain in time for public works. We can get more projects done without having to gain the City Council's approval of plans and specs. When we've got a city engineer who's got the expertize in the area who can approve those plans and specs, something is different today versus'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a couple of years ago. Case law has changed and now there's increased risk of a later legal claim if there's any change in those plans and specs once the work is done out in the field. And so what those court cases suggest is those changes don't have the immunity that's garnered with this city council's approval of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'plans and specs. And every set of plans and specifications change once you get into the field. So that's a that is a an issue, which is if we want to better protect the city, then delegating that authority to the city engineer when invariably there's going to be changes to those plans and specs that best provides the city'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the legal defense it needs for any claims of improper design or plan coming out of those plans and specifications. So with that, I'm going to leave this slide up here with the two changes. I should say one other thing, which is if you do approve this item tonight, we've got a typo actually in the proposed ordinance where'",
        "'speaker_8': 'we refer to a subsection of Cooper when that reference should be a subsection F. No. Reverse. We refer to a subsection F when the subsection should be referring to D. So as long as we can incorporate that into if there's a successful motion, then we'll be where we need to be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With that, I'm happy to take any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. First, clarifying questions and councilmember clarifying questions. All right. I have clarifying questions then when you go back to your presentation, when you had approval by the city engineer as opposed to city council, does that mean that currently city engineer does not approve these along the process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'City city and approves them, but then they need to come to city council for a final approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you look at your chart. I. I don't know which page it had. You had four steps. Okay. On page ten.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You don't have if you don't have a step there that shows the city engineer approving. So that currently happened. When does that happen?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it would happen before the plans inspects were submitted to the City Council for approval. Essentially that's a city engineer stamping the plans inspector saying These are good to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So it does currently happen. So we would still we would just continue that. So the. Question here is where you're being asked then to remove the city council as part of this process. But it would still go to the planning board and the city engineer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And who is our city engineer?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's great that you mention that. I am proud to announce Shriram Agami here, who I just if I ever have an opportunity to give a few words about him.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you could approach the podium so that the audience can see you also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So Shriram has literally decades of civil engineering experience, comes to us from over in Oakland, which is experiencing similar conditions in terms of a built out city with lots of aged infrastructure and also Shriram. Once you get to know him, you'll realize he's got all the engineering skills and he's got a personality to boot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He came through a really competitive selection process and was the 100% consensus choice. So I'm really happy to be introducing Sharan tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And I. It's my first it's my debut session with the council, and it's been an exciting one. And I enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The staff that I'm working with. And we have we have many interesting projects coming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our way and we hope we look forward to working with the council on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Welcome and thank you for joining us this evening. All right. Any other questions or comments? No. All right. So then we do we have speakers on this item. No speakers on this item. Okay. So then we can discuss this item now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think. Increasing the threshold is just a reflection of how much things cost today versus how much they cost years ago. I'm still a little. Can. I'm not so concerned about the the relinquishing of the council approval of the plants and specs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand of the the intent. Um, I. I do think this chart that's on slide number. Is it or. Is is a little confusing to me still because I, I think you explain that the council and the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look at the plans for the new facilities and approve that. It's that one. Yes. But then there'll be when those specs come back reflecting that plan. What I'm understanding is there's no need to go to council with those engineering specs for council approval, and I agree with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'None of us are engineers. None of us can stamp that. So I think this is a good opportunity. And I'd like to move that. We. Adopt this consideration with the caveat that at the end of a year we have an assessment of Did it work?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what were the problems? So I think we can make these adjustments. But I'd like to quantify the result.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other council members. The member. Member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll second that motion with the technical amendment that you mentioned, if that's okay with the vice mayor. I don't really have anything more to add than Frank already said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, Jason?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the thing that I want to add two basic points. One is the shifting from the $75,000 threshold to the hundred $75,000 threshold. You know, I think it looks like a big number. And it is I mean, even the 75,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think it's important to take into account that the 75,000 was set in 1990. So simply when you input the $75,000 into West Edgecomb, it comes out to be roughly 138,000 in today's dollars. So really, the the change is $138000 to $175000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think in that light, while I did have some early concerns about the going to the upper threshold, I that's certainly something that I can live with. And having the reporting along the lines that vice mayor at RCN indicated in one year's time, we certainly like to see if it is, for example, true that there were that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'much more locally owned businesses that that were less able to participate. The second point I want to get to, though, is I am concerned about the city engineering replacing the council. One of the advantage advantages of having the council approve the plans and specs is that, you know, we have a lot of residents who are very engaged'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in our city, many of them themselves, engineers of one type or another who have on some occasions attended city council meetings to point things out that perhaps. You know, the public might want to know. So on that, frankly, because the city engineer still is involved in the process, I prefer the status quo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't know how much more to say about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mayor Spencer. I think it's important for municipal law to reflect the current state law. And I'm married to a construction lawyer, so those numbers don't make me bat an eyelash. I agree with the vice mayor that I don't have a degree in engineering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And while I can read a planner aspect, that's about as far as it goes, but I would look to a professional. And also, while I understand that we have a very engaged population, I know that the professionals we have working for the city are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Working for the city. I know the standards that they are adhering to, and I have confidence in the fact that I expect them to do their professional job without it being politicized. Sometimes we have very well-meaning public members of the public, but oftentimes there's there's an agenda at work there, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm very comfortable with I'm glad that we finally firmly filled that city engineer's position. And I think we've got a good team on board. And I compliment you, Mr. Garland, you've done two nice reports for us here this evening, so I am fully prepared to support this motion with the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I and I just would also throw in that certainly come back to us in a year's time and tell us what you found. Give us another pretty presentation. But I don't know if a year's time will be enough to say that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And X-number more local contractors have now gotten work because I think it takes a little time for these things to percolate. So, you know, let's let's take a look, but let's also be patient because those results could take more than one year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to walk through this chart again. If I'm reading this correctly, the first time city council approves it is in the budget and our that our two year budget. Yes. So when I recall it's in there, it's actually posted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it's no information about a project. It would be a dollar amount. The dollar amount that we would be approving.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's fairly, fairly detailed. The Capitol had a copy of the capital budget here. It's definitely not insubstantial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that so there's detail in the budget about the project that would be approved. Detail.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. In the capital budget work covering the number of sidewalk repairs we're going to do, the number of miles of sewer main replacement identified, the pump stations that we're renovating, etc.. That's all listed in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And we approve that as one agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe in the last budget process you had a presentation from me about the capital budget specifically. That was one of the study sessions. And then in the final approval of the budget, it was both operating and capital budget that were approved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. And there was some discussion of the capital budget within that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then it goes to the planning board. If it's pertaining to a park or a new facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A new park or a new facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And the planning board makes those approvals and that does not come to council. That's why it would end there into this new process. It would not come to council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, no, no. It would come to council. So staff is committed to making sure that new parks and new facilities come to city council. It's the routine maintenance projects that would not come to council for approval of the plans and specifications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And the projects that would be specified during the budget process. That's when we that's when council would approve each project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then so this chart of the city council approving plans and specs, that is the items then that are in the budget. We will not have it come back again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, you'll see them again when the contracts are up for approval in front of the city council, but not at the stage of approving plans and specifications. Unless it's a new city facility or a new city park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And now it's my understanding we. So you just introduced to us our new city engineer. But have we not had a city engineer? Or is he replacing someone or we've had a vacancy there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, we've had a city engineer who is stamping documents, stamping plans and specifications. We've had that city engineer under contract. So there's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Your contract.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So this process, if at some point we don't have an employee who's a city engineer, then we would still have this process of sending those out to whomever is under contract. Or are we planning to, from this point forward, have an in-house city engineer?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I am ecstatic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that what's happening here?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Yes. Shriram is going to be here. And it's my job to keep that position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Filling that position in house is not related to this process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A of regard. So we need a city engineer in house regardless of what the council decision is tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's what I would think. And I think it's I would agree that we need an in-house city engineer. And I would be but I would be concerned about approving a process that eliminates council that sends if, in fact, we don't have a city engineer, that then with consent, you know, as we have in the past.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would agree that it is important to have a city engineer moving forward. That that's a critical part of this process. But remember, De Saag, it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just a quick question in terms of types of plans that are being approved in the third arrow in your design. Let me give you an example. Say, the city of Alameda approves it as part of its CHP redoing a street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So at the third arrow, is that the point in time? Would it be up to the city engineer to approve a plan or that street as to whether or not it's going to be treated with what do you call service slurry seal versus something more grinding and redo?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So is the city engineer basically saying what kind of treatment is going to be done for a street?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh, yes. That is a typical city engineer role in this instance. What the city engineer is doing is typically that decision has already been made, but developing the plans and specifications for whether it's a slurry, sealing, complete reconstruction, and then what the city engineer does is is approves those and they then can be bid they go out'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for bid. The lowest responsible bidder is awarded to after it comes back to council for that contract award to be approved.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So just not to be mysterious. So what I'm trying to get at is in some instances, it's obviously cheaper just to fill a pothole or deal with roads with, you know, the I think there are three different types of treatments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can't remember slurry, seal and whatever. But in the long run, it always ends up costing more if you do the short run cheap treatment. So what I'm trying to get at is that what treatment that needs to be used for streets is a decision of the council, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then it is up to the city engineer in this process that you've laid out to to see how the plan is meeting whatever treatment is is agreed upon for a street. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can answer the question. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what happens during the budget process is that the city council will approve X number of dollars for a street reconstruction, x miles of reconstruction. The city engineer working with one of our senior engineers will come up with the plan for how to accomplish accomplish that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city engineer in turn under this will approve those plans and specs so that they will go out for bid bid and then that contract will come back to you for approval of that doesn't covers, you know, essentially a small pothole repair.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's a whole nother a whole nother being. And my answering your question or. No?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I think not exactly. I think what I'm trying to get at is there is a street that has a rate and that needs to be repaired. And the types of repairs that could be done on the street could be low level or maybe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we because we do that, because it's cheaper or maybe we do a higher level, but we don't because it's more expensive. But then in the long run, it costs more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bob Hahn, Public Works Director. The streets are categorized by the PCI, the pavement condition index. It's a program run by MTC and they evaluate all the streets. We feed them the information and they evaluate all the streets. So the treatment on any specific street is related directly to the PCI of that street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'OC of the PCI is very low. It means the street has deteriorated. And beyond potholes, areas are coming up. You have complete areas that are failed. That is the condition where you would grind the whole street down and repave the street over completely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. A slurry seal is appropriate for a street like ten year old. Okay, so with the ten year old street, it's still in good condition, it's still tight. And that PCI is probably somewhere in 68 or something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That street just by that number would get a slurry seal because there's no reason to tear up the whole street. We wouldn't tear up a street unless a couple of reasons. Number one, if we were tearing it up to put pipes in and I want to remind the council that we're on a very aggressive program right now'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of replacing three miles of sewer throughout the city for the next 23 years. And that is driving our pavement program because we have worked very closely with both East Bay Mud and PGD, and we have given them a 20 year look out of the streets that we're going to be replacing sewers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have invited them to the party and to jump into those streets in a two year period after we got our sewers down. Sewers are typically at the lower level. Okay. And then they will come in and do their infrastructure repair and then eventually that street will be repaved over completely because it will have all kinds'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of cuts in it. And then fine.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, just to summarize then, it's the treatment for a street is driven by the PCI. And the role of the engineer is simply to make sure that the treatment that is being implemented is done engineering appropriately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So if you have a PCI of 78, it would take a slurry seal. If you have a PCI of 60, you might want to grind that whole street down.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what I was trying to get at was that so it's not up to the engineer to determine it's the PCI.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's it's a calculation that every city goes through. That's how streets are prioritized. We are prioritizing our streets right now based upon our sewer program, but we also have additional money to address those streets that are deteriorating. We're not ignoring the streets where we're really trying to concentrate in a strategic manner, how to replace the sewer pipe'",
        "'speaker_2': ', how to get everybody in. But we don't want to do is we pay the street and all of a sudden the next day, Piccini says, Oh, I need to expand that pipe down there. I'm going to tear up your brand new street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, we've gone from at PCI of of 100 down to a PCI of 80 something overnight because now PGE has come in and torn it up. And once you open up that asphalt water gets in, that's how streets deteriorate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have one question. It's on the redlined ordinance and I believe that would be up to I think this is the council on page four, the section two, dash six, 1.4 award of construction contract. It says the city manager.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is authorized to award informed contracts pursuant to lowest responsive, responsible bidder. And the word responsive is new. No is being added. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Responsive? Has always been there. Okay. A responsive bidder gives us all the information that we have requested in the bid package. Okay. If the if a bitter left out a piece of paper that we needed in that bid, then he is nonresponsive and he's thrown out of the pool because he did not comply with all the the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'things that we requested to be submitted at that point. So that's a non responsive a non responsible bidder is somebody that maybe has a history of botching jobs over the past five years. We do a little history search on the contractor and find out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the city of Walnut Creek said they're never going to use this guy again. That changes our attitude and that's a non responsible bidder. If that can be proven, a non responsible bidder has a right for a hearing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Any other questions or comments at this point? All those in favor, I suppose. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make one quick clarification, please, in case you need to revote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is the first reading of the ordinance. And so so I wanted to make sure that the direction that you gave to staff to come back with an assessment of how this works.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Introduction of ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by amending Chapter 30, clarifying text amendments to Section 3058 through 3050 9.3 of the zoning ordinance related to water efficient landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the Council. I'm Ellen Tai, Planning Services Manager, Community Development Department. Hopefully this is going to be an easy one. The municipal code has had a water conservation landscaping ordinance since the early nineties and over the years we've been updating that ordinance corresponding to changes in state law.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the current ordinance in front of you is really corresponding to the Governor Brown's executive order last summer addressing the statewide severe drought. Specifically, this ordinance does three things. Number one, it tightens the performance measures on water conservation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So irrigation devices for landscaping has now have to save more water. And there are a lot of technical calculations associated with it. Two, the ordinance in the state law, what it does is it lowers the threshold for what sort of landscaping projects would be subject to these new requirements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So essentially expanding the amount of land that would subject be subject to water conservation requirements. And third, because these changes are new, what the state did was it prescribed a more standardized process where applicants can fill out standardized forms to demonstrate compliance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So those in a nutshell, that's really the major change to this ordinance in Safford and the planning board are recommending approval because it's good for the environment, saves water and we're required to do it by the state.'",

So Alameda Municipal Power is a member of that group and they've initiated the suit, the purpose of which is to reduce the payments for environmental remediation that Alameda Municipal Power pays.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the Central Valley Project, which includes the Shasta Dam, it is required by law every year to do very extensive environmental remediation to balance out the damage that this existing project does. They in turn pass that on to their customers, including Alameda Municipal Power.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Alameda Municipal Power wants to pay less for this environmental remediation. I have no opinion on the merits of that litigation, but in my opinion, when you're in a hole, stop digging. If you want to pay less for environmental remediation, then we shouldn't build more environmental problems that we then have to remediate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Nina Gordon Kirsch.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. My name is Nina. It's my first time at a city hall meeting. It's very exciting. I'm from Friends of the River and I have a lot of training in the water industry. I did a Fulbright scholarship in Israel about wastewater treatment, and then I continued and did my master's degree in environmental economics, and I wrote my'",
        "'speaker_1': 'thesis on a cost effectiveness analysis of wastewater treatment options. So I'm familiar with cost benefit analysis. The Temperance Flat Dam proposal doesn't make any sense from a cost benefit analysis perspective. The costs there's financial costs, $2.6 billion, and growing projects like that always increase in costs as they continue to get built.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's environmental costs, fisheries, damaged ecosystems of where the reservoir will be. A lot of those plants will get ruined. There's also cultural costs, such as the Native Americans that use that river and that whole area. And then there's benefits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's an increase in water supply, but it's only about 70,000 acre feet per year. And that's a tiny, tiny percentage. That's like point 2% of California state water needs as a whole. So it's a really small percentage. Um, and then there's also hydropower, which is a benefit, and the project is proposed to create 160 megawatts of watt'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of electricity per year. Yet creation of this dam will actually flood two existing hydropower plants. And the net, there's a net loss in electricity production. So as much as there might be some hydropower created in this dam proposal, the overall power creation will decrease.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that doesn't make any sense. Um, so I just want to say that if Allen, if the AMP is focused on increasing renewable energy like hydropower, this isn't the answer. And there's been a lot of proposals and I think five different proposals and none of them have have shown to be successful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you for joining us. Richard Baer. And then he's our last speaker on this item. If you'd like to speak on the side and please turn on your slip.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Members of the Council on City Staff. I support the letter. I think it's unfortunate that our municipal power company, whose middle name is Green, recommended that you take a neutral position on this. In this case, neutral is not benign.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neutral says that you're willing to live with the consequences. In the case of the Temperance Flat Dam of flooding, an area that another branch of the Interior Department has recommended for designation as a national, wild and scenic river.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think this points up a shortcoming of the AMP scorecard on what is green and. In their calculation. Apparently, the only way this river has any value is if money can be derived by sending water to agribusiness or generating power.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as as a previous speaker pointed out, it's not really going to be a net increase in power. This isn't the first time, by the way, that our municipal park company has been on the wrong side of the river, so to speak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About six years ago, when the Department of Interior recommended changing the water flow allocation on the Trinity River. Previously, up until that point, 90% went to agribusiness and power generation, 10% to the fish or the fishery. They wanted to raise it to 47% for the fishery.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The rest to who? Agribusiness and power generation. What did our local power company do? They joined with the Northern California Power Association or agency filing suit to try and prevent implementation of that. Our city only withdrew from that lawsuit after there was a public uproar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Same thing happened in Palo Alto, Sacramento Utility District, Port of Oakland. And so I think. I think you should not remain neutral. You should take a firm stand. And some people may think, well, this is a little far afield.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it's no farther afield than sister city in Asia. You know, maybe we should have Sister Rivers take a road trip.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you very much. And this is a lot closer than a sister city in Asia. This is right here in the state of California, in northern California. So I brought this as a referral. I think that the language in the letter is very straightforward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This year, the fate of three of California's outstanding rivers, McCloud, Sacramento, San Joaquin, are in our hands. And I agree with the last speaker that doing nothing is not doing nothing. And it is actually time. I submit it's time it is appropriate for us to take a position on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yes, given that there's enormous cost for dubious results and in the long term, I think we're we're better off following the approach that this letter supports. I move that we as a council sign this letter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would second that. Yes.'",

    "Future Structure of ABAG and Possible Merger with MTC.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Consider having council endorse one or combination of options for the future structure of the Association of Area Governments, including an option to merge with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, which requires Council action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And member Ashcraft brought this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. So this is my item because I represent Alameda on the Association of Bay Area Governments. I'm going to try to make a complicated situation, straightforward and simple. So a brief history. First of all, of what a bag association of Bay Area Governments is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was formed in 1961 as a voluntary association of the Bay Area's 101 cities and nine counties, recognizing that common issues cross jurisdictional boundaries. Some of the work that a bag does today include forecasts of the region's housing, jobs and population growth identifying regional housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You've heard the term RINO, which stands for Regional Housing Needs Allocation, and that comes from a bag of statistics and research and also addressing resilience, which has to do with things like earthquakes and other disasters, recognizing that they don't tend to stop at, you know, city borders or county borders prepares issues, climate change reports and prepares elements'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the Sustainable Communities Strategy, which is a guideline for how cities and counties comply with Senate Bill 375, which sets targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicle trips through regional allocation of housing needs and regional transportation planning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there is the and another example just in Alameda, we talk often about sea level rise and we are an island and we have some low lying areas. And there's actually a steady area out on Bay from island that is part of and a big, steady, empty sea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The Metropolitan Transportation Commission was created by the California legislature in 1970 to receive and allocate federal and state funding to support transportation and related infrastructure in the Nine Bay Area counties. You probably use some MTC programs and services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I bet you. I hope almost all of us have clipper cards in our pockets or wallets. Maybe your car has a fast track electronic toll collection that comes through MTC, the new Bay Bridge. Okay, there's been a little controversy, but they were MTC was on that project and they're also helping bring BART to San Jose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But elsewhere in California and around the country, local COGS funds, courts, councils, councils of governments. Right. So a bag is considered a council, a government, because it's voluntary association of all of these different 101 cities, nine counties in the rest of the state and much of the country councils of government were designated the Metropolitan Planning Organization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's what MTC is creating a single unified planning agency for historical reasons. The Bay Area model is different, it's bifurcated, and in recent years it's led to some problems. So a consultant team was brought in. They're called management partners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the council all got a hefty 90 page report that I've summarized. So you don't have to write. I hopefully you read it too. They came. They identified three specific problems and presented seven options for how the two agencies could move forward more productively.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the three problems identified were the preparation of this Sustainable Communities Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is currently statutorily split between the two agencies. So there's two different planning staffs. They're doing some overlapping work, not always communicating so well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second is that both agencies have some responsibility for regional land use and transportation planning, but are not formally linked through integrated management, leadership or policy structure. And third, and in some ways most important, because again, I represent Alameda on a big we are a medium sized city but I think we could all agree we want to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make sure our voices heard. A bag has a financially fragile funding structure. It depends on grant funding each year and an and an annual allocation of money from the MTC. So. And I will just trying to be as diplomatic as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I also want to be factual. This whole discussion did not start out on the best footing because rather than appearing like merger talks, it had the appearance, more of the appearance of a hostile takeover from MTC when late last year the Metropolitan Transportation Commission passed a resolution that said, okay, we're merging the two, we're taking 13'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of 14 abig planters over to our side, a bag. You can have the planner who's dedicated to the Bay Trail. We're reducing 40% of your budget and something else, cutting your your workforce. And that led to an outcry, which was a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the there was a joint meeting of the executive boards of both Ardbeg and MTC. I give a lot of credit to Julie Pearce. She's a council member from the city of Clayton, currently the president of the bag board who said, not so fast, we need to have a voice at this table.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So both boards went back to the table, decided, oh, the other provision of the the original MTC resolution was that a study of how the merger should work would take place and how it could work and could be laid out, would take place after the merger happened.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The decision after the the uproar was know that the the study should take place first. So the council has looked at these maybe some of the public has there are seven options laid out. The the one that has gotten the recommendation from both Ezra Rapoport, the executive director of Air Bag and the Air Bag Executive Committee, as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'well as a former mayor. Gwen Regalia is a former mayor of Walnut Creek. And there's another woman who's a former San Mateo County supervisor, also endorse model for option four, which is to create a new regional agency and governance model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In other words, to have the Bay Area follow the sort of model that we see in the rest of the state and in other parts of the country, and have a unified Council of Government and Metropolitan Planning Organization, but in a carefully orchestrated fashion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Rappaport, the executive director of IBAC, wrote in a letter that he sent us. The new governance model should combine the best of Mtc's statutory responsibilities to program and allocate transportation dollars, while also supporting other non transportation issues facing the city faced facing the region.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, the concerns that have been raised. Okay. And I should hasten to add that the ABA Executive Board also recommended a second option if option four provided not viable, proved to be not viable because right now in the resolution 40 to 10, that's an MTC resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The revised resolution gives the two governing boards of Airbag and MTC only till July one, 2016, to come to an agreement on how to move forward and specifies that planning grants will terminate on that date, which right now is less than six weeks away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what Ezra went on to say is that while we see a change in governance is crucial to the long term mission of regional planning, we are convinced that the air bag and MTC boards cannot address governance in the timeframe needed to sustain a bag unless that the planning grant expires.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unless both boards adopt an alternative merger implementation plan, which probably can't happen by July 1st, in which case he would recommend Rapoport in the ABA Executive Board recommend the alternative, which is the approval of option seven. And Option seven is to enter into a contract between air bag and MTC to consolidate staff functions under one executive director'",
        "'speaker_3': '. We already know that Executive Director will be Mtc's Director Steve Hemminger and enter into an emotive memorandum of understanding to pursue new governance options. The and so and that option seven is the option that MTC would like to see adopted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um, I want to go on to just note briefly that management partners, the consultants that did this report, note that the implementation of Resolution 40. Putin ten would change airbags historic role as a regional land use planning agency, which is perceived by most stakeholders as having a staff sensitive to what local government interests and government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sensitive to local government interests and a governing body capable of representing the diversity of local government concerns. Placing a big staff under the empty MTC administrative structure could lead to a perception that IBAC has less influence and the management partners said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It also found that most local governments are very concerned about MTC, the Regional Transportation Agency, becoming a comprehensive regional planning agency, inclusive and responsive to local governments. And there is a significant concern for losing local control over important issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what I'm recommending, and I'm happy to hear from my fellow council members and see if I can answer any questions. Is that so? On Thursday of this week, I'll be attending the air bag General Assembly meeting in Oakland and the General Assembly, presuming we have a quorum, that 101 cities and nine counties will vote and our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'vote will be the direction we give to the bag board when it then meets in joint session, I think in the following week with the MTC board. So I have a recommendation I'd like to make, but I also would like some flexibility to listen to my fellow representatives.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I give huge credence to the air bag board who have gone through this, who, you know, really stop the train from going off the rails, brought it back, but also are mindful of the fact that if we just say no, we don't want it, we just want to keep things as they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Come July 1st, the planning grant disappears and they will be greatly disabled. So I. I believe that it is time to enter into a new model to have the option for this new regional agency and governance model. I also agree with the the former mayor and county supervisor who recommend that MTC be requested to rescind Resolution 4210'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to give time for both bodies to come to an agreement about the the governance model model moving forward. Otherwise, it's negotiation with a gun held to your head, you know, quick in less than six weeks, unwind one agency, create to figure out the governance models.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm hoping that this is something that others at the meeting on Thursday will agree with. Option four Request to rescind Resolution 4210. And then I have great respect for as rapporteur for the executive director. If on Thursday it looks like they can't get movement or they can't get the votes from the rest of the the board'",
        "'speaker_3': ', I suppose. Option seven could be considered and the difference is the the contract is entered into to consolidate staff functions. So rather than creating this new agency with maybe a different way, you know, model going forward. Basically it all goes over to MTC under their executive director.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I will also add that one of our constituents in Alameda is Randy Rentschler, program director at MTC four. He's been with him for 20 some years and he came to City Hall and met with the city manager and assistant city manager, Lismore, Madame and myself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you know, I understand Mtc's position, but they see it from their position as that metropolitan planning organization. I'm concerned about local control. I'm concerned that Alameda, as a mid-sized city, have a voice in issues in the region that affect us in the way we do business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Transportation is an important part of that, but it's not the only part. So anyway, those are those are my recommendations. I hope that was understandable. Thanks for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I would like to know if it's appropriate to divide that ask so that we have a vote first on option four and then have a second vote on what to do with option seven. Is that because that's my understanding division of question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's how I propose it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think you can do it that way. What I was hearing, the question is. Sort of flexible. Is there a support for option four and then flexibility depending on what happens at the meeting?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So I thought I'd like to start with or or we can discuss that. They were people are on that first part the first part of the ask and our discussion. Council members. So I. I personally am supportive of the comments of starting with option four, along with asking C to rescind Resolution 1442 ten and continuing to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'fund a bag until option for it can be fully implemented. But I do support that as our first. Position other council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice mayor in reading this mountain of. It's it's really almost like a schoolyard fight. That's been my understanding. It's mandated by the the Senate bill that has mandated this merger. And, I mean, that's one characterization of it. And.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It seems that. I would like to have more local control and I tend to look at a bag as the agency that better reflects local control because of the participation that is. Is his mandated by its organization. So I think option four and again, I think it buys time to help us understand what the next step is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and trying to discern whether it's better than option seven, I think is a difficult thing given the short amount of time that we've had to look at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other council members want to weigh in on this. Member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess I. There's voluminous material here. I mean, this one is a 99 page document.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there was the letters.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'SB SB 375 passed in 2008. So that was a while ago, eight years ago? Not not recently. I really like a little bit more input from staff if I realize there's a meeting next week or this week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, ideally I'd like to have staff evaluate this and come to a recommendation, but I don't know if there's time for that. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, can I just give a brief perspective on it? I think it did start with SB 375 because that created forced this marriage unwilling partners to come up with one one plan. Plan B area. And basically, there were there's two different interests, completely money based transportation projects.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What will get actually done in the region? And then more sort of outreach. Let's talk to the community. And I think each one were going in separate directions and then they'd meet and be off sync. And so then they had there was a lot of frustration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this frustration goes back to the last 55 years, actually, because about every ten years a bag in MTC has had an issue and has talked about merging. And this, I think, is the closest it's ever come. And part of the issue, the biggest issue is what to do with the governance structure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's two different. There is the MTC commission and there is the air bag board. Both have. Very legitimate, valid interests and roles, but they don't really mesh together. And so what option for does is it says, let's not have those two different governing boards and let's create a new one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What option seven does as it says initially, let's combine the staff under one executive director. And what the mayor and I heard at the mayor's conference was the expectation is that that executive director will be Steve Hemminger, the Executive Director of MTC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As opposed to AVA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Or as or someone else. Correct. Or a third unbiased right individual. So, so forcing those that staff to work together with different interests and the executive director continuing to report to two boards with different interests. And the reason that option seven is discussed is because it says that both agencies have to agree on one option and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'so a bag believes that MTC will not go. My time's up. A bag believes that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'MTC will not support a new governing structure. And so their compromise is option seven, which says two boards initially and then an option to study a full merger later on. So. I actually agree with where this council seems to be going is option for if possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But taking away the gun to your head on restricting the funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Vice Mayor And I think with that background, again, it buys us time to be able to. Give direction to our representatives in the eventuality that it goes to something like option seven. We really have to understand what we're getting with getting into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amber Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I was just going to say that, first of all, I do. And by the way, our city manager at one time worked for a bank. So she she knows quite well the inner workings of that agency and the relationship with MTC.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But one of the things that the management partners consultants study noted and somewhat ironically, their recommendation to consultants was option six, which neither Mtc's executive board or the board chose is an option. And even when they noted in that to execute a contract between MTC and a bank to consolidate planning functions within MTC and enter into an'",
        "'speaker_3': 'MRU to create new regional agency and governance model. But then quickly note that such an MRU may or may not be legally binding. So it really is a compromised position borne of reality. So I think if and I don't know how big and if it is, but if MTC could be persuaded to rescind the the resolution or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'amend that July 1st date to, you know, six months from now or whatever, it's this is a big step. As as Ms.. Chimique noted, these discussions have been broached before. This is the first time it's ever been so close to actually happening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So certainly if we take more than six weeks to figure out the details and possibly with a facilitated discussion, which is something that the consultant's report recommended, I think some progress may be made.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember they said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we seem to be talking about here is the difference between a merger and a takeover of two entities. I trust that our representative to a bag council member, Maryland, as you Ashcraft has been very involved in this issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so if you have a recommendation, one of her recommendations is to pursue option four then. And I think she's our duly appointed member involved in this, so I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like us to actually vote the way we do, give you that authority for that first vote, assuming that that's what the ask was. That's what I heard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's one of the. So I. Did you want to make a motion for that first part.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My speech?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Authorize our representative to represent the city in voting for option for us listed in this in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can I'm out a friendly amendment to also the second part here of asking MTC to rescind a yes 4210 and continue to fund a bag until option four can be fully implemented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So the motion, um, the one on second. I'll second all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'EPSTEIN. Sorry. Epstein So four in favor of that one abstention. So then you have authority for for that part of the ask. And then if I heard correctly, you want to do you want to explain the second part of what you were seeking?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I you know, while it might be nice to have our staff do research, a bag has been living with this for. A while now. And they have been at these executive level talks and they know their finances.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the fact that the back executive committee's second choice, follow up option, backup plan, they called it, is this option seven. If they can't buy additional time, it keeps a bag from essentially. Dissolving. I mean, if you don't have the funding, you can't it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Every year they go out to various. Funding grant organizations. And that's a tough way to keep your your funding stream. And they get some funding stream from MTC. But MTC is saying, look, I know you can't continue to be a financial drain on us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and MTC does have some some concerns. There's some labor issues that I felt was getting a little too much into the weeds. That's something that both boards can can get into. But if MTC really stands firm and refuses to rescind Resolution 4210, then I don't want to leave a bag in the vulnerable position of just.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just dissolving, I would rather see an orderly process. And so, you know, we know from being up here long enough, there are a few perfect solutions. Here's an example that I do give great credit credence to the folks who have been working hardest at this and would just like that as a backup plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a question and a point. If I understood correctly, if a bag dissolves, the name TK becomes the regional planning. Regional planning body.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think preserving local control is important.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was hard for me to accept option seven. I almost didn't want to leave it at the first one because I do feel that option seven and the rest of these actually look more like a hostile takeover. And that then it just I don't see I don't see I'm very concerned that we will, in fact, be losing'",
        "'speaker_0': '. If MTC is not in a position or willing to negotiate at this point and accept option four, I don't expect them to step up and give us any more protections or control. And I'm very concerned about losing our local control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm personally not. I have very serious concerns about agreeing to option seven. Yes, I by.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The process timing issue. The vote will happen on Thursday if. If our position is not. It doesn't prevail. Are they going to work it out during that Congress and have a second vote?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the way it works on Thursday, as I understand it, is first we have to see if we have a quorum and then we vote on whatever it is. I mean, a motion not dissimilar to what we're doing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There'll be a discussion and and I would expect that the number one recommendation, option four, is going to be up for a vote. And if that gets the majority vote, then that's what the MTA, the air bag executive board will take to their joint session with the a bag with the empty board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, I don't mean to diminish Alamitos significance in any way, but people, we are one out of 101 cities. So, I mean, but I, I take this seriously and I did read 99 pages of report to understand it in May or to your point about it seems more like a hostile takeover.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Trust me, some of the options are even more like a hostile takeover. And the do nothing let it go by default, I don't think is is a good option, just my personal view.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But is that going to be is there going to be a second vote on. On Thursday, or do we get another chance to come back and evaluate what happened? You can report what happened on Thursday and then we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can be more informed before we jump to another option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I don't know. I don't know that that's going to happen, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't know that what's going to happen. There's not another vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, this is no. Because. Okay, bear in mind that right now, the way Resolution 4210 reads, both boards have to come to an agreement by July 1st or else the funding for IBAC goes away. So there the clock is ticking unless they're persuaded to rescind those provisions in in resolution for issue ten.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for that reason, I don't think it's going to get bounced back again. Now, if there's not a quorum, the vote won't be taken. So, I mean, I don't know everything, but no, I don't expect this to come back to the city level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think. Well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The question I have is a quorum is established. There's a motion to go with option for second to everybody votes and it loses. Does that mean someone can make a motion at that meeting and say, okay, what's your choice?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. And I think that's part of the reason that as Rapaport and the executive board of a bag have that second fallback option. And again, I give them a lot of credence and respect in Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mayor I'd like to move. Council member as he asked Kraft's second option as our backup plan to support. You know, I think there's value in these two entities and I hope that they work it out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Secondly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions? Comments. All those in favor I oppose. I oppose. Abstain and one abstention. So three in favor. One oppose and one abstention.'",

    "Presentation on the Neighborhood Parking Permit Program.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Great. Well, thank you very much. The reason why I put together this referral was in light of our decision several weeks ago, about 1435 Webster Street. At which point in time a resident had indicated a desire for a parking permit program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Such a program does exist in the city of Alameda and has existed since, I believe, roughly 2011. And has been in existence since 2011. Now, I don't know if any parking program has actually been implemented, and I suspect none has.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I do recall during the course of the Del Monte project, so there was possible discussion of having a parking permit program around the Del Monte project. But for whatever reason, none such came to pass. I have heard indirectly that that the work required to ratchet up the support, especially from the area that the parking permit program'",
        "'speaker_7': 'has currently devised, is it requires a lot. At a minimum. For example, the parking permit area has to encompass six contiguous blocks and to get a consensus on that might be a one of the stifling factors to the creation of a parking permit program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So one of the things I'd like to do is just have a presentation on the parking permit program so that in hopes of actually of preparing a program involving the different facets of of our of our city hall that's involved in the parking permit program so that people, residents on the night of the presentation as well as'",
        "'speaker_7': 'as on a permanent basis, perhaps some kind of saved video, kind of can see the way in which the parking permit program works, how people access the different rules that have enabled it. So that's one thing. It's kind of informing the residents about its availability.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two is looking at where we can make things perhaps easier for residents to implement such a program. And let me give you a specific example. Recognizing that a parking permit program requires and ought to include at least six contiguous blocks, we might think about having even more scaled down parking permit program because it's altogether possible that for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the project that we had discussed two weeks ago, 1435, a program, all that's needed is just for the 600 block of Taylor Avenue and the 700 block of Taylor Avenue, which stretches from St Barnabas all the way down to Webster Street and from Webster Street all the way down to Washington School.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's not a Washington school anymore. Myelin. So that. And what part of the discussion is in limiting a parking permit program, making it even possible to have it even scaled down to this level and making it easier for residents to have such a scaled down parking permit program.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Part of the discussion. My hope is to see if the costs involved with that are already embedded in services that are right now delivered anyways. So that a scaled down parking permit program. As as a separate parking permit program from the one that's in books right now or maybe as a replacement, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that as so that a scaled down parking permit program does, it won't necessarily represent a substantial incremental increase in service outlays. For this reason, you have a traffic person going up and down what street? I don't know, maybe twice a day anyways.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for them to go down one block to the left of Taylor and one block to the right of Taylor at the Taylor. And what Webster seems to me does not represent an incremental a substantial incremental increase in outlays.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It may or may not. I don't know. But that's that's something to to be discussed and for staff to take a look at. So just to summarize, one is I think the city manager and her staff put together a presentation, hopefully very well prepared, so that it could be kind of posted on our website somewhere so that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the value in and of itself that it's there to is to have a discussion, to see if it's possible to have fiscally possible, to have an operationally possible to have a scaled down parking permit program. So as to deal with what I believe to be one of the fetters to implementing such a thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That being the sixth contiguous block requirement. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And we do have one speaker on this item. I'm going to go ahead and call her at this point. Eleanor, I'll pretend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am Eleanor Albertsen, and this is my first time at a city council meeting. So anything that I hear parking my ears perk up, people. I live in Bayport and people don't even know what Bayport is. Bayport, if you by chance don't know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it was the first area from the Navy base that became a development. I mean, people think I'm talking about Bay Forum when I say Bayport and it's on the West End near the City College of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I've lived there for four years and for the past two years I have been the chair of the parking committee of the HRA. It's a voluntary position, you know, you see, I'm spending like over 2 hours of my time here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Over the past two years, I've spent much time on this because what's happening is with all this new development that's going on. Things get really complicated when it comes to parking and it's so bad for some people in Bayport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Seriously, I mean, it it's some streets are so bad that people have actually moved out of the community. Some houses have turned over quite a few times. I'm the third or third owner of my home and the house is only like 11 years old.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think what created the problem is the whole idea that it's complicated because your city streets and private streets. And I think the I'm just putting this out there to you as people of importance in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know who. Who are responsible for new housing and things like that, that you have to really consider people's needs. And people do use cars. I mean, I ride my bike, but I also do need a car. And when I have company, I really have such anxiety as to whether they're going to have a parking spot or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not. Because when you're on a private street, only owners and guests of owners are supposed to park there. But that's not the reality. The reality is we have people parking in all sorts of vehicles like trucks and people living in their vehicles on the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We get all the people from across Ralph Esposito who can't find parking there in their Section eight housing or their apartments, and they park on the street and there's really no way to enforce it. So anyway, so I came out with a lot of other people to do this parking proposal, and we did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We came further than anybody else. I believe in the I don't know, maybe the 11 years that they ports existed. And we have a very solid proposal that because everybody has a different situation, it's very hard to get a consensus.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. I want to support any type of permit parking because that has come up as an option in our neighborhood, too. And it's very, very difficult to reinvent the wheel. I mean, I'm from the health field. What do I know about parking?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I had to do a lot of learning and I've lost a lot of sleep over this. So please consider having some kind of parking permit proposal out there so we can use it to in Bayport. And if anybody has any suggestions or any direction for me, I greatly appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I talked to Tony a few times about this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. I appreciate that. All right, counsel, comments, questions. She was our only speaker on that item. And vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's a great idea. It's 2011 listen and if the depth of the depression from the city side and. We have had point after point on parking coming up so I'd like to move that we erect for the the council referral to direct the city manager to put together an updated presentation on neighborhood parking permit program'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ashcroft Thank you so. I mean, I think this is something to look into. It certainly came up in the context of 1435 Webster. I think staff, I believe Jennifer and Liam Garland have been having some meetings. I mean, I know they have have been meeting with folks from the Arab neighborhoods that are impacted by overflow parking for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the ferry there. So I imagine staff is already looking into this. You know, go forth and do good work. But I would also just add is that obviously money doesn't grow on trees. We had some pretty sobering comments earlier in this meeting about the need to do to address some of our traffic concerns that could lead to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'personal injury. We had a very unfortunate fatality recently if we had to decide and maybe these are completely different pots of money. But if we had to decide between.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'More.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Enforcement, traffic enforcement on the streets to keep our pedestrians and cyclists and motorists safe, you know, that that would, in my mind, be a priority. Maybe we can do it all, but it's not easy. And I do. Commander.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Speaker four The effort you're doing in your homeowners association volunteers rock. But anyway, so I'm not I mean, I think it's a, it's a timely topic, but just to to see, you know, where it fits into our budgetary constraints.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, Odie?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll second the motion that the Vice Mayor made. I think this is a very timely referral. I mean, when you brought this up, when we had the discussion on the motion to approve the 1435 project, know I committed to supporting this if you would bring this forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm not going to change that commitment. But, you know, we've this is this is our responsibility to tackle. And we've heard the problems with the Del Monte and the issues with the parking there. You know, we've heard the issues on Bay Farm with the ferry when I served on the homeowners board, on when I lived on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bay Farm, and that was our biggest issue. I think that's probably the biggest concern people have out on Bay Farm is people parking in front of their houses. But, you know, it took us a while to actually, you know, decide to go forward and put in a parking program and starting to tell people when they shouldn't be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there. So it's kind of a big step. I understand there might be a little reluctance, but, you know, we have a program out there and I believe from the comments that we heard last meeting, that the program is supposed to generate enough revenue to support itself with with tickets and permits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm not sure that's going to be a problem if we design it. Right. But maybe there's a way that we can fix it or adjust it, you know, for like the council member district said on on Taylor, but not too many of us were aware of this program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the more education that we can do, you know, the better it is for me. So I'm planning on being supportive of this. And thank you for bringing this forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I have I have questions because it's my understanding staff is currently working with the homeowners associations at the ferry on a proposal that would go to them. And in regards to what just happened on Taylor, that would be, I think, a different scenario.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the ask here, I'm not sure. I actually think it may be better to address these different neighborhoods in different as different items. And I and and if in fact people on Taylor have are interested in the program, then I think it would be appropriate if there is a barrier to the current system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But then it could come to council to read to to see if there's a problem. If people are, you know, then we could modify the program. But I'm not sure that this is the best use of staff's time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'd be interested in hearing from our city manager because I know that they are. In fact, I'm sure we all know working closely with the homeowners associations by the ferry on the farm. And that to me is a and in regards to prioritizing how we're going to be spending staff's time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My preference would be that we address real problems. If people on Taylor have an issue, then we should be looking at that. The people they form. I know we are currently working on that and the people I can report whatever that issue is, but I don't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that they actually are very distinct issues for each one and would and this ask I'm not sure that this is really the best use of staff's time in addressing the real problems in certain. Neighborhoods. My son, I'd like to hear about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My senses just quickly that they are actually very similar problems in that what we're dealing with in both situation is the overflow of parking as a result of some kind of transportation network, whether it's the ferry system in the at the Harbor Bay or whether it's the carpool system for which there is a city side that encourages'",
        "'speaker_7': 'carpooling right there. So it's a city that's promoting, carpooling and and the bus system. So those people parking their cars there and leaving it all day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So I'd like to hear from staff. I actually think they both are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. There's lot staff, though. Liam, the police chief, are here if we have any specific questions, because they have been meeting on a regular basis, both internally with a bunch of different departments and with the Harbor Bay groups and Harbor Bay and Bay Port have similar issues that might be resolved with some proposed language changes to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, it would be lovely if we did have a yes update from both Mr. Garland and SCHIEFFER, Larry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'd like to let the city manager finish her comments and then introduce them to her.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think the issue is, although they're similar, when we look at how best to implement them, it may be like in Harbor Bay, if if it's a very small area, then people are willing to walk farther and it just impacts the next adjacent block.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think we have to look at it pretty much at a case by case basis of how far someone's willing to walk. So we don't keep impacting the next neighborhood. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so would you like to give us some insight as to what this should look like? Do you want to hear from them first?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, let's hear from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Observer, Larry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Chief just got.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Demoted. Very cheap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ouch. That's right. That was really quick. No, sir. Would you like to speak to Chief Ledbetter? So there's a lot of sort of. Floating balloons with this concept and we're still we have been meeting with the Harbor Bay is about working out a residential permit program there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are there are some distinct differences but like member dislike said, the the main issue the one that's going to be common in any of these proposals is the overflow that's impacting the residents who have homes who can't park or have their guests over.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that in mind, fiscally, it's not going to cost us. We're not going to I don't see the police department having to make a choice between the traffic enforcement that was brought up earlier and enforcing a residential parking permit program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have most of our parking citations in town. Most of them are issued by our part time parking tax. We're down one position. There may be two. They're not. Although I have my staffing issues with the with the police officer rank these the part time parking positions are not really difficult to to fill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member days I've mentioned you know the the regular routes that they run to do the meter enforcements and you're correct it wouldn't be a big deal it wouldn't add any additional cost to the department to have them come through another time or two on six or the 700 block of Taylor or out at Harbor Vale.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the public and private streets to do the extra enforcement where we're not talking about all day, we're talking about the beginning of the day and the end of the day. So it's really kind of already baked in to our costs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do. I would have some concerns further down the road if this becomes popular and it takes off. And we've got 15 neighborhood parking permits going on and we've got different areas to enforce. Then I might come back and say, okay, I've got a problem, I need more people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or This is this is now starting to be a problem. But if we're talking about Bayport Harbor Bay and the six or 700 block of Taylor or some other nearby neighborhood to the Webster Street corridor, we can handle it with what we have right now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Liam Garland from.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Public Works, which won out a couple of things to that, which is we will be back in front of this body on June 7th with some proposed changes to the residential permit parking program for four ways specifically. And that has to do with a proposed solution for the Harbor Bay Ferry terminal might relate to Bayport.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's something we should definitely be in contact about. The other thing to consider is you've got a citywide transportation study and parking is an element of that as to whether proposed changes to the parking program are worthy of analysis.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It seems like that's the vehicle to address that because as if there's more of these permit programs citywide, that's citywide effect. That's something that can be considered through the course of that study.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let it be. I wanted to hear from staff or city manager regards you. So when you look at this proposal, is this the best way for us to address these issues or. Well, it sounds like some of them will be coming up to us through work that staff is already doing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or would you recommend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ideally we could bring this back June 7th with the first set of changes. We can see how that works here. Continue to hear from the community, have it included in the citywide transportation plan and that's coming now. Fairly soon, too.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in part of that process, we're meeting with residents and we can figure out more specifically what it is under the current program. And we can also encourage residents to, if they have an issue, they can start talking to staff now on what it would look like and what the barriers are so we can sort of learn'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Under our existing program because any resident can apply for it. Now, any group of blocks of residents can apply for it now, and so once they start learning about it, then we can find out specifically what the issues are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think the motion in the second can still stand because you've outlined that there's already work being done, and I think the timing is actually good because the points that are in here can be can leverage the work that's been done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this can come back in the context of those are the public works report that's already coming back and the transportation master plan but that that work that's being done. So I think if we go forward with this, it takes these elements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the scale scaling element, the financing element and that that impact that's talked about where where the problem is being pushed. I think are specified in this referral. And those now I'd like to see highlighted as we go through this process, both with my own bay and what's going on with our overall transportation demand management program'",
        "'speaker_7': '. I only can. My only concern that I would raise, though, is that the citywide transportation plan that we're putting together is I think we're like three months into an 18 month process. So. So that would be that would be a concern.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'By the same token, I don't I mean, the work that's being done in terms of the H-2A, it seems as though there's been good forward progress on that. So I think that should move along. So, you know, with regard to some of the issues that are raised tonight, particularly the is it possible to scale it down and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'how do we deal with what are the secondary policies we need to think about should in scaling it down, if others then begin to like begin I mean, what are our countermeasures? I mean, those are things that I'm looking to staff to think about and then and and come back.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it doesn't have to be in June, but I really encourage us to not wait 18 months, though.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would like to have some input from the community if if if people on Taylor are looking at this, I think it's important we hear from them. That's a concern of mine if we're driving it and we haven't heard from them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now we do have someone here from Bayport. But to me that is telling us that there's a neighborhood there that staff could very well be meeting with and making sure that we are meeting their demands and seeing if, in fact, our current policies already meet their demands and that we just need to have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft That's your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think there's more. Manager.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was just going to make the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That as part of what Councilmember de Saag was asking for is that when we come back on June 7th, that we can actually do a presentation on the ordinance, not just what our changes are, but so that it's a presentation and this is what we currently have on the books.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's sort of like a tutorial 101. And, you know, and at that time, I think Mayport and Harbor Bay and we will have some of the Harbor Bay changes. But I think that also might help address what Councilmember Desai was looking for.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let me just make sure to say Taylor Avenue was raised only as illustrative purposes, largely because it was a project that it occurred and that there was a resident who did speak for that. But the larger point about Taylor is that is this is that we have these business districts part Street or Webster Street, and you have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'you have police going down there, traffic, traffic people going down them and doing their their stuff. So in the regular course of doing their stuff, they're there anyways. It's not necessarily a significant incremental increase in in outlays that's required for them now to go to one or two blocks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, as Chief Larry said, yes, but if you have success with one or two blocks, you know, it might spur ten others in the area. But my response to that is. Or staff then to kind of contemplate what our our countermeasures in dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Remember, I just wanted to add real quick, I think the assistant city manager said what I was going to say. I mean, I think the important part of this that's common to all the neighborhoods is that there's a plan out there, a program, and that we need to educate the public on what it is and how we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can go about setting it up, and then we go from there. So with that, I'll call the question and list the other question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, so we have a motion and a second. All those in favor, I. Oppose. I'm going to oppose a motion carries for two one. Thank you. Next item is nine d.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Consider reforming the Council of Council Review Process of Planning Board decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this was a member of his referral.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or my comments to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So well, then, do you want to speak to what we're going to describe what the referral is, or should I ask the court to? Well, we have an audience of watching here. All right. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, has it pulled up? A brief description. The review process for planning board decisions calls for review on important check and balance in the city process. Ensure that a majority of elected council have the ability to ensure that the work generated by the Planning Board and other bodies rise to the expected quality and appropriateness.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it goes through and makes a proposal on reforming it. It doesn't take any authority away from the council members. Council members could still weigh in under this proposal. They can even weigh in earlier and probably have a chance to convince others earlier to of the validity of their their concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's just an idea that we have maybe a more nuanced review that would ensure that all projects go through a full vetting before being brought to the Council for a rehearing, and that a review actually has the likelihood of actually being overturned if brought to the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, for example, I'm not comparing us to the Supreme Court, but, you know, if you want to bring a case to the Supreme Court, you need four of the nine judges to say, I want to hear that case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, it might be worthwhile to consider, you know, perhaps two or three individual on this council. It would have to raise a concern because there are issues that we may want to hear that we may not vote against later on, but we want to give them an opportunity to have an hearing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there may be situations where we do want to have a hearing or the other way around. So I want to hear the public comment and I have some remarks and then I'm happy to hear colleagues input. But the one thing this is not the end all be all.'"
