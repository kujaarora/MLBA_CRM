        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And could I just. Yes. And also, I think that so for those who are watching who might not be clear about this, these are two pieces of state legislation, Assembly Bill 35 and Assembly Bill one three, three five.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the 1335 was more controversial to realtors because it would impose a $75 transaction fee on some real estate transactions, but not the purchase of a home or commercial property, but that the fund that that would create would provide funding for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I especially want to commend not only our local realtors, but also the state association, because they were not always behind this. And it's that's really strong support when the realtors of this state come out and acknowledge the need for more affordable housing, but more importantly, the funding mechanism for affordable housing, because we can all say'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we want more affordable housing, but you've got to find the funds to do that. And so this is a very important step to take for our city to get behind this. So thank you all the realtors. We have a.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'If it interferes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With traffic at the crossings.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With signal priority, for example, it will increase congestion without saving any significant time. The dedicated lanes result in a loss of traffic lanes, of course, and the standard fix is to remove the parking along the street, which would be a disaster here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In fact, Berkeley turned down the proposed BRT system for precisely the reason because it would harm businesses, among other things. They went instead with the obvious alternative to the elaborate BRT bus, a simple express bus with limited stops which runs efficiently without causing massive disruption.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've also heard that the Fruitvale Bridge might be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rebuilt to accommodate a BRT system. Let me point out the obvious. So once you cross the bridge, you're in Oakland and there's only three lanes. Not to mention a freeway underpass. I have no faith in this planning process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's cookie cutter planning, which is liable to do a great deal more harm than good here. And I'm tired of being dictated to by regional agencies. Let me suggest very strongly that with this and anything else that might seriously affect traffic, that the city run articles in the newspaper informing the public of the plans and'",

        "'speaker_1': 'It's 800 units at Alameda Point versus the versus 30,000 units and the rest of the island. We need an absolute commitment that nothing about the transit planning and I don't mean to point would cause any predictable or preventable delays to traffic at the tubes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would like to see the site atrium plan amended to spell that out. I would also like to see an article in the paper spelling out what the points BRT system would look like. It's not at all clear in the term plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm aware of all the hearings. I'm also aware that most people have no idea what a BRT system is. Frankly, I think we're entitled to the same level of discussion here that occurred in our neighboring cities, and it hasn't happened.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I'll move approval of the item a second.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And so if we get the Tiger grant there, and that's two and that is two through the tubes. Okay. Yep, yep. So up our up Ralph out, you know, up ramp, left turn. And then we now have a clear transit lane.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you've been out there from Atlantic all the way through the tubes or not all the way through the tubes that are up to the tubes for the busses. And so the plan is, is to bring people up quickly on ramp, make that left turn and get them through the tube.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'be approved, and the and the land use regulation that is at play here is our design review ordinance, but we are also governed by federal regulations dealing with these types of facilities. And what the federal regulations basically say is that in our review of these applications, we cannot base our decisions on issues related to the potential health'",
        "'speaker_8': 'effects of RF emissions, essentially that we cannot discriminate between divider providers. So if there's, you know, Sprint has a facility on the roof for the building, we can't say, oh, AT&T, you can't have one that we cannot use our regulations to essentially prohibit services to certain areas, certain neighborhoods, if a coverage gap exists.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then particularly this last issue and this really plays into Saint Charles Street, where there's already a cell phone antenna on the roof of Saint Charles for another provider, and that's called co-location, where it's where the provider says, oh, look, I want to just go on the same roof as the other provider.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have almost no discretion to say to say no. Under federal law. Federal law also establishes what they call the shot clock. It's a basically a time limit for cities to take action. It's shorter for co-location facilities. So ST, the St Charles facility has 90 days to take action.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are because of the all the calls for review, we are very quickly hitting the end of our 90 day period. We have a little bit more time on Shoreline. But frankly, from staff's perspective, the issue here is not so much these federal deadlines for action.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's that September deadline when those neighborhoods go dark.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe if I move. If you could go back the 150 days on the shoreline property, you know what that day is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, that takes us to about mid-June. Thank you. You know, the issue there is if we hold our decision until mid-June, then they still need to build the new facilities. So we question is, depending on where the new facility ends up being, will they have time to build a new facility and get it online in time to'",
        "'speaker_8': '. Before the September deadline for getting the old facility shut down.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what federal law does say is essentially you can use your design review process when looking at the city of Alameda. You can focus your discretion on the appearance of the structures and the physical placement of the facility.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's essentially what we do in design review. We use the design review ordinance for everything from the review of these wireless facilities to second story additions to, you know, the new Walgreens on Park Street. That's all the same regulatory structure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And these are the findings for two approved design reviews that the design is consistent with the general plan zoning and design review manual, that the project is compatible and harmonious with the design and use of the surrounding area, and that the proposed design of the structure and existing materials are visually compatible with the surrounding development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So those are the basic findings. If the answer is yes to everything, then presumably the answer is yes to the application of the answer is no to any one of those questions, and presumably the answer is no. So here's some examples we have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As I said, we have these facilities all over town. They've been through various design review. Applications over the years. These are three examples of facilities on the roofs of existing residential buildings. You can see they are we pointed them out with the arrows.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In some cases we tried to. In many cases we tried to screen them, you know, hide them. Like you can see that the big building on the left with the fake little arches. It was really designed. I mean, that's essentially that structure is for one purpose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's screening a set of antennas. And then you see these other are some of the other ones less ornate on the right. We also have some like the corner of Santa Clara and Park over here, the big tall building that's called the Oddfellows Building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that the name of it on the corner? If you look up there, we've there the the the antennas are unscreened. And in that case, it felt like putting a box on top of a boxy building. It just looked bad.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So in that case, the decision was to to keep them without the screening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the one on the left, the shoreline property or. No, no, no.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So these are just examples around town, right? This is shoreline. So existing photo, if you go out there today and stand in the parking lot on the left, existing elevator housing, you see a little arrow pointing down. There is an elevator in that building and it creates this little box on the roof.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what AT&T is proposing is, well, let's just make that box a little bit bigger. So you see the drawing on the right. That's a simulation of what it will look like in the future. So that the idea was, let's just make that box a little bigger and it'll house the elevator housing and the antennas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that is the design review application. We determined that it was consistent with the zoning and general plan, that it was compatible with the design and architecture of the building and that it should be approved. So we approved that design review application and the planning board concurred and also approved it with some additional conditions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The height, the same is wider. What's the difference?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's a it's a bill. It's a little higher. Um. I can give you the exact date on that. The screening structure will extend 11 feet from the top of the roof to a height of 38 feet and six inches.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What is it currently?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I that I do not have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May I ask?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Probably the typical elevator thing is probably around 9 to 10 feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, Mr. Thomas, with the proposed extension in height and length, would that still be within the city's height limit for this particular area?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city's height limit actually provides a very large exception for antennas. Yeah. So you can actually go 25 feet above the height limit for the antennas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And it's not 25 feet, obviously. No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. So what is the and if if we didn't extend the box, do you know how what the antenna would look like? Is it possible to do it without extending the box? Just having the antenna.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, just have the antennas adjacent. AT&T would like can follow, would like to follow was also present some of this and maybe they can oh some ideas with their slides what what these antennas look like they're not in a box.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's just go to the next I've got two more quick slides and then I can sit down and let AT&T answer some of these questions. So here's Saint Charles. Apartment building on the left and what it looks like today with the existing roofline.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You can see there's already a little you can barely see it there with the lights on. But there's a there's already a screening, an antenna on the roof. So this is the co-location one. So you see some things sticking up on the roof there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's another provider with a screened in antenna. And then the AT&T facility would be set further back on the roof. And you can see the arrow. You can barely see the little box sticking up over the edge of the parapet there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So once again, this is the other reason why we felt the design review application could be approved. We approved it. In the end, the planning board upheld that decision. So our recommendation is that you uphold the Planning Board's approval of both of these applications at both Shoreline Drive and St Charles Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also just one more slide. We also this whole experience over the last three meetings has really made us talk sort of internally and with the neighbors and with the providers that we need. Well, we have very little control.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have very little discretion over these, but we need to have a better process. This has not been a very satisfactory process or experience for anyone. It's been frustrating for the neighbors. It's been frustrating for the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They sat through a big, long hearing and then felt like, well, there's nothing they really could do about it, and that the real issues were being, you know, just weren't available to be discussed. So some of the quick ideas that we have been talking about doing and that we've been talking about this for a while, actually is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'trying to work with not only the city, the new city council, but the other agencies around the city who own property. You know, the park district, the the the Navy, the, you know, even the school district might have some sites like Thompson Field and create a citywide list of preferred sites so that when we were that and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'for those agencies who want to put properties on the list, it's an opportunity for revenue, of course, as well. But if they if the providers want to use their their land for these facilities. So the idea would be create a list of preferred sites and that would be the first choice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So providers, when they said, hey, we're trying to fill a gap, we would say, well, we want you to go to one of our preferred sites. It may be a city site, it might be a school district site, it might be a park district site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Who knows? But basically, it would be our way as working as a community to identify where we would prefer these things to go. And then we would establish sort of standard procedures, conditions for that for those sites. We could work with the various agencies on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And hopefully essentially also the third piece would be creating some sort of an expedited process for the approval of those on those sites. Now, if, of course, this does not make these other applications necessarily go away in the future, a provider might look at those lists and say, it just doesn't fill our gap.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It doesn't work, in which case then we'll have to entertain other sites because under federal law, we have to allow them to fill a gap. But the idea of this process would be two things. One, if we as a community can identify preferred sites, that would be great because as many of these future facilities that we can'",
        "'speaker_8': 'direct to those sites, so much the better. The other piece is the sort of the expedited review. What was very frustrating about this is we send out notices to neighbors like our typical notice, hey, we're we got an application we're considering.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It sort of implies that you can have some input and shape the project on these situations with all the FCC regulations. What's happening is we're sending out notices and then we're basically telling people, Yeah, but you actually have no say in this process at all because the FCC says this and this and this and this and this'",
        "'speaker_8': ', and there's very little discretion. So I think part of our idea on this is that we really do need to think about if we can get providers to go to preferred sites, it would be nice to have an expedited process where we get those approved rather than sending out notices telling people you can have input and then'",
        "'speaker_8': 'really not give them a whole lot of input. So that's just something we've been thinking about. If the council wants to direct us sort of down that path, that's certainly something we would support. And with that, I am available to answer questions for Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I have one. Do you want to tell us a little bit about a meeting that was held last week with them?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. We met briefly with a representative of Congresswoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Barbara Lee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Barbara Lee's office, who is here meeting with constituents. And we invited a couple of the residents who have been active, Ms.. Jessica Reed, who I think is yes, I know she's here tonight and will be speaking. And another neighbor, unfortunately, was on fairly short notice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So there wasn't a lot of time. But it was helpful to be able to talk through these issues with both the OH and AT&T team as well. So it was it was helpful to talk through not only this idea, but just some of the pros and cons and frustrations that we all have with the sort of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'situation. On one hand, we're all using cell phones, so we all kind of get it. We need cell phones, but we'd like to have a little bit more control over where these things go and how we place them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so it was it was helpful to talk that through with the with both the residents and AT&T. AT&T was very encouraging to us about this kind of process. If we as a community can can pull together and do that because they think not just AT&T, but the other providers as all as well, would be very interested'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in. Working through this kind of process with us. They are doing it with other communities. You know, we're not the only community struggling with these kinds of issues. So they offered their help and encouragement to sort of proceed along these lines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember, they suck.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'While the equipment that we're discussing tonight is AT&T. Is it correct to say that cell phone users generally will benefit not just people who have phones that are AT&T?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, I'm not an expert on that. But can I hold can we hold that question for the experts? AT&T, you actually would like to continue this presentation with some of their information. This is a field that it's a little technical, and I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Frankly, for other member questions at this point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Any more questions for me? I'll be available to answer any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More later on in regards to. So we had received a correspondence suggesting that we consider not not allowing, I think, the box so that the skyline would not be disrupted. Is that something that counsel can say that we don't want.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Box out of?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely. You know, it's an interesting question. We've debated that for a number of different sites and projects around the city over the years. There's sort of an ongoing debate just downstairs among the planners, like, you know. What looks worse, the actual antenna, which is an antenna or the box that we're putting around it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In some cases on historic buildings, we've always pushed for the box and we've tried to put a lot of ornamentation on it. In other cases, we've sort of leaned away from that. Obviously what we're talking about tonight are facilities sitting on roofs on existing buildings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also approve, you know, the freestanding poles. We have some would allow me to point there's one going in a yacht club. Typically, we don't try to screen those, although there is one recently going in that was approved by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll have our first fake tree in town. It's going to be at the Alien Yacht Club. It's basically a cell phone tower. It's a council tonight. Says we don't want the the a box. Just put the antennas. That's certainly within your discretion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we say is the one property and not estate, or do they both have boxes or only one of them?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are proposing boxes on both. You could do both. None. One. You know, it's that's they do have some discretion. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also at the planning board, I think that when when one of these projects is approved, they this one of them, they said they wanted notices given to residents. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let me if you'd like. I just the planning board added a couple conditions to our conditions. One was that the because this permit is going to AT&T and the owner of the property, the permit actually goes with the property, as with all of our design review.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But when you sell your property, the city approval stays with the property. You don't take it with you. They said, look, the one requirement, the property owner and AT&T must notify everybody in the building about what's going on the roof.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just basic disclosure. If somebody doesn't want to live in a building with those things on the roof, they should at least know what's up there. The other thing was that there are limitations in terms of for workmen and people like that up on the roof around this facility that do it, certain types of maintenance, the facility should'",
        "'speaker_8': 'be turned off. So there was just some basic safety information that they they imposed, which we think we're going to use now as standard conditions on all such facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Two points. The idea about noticing the residents, I think is a good idea. Perhaps we should make that a regular policy or a city across. The second issue is so there's already one next door. So why why on on the Shoreline Avenue?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if there's already one on the roof of next door, why aren't they co-locating there and pointing at it in whatever direction?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If it's okay with you? I mean, I. Push that question to the to AT&T. They do a what they call alternative site selection so that they can talk a little bit about what worked and what didn't work for those facilities in high school.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If that's okay with you. So if it's all right with the council, can I invite AT&T to sort of finish the presentation? Good evening, Mr. Spencer and members of Council appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My name is Ken Mintz. I'm the area manager of external affairs here in the East Bay for eternity. I have some prepared remarks. I'm going to go through them quickly. I don't want to repeat too much of what staff has already brought forward, but I want to put in some context about the process that we go through'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to help your understanding. And finally, I'd like to then invite up a third party engineer that we utilize for our emissions studies, which I think is also central to a lot of questions have been coming to us from the community as stated by staff, the applications before the Council or due to the loss of long term leases'",
        "'speaker_8': 'at two school sites within the city. Normally applications are brought forward as gaps in wireless coverage are identified. In the case of these applications, however, we are under extreme pressure to fill gaps that will exist once AT&T can no longer depend upon the existing antennas at the mile in Inwood schools.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The school board has terminated our leases these sites and identified late September as the termination date for both leases. As the Council is well aware, that demand for wireless services has been growing in an extraordinary pace. The school sites have been in place for more than ten years each.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'During that time, many people have come to depend on services in their homes as they've discontinued the use of landline phones and now expect the same level of reliability when needing to communicate through wireless devices. This is especially true for many lower income households who gave up landlines to increase their disposable income, as well as millennials who'",
        "'speaker_8': 'never had landlines in the first place. You may know some 20 year olds like that also across the United States. Approximately 44% of households have given up traditional landline service and now depend entirely on wireless service. Any loss of service for even a short period of time could affect public safety, as well as all the other ways'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that households now utilize our network, including children's education, home businesses, entertainment, etc.. Let me take a moment to explain how we identified the locations for the internment applications. When we identify a gap in coverage, our engineers identify a search area within which they look for potential candidate sites.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These must meet certain requirements. First, they must be able to fill the identified gap. This is dependent on the topography of the sites and by topography, it's not just hills. We don't have a whole lot of that here on the island.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'However, foliage can have an impact. Size of buildings around the antenna sites can have an impact. The number of antennas underneath and also the height of the antennas are another couple of requirements that we need to look at.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Second, the site must be constructed all and have sufficient space not only for the intended structure, but the associated equipment that needs to be placed in the same general vicinity by construct ability. There are a number of sites that we looked at that have heavily sloped roofs, for instance, very hard to place equipment on those type of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'facilities. Third, we also need a willing landlord. The two school sites met all of these criteria for many years until the school district decided it not wanted antennas on their properties and thereby no longer being liveaboard. Our search of the two neighborhoods resulted in examining quite a number of possible locations.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ultimately, we were looking for the least intrusive means for filling the coverage gap, and that is something that's directed to us by the FCC, at least intrusive means for filling a significant gap in coverage. We also consider properties that already contain one or more cell providers in order to co-locate at the same location where another wireless carrier'",
        "'speaker_8': 'already has facilities. Keep in mind, however, that a site may that may work for one provider does not necessarily work for another, given where each provider's other antennas are that say they create honeycombs and each honeycomb is different for each of the providers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You go to that next slide. This shows the area around our proposed site on St Charles Street. The yellow pushpins are a number of the alternative sites that we looked at. If you notice all of those, there are commercial sites.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When we talk about the preference list that we currently go through, we look for there are things like public properties, city owned properties, school district churches, that type of thing. We also look for commercial sites and co-location of existing antennas that we could also utilize.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So sites. A number of sites were rejected due to the lack of suitable space since many of the surrounding locations, particularly around 1530 in Charles, were too low to meet the coverage gap. We particularly looked at a mastic senior center which sits adjacent to the 1538 property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To build on that site would have required erecting an antenna over 60 feet in height, as well as taking up at least three parking spaces for the ground based equipment. If we switch to the next slide, I think you've seen this one.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is the roof of 1538 St Charles. On the other hand, three storey apartment building that already houses T-Mobile antennas and has sufficient space for the ground equipment as well, actually in the garage unit. Our plan calls for stealth in our antennas.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's some discussion of that with the staff to minimize the visual impact. Again, to create the least intrusive means, go quickly to the next one. You've seen these.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Things. You move on when you look at the stealth and yeah, do you know how much higher or wider this box will be than what's currently there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, let me pull it up. I can. Okay. So the existing height of the top of the penthouse is 47 feet ten inches, and the top of the antenna enclosure would be 50 feet, three inches. So about less than three additional feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's currently 47 feet high.'",
        "'speaker_8': '47, 47 feet ten inches high.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it would be expanded to 50 feet, three inches. So two and three inches, two and a half feet higher, wider than the existing, because we would be placing the antennas inside that enclosure, enclosing it of making it the same color and feel of the building itself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it would blend in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And do you know how much wider it will be with the current with this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In terms of. Width of the enclosure. That was in the report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is not an exhibit 315 feet by 14 feet, six inches by ten feet tall.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that the current?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's this. From what I understand, not speaking as an expert, that's the approved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. Right now there is no box on top.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No box at all. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm sorry. I'm thinking of the other side. Appreciate that. On this one, there is another structure which is the team mobile antenna site closer to the front of the building. When you look at that picture, you can actually see and that one T mobile did not enclosed area tenants they sit around the box and you can'",
        "'speaker_8': 'actually see their antennas hanging off the side of box. Our enclosure would have the antennas inside and then they would be surrounded by by that enclosure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So do you have pictures of what it currently is that shows what the antenna looks like and what the proposed will look like if we don't have a box?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And can I just interject that I know that this this item was brought to our attention by some of our residents, and I believe at least one of them is going to speak maybe more. I'm also under the impression that the Saint Charles location actually is not the controversial one because it's not in proximity to the school'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the park. So I just for the sake of time, because I know, Mayor, you want to move this along because of the length of the agenda. I just thought I'd point that out. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It sits about three blocks away from the Maitland School.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's currently not a box near proposing adding a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Box, adding a box to a co-location site, which under the FCC is. Almost a done deal type of situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just. You've seen the propagation maps or flipped through those. The application for 1777 Shoreline Drive will replace the antennas currently situated at Woods School. How we cover the gap in service that will exist with the loss of the Woods site is very important in that leaving gaps in coverage will mean a loss of service area residents'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in reviewing potential sites and buildings in the neighborhood. We found several that would be much more visible and thus more intrusive, such as if we were to erect a freestanding pole at Riddler Park, for instance, on the other side of the school.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a view of, again, the alternative site analysis that we did. You'll note that we looked as far to the east as the shopping center, as far to the north, I'm sorry, west their shoreline court. These sites, unfortunately, do not provide that level of coverage within the needed area, which means that residents with no longer have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'service who have it today. If we were to construct that those sites. As you get closer to the school site, that's where we start looking at other factors. So for instance, there were three well, there are other three story buildings in the vicinity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The placement of certain roofs creates what's known as a shadowing effect, which means that a higher antenna would be needed to get the same level of coverage. So if we were to move to one of the other buildings that sit and place it closer to Shoreline Drive, for instance, it would have to be a much larger intended'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to get that same level of coverage and not lose service for some of your residents. This is also an area that's very land constrained, as much of the available open ground space is devoted to parking, which makes placement of our ground equipment very difficult.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We don't have underground garages in this area. If we were to look at several of them, we did look at a number of the other apartment buildings in that vicinity. And unfortunately, there just isn't the amount of space that would be required.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's two, three, four parking spaces, very difficult for these apartment buildings to give up and even a question of city code given requirements of what they need to maintain. There was a question asked early, and I have the answer here in terms of we did consider the building adjacent to 1777 shoreline, which is 1801.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's the site that currently houses the T-Mobile. Again, parking became an issue on the 1777 Shoreline Drive site. We're actually looking to put the ground equipment into an enclosure that's kind of like a patio on the side of the building.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we're not taking up parking spaces at 1801. T-Mobile's ground equipment is in a like enclosure. So for us to go onto that facility would require us placing it someplace else on the property. And the landlord was not interested in us doing that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it was on their suggestion. We move to what is another one of his buildings. However, it's a separate parcel and that's why it didn't qualify as a location, even though the adjacent parcel has an antenna.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So many. So the question that I have still the other question that I have is so do people who are non AT&T cell phone users, do they benefit by from this new AT&T tower equipment that you're putting on?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not directly, because each its cellular provider has their own service. Now, there is a certain amount of of what's known as roaming where other providers might lease our service to provide their customers service within a certain area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you're if you're a T-Mobile customer and you live in the area. I don't know what the numbers, but near Shoreline Court. Right. Your service is integrated?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No. But if you consider how large each of these companies are, the number of folks that, you know, have our services, you can imagine there's quite a number of folks that, you know, would be our customers in this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other thing about the shoreline site is because it is the beach right there. That whole beach area is covered by by these. So intent is to and while there should still be coverage outdoor. It's a question of reliability of the service at that point too.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So particularly the summer months, you have a lot of extra traffic all over that island. You know, it's not just the residents who are affected. It's everyone who's passing through the area as well. So in closing on my remarks, we believe that the rooftops at 1538 St Charles and 1777 Shoreline Drive provide the best possible and least'",
        "'speaker_8': 'intrusive means to cover the significant gaps that we are expecting to see in coverage. And your planning staff and planning board have recognized that as well. With me today, five representatives from AT&T, from our engineering team, as well as our site acquisition team.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So between us, we can answer any questions you might have. Well, what I'd like to do now is invite up to the podium Mr. Bill Hammett. He's an independent third party professional engineer from the firm of Hammett Anderson to discuss radio frequency emissions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Since this has been a major topic of interest in turning our existing license. Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Council members. My name is Bill Hammett. I'm a registered professional engineer in the state of California. I manage a firm of 20, relocated up in Sonoma, and a regular part of our practice is the calculation or the measurement of radio'",
        "'speaker_8': 'frequency exposure conditions. We do this work for for AT&T, for AT&T competitors, for cities, for landlords. As engineers, our job is really straightforward. What are the exposure levels, either by measurement or by calculation? How do they compare to the standards?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In this case, we've done that analysis. My reports are a matter of record for these two applications, and I can state with assurance that these facilities will meet the federal safety standards. That's the threshold condition, as you've heard earlier, to take that issue off the table.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I did want to make one comment about the siting of these on apartment houses. The carriers have to site their facilities within the area that they're trying to serve. They can't go outside and leap into a place. They have to be in an area where they serve in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'San Francisco, as an example. They're on apartment houses all over. And so they have a rule that anybody who lives within 25 feet has to be offered measurements. So we were in and out of apartments quite a bit in San Francisco, and I put the meter together, I hand it to the resident, let them go wherever they'",
        "'speaker_8': 'want, and they're always surprised at how low the levels actually are, even if they're directly below. This is a high roof, but even directly below the facilities, as some people would be in this case, the levels are very low for a couple of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One is that the antennas are not. They have a physical dimension. If they were a point source, like the microphone or like a light bulb, the energy would go equally out in all directions. But they're not there, oh, probably eight or ten inches wide, which allows them to put them in groups focused in one general direction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this proposal, if you've seen it inside, they have antennas in three different directions to serve all the way around. It's more efficient just to reuse those frequencies. But what's interesting is the antennas stand four feet tall and that allows the energy to be focused down and pushed out toward the horizon is a thousand times less energy'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that goes down and goes out. So that's why directly underneath the facilities, the levels are very low. The other factor is that the energy doesn't like to go through something you can't see through. And if you'd like in a moment or two, I can show you what the whole spectrum looks like the electromagnetic spectrum, all the different'",
        "'speaker_8': 'frequencies and their positions. But what that means is that there's a thousand times less going down and what little goes down can't get through the roof. So the service provided is actually bounced off other buildings, comes back in through the windows.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's a very easy thing to demonstrate. And as I always like to do that for the people in the in the apartments is in great assurance that indeed it's really not an issue for them. The spectrum that I mentioned goes from 60 hertz.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's power line frequencies. So coming out of the plug over here, plus, minus, plus, minus plus, -60 times a second, that's 60 hertz is extremely low frequency. And that's where the power lines run on a wavelength. There is 5000 kilometers here in New York, very low frequency.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Above that, there's a big chunk of frequencies that are called radio frequencies used for radio and TV and taxicab paging and police and fire aeronautical frequencies is packed with different users in in that band above radio frequencies is infrared that we use to control our TV's or I have one in my shower I stand under it when'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I get out above that is a tiny sliver of the spectrum we call it light is our eyes are sensitive to it. This is all one big continuous electromagnetic spectrum. Above light is ultraviolet. And what is ultraviolet do?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If your sunburn. The waves are so short, they can get into a molecule and break off an electron. That's called ionization. Above above ultraviolet is x rays. When you go to the dentist and get an x ray, what do they do?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They put LED shield on you. And where does the operator stand when the times cut and they stand behind another shield? Because these are acknowledged as ionizing frequencies. They're the wavelength is so short, will get in and break off electronic causes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a little bit of damage over time. But what AT&T is doing is not x rays, it's not ultraviolet, it's not light, it's not infrared. It's down in this big chunk in the middle called radio frequencies. So there's nothing inherently dangerous about radio frequencies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They don't cause ionization. It's just a question of magnitude. And in this case, the magnitudes are tiny as a result. So I wanted to share those two concepts with you. I'm happy to talk about any aspect of the science or the standards that might be of interest to you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I thought those are would be useful points to raise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so comments. All right. Thank you very. Thank you. And I'm going to go ahead and call our speakers. And you each get 3 minutes. Jessica Reed breaks a bond. Sarah Cruz. Oh, yes. And on the slip. It's on in Charlotte.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any other students?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, so. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, I'm Anita Hughes. And I just want to say that evil didn't move down the list because because that they wanted really good cell phone reception, but they wanted to move down there because they have because it's a safe environment for the for the families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And also, I think that cell towers look really ugly on top of buildings, because if they're just hiding them, I don't think it's really good for other people because people might not know about the cell towers. And if they move into somewhere that they don't know the cell towers and they can get affected by it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's just all I want to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. On the slip. It also has Charlotte.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Um, she's not here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Jessica Reed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Honorable Member and council, honorable mayor and council members. My name is Jessica Reed and I am a resident of Alameda and have two sons. One currently attends violin school and another who will do so in little over a year, and both of whom who participate in Little League at Riddler Park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the title of my comments is Location, Location, Location. Thank you for considering the appeal of the installation of an AT&T cell antenna atop 1777 Shoreline Drive. This is not an FTC tower, as some have stated. This is a private commercial moneymaking enterprise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While the FCC says that we must assume emissions levels are safe and are not a basis for your decision, that's that's it. This is a private development over which you can determine its appropriateness to the location. Please note that I am not against cell antennas or cell phones.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm against bad locations for cell antennas. Please also note that any reference to the need for the antenna for emergency services, calls or safety is a red herring. All cell phone carriers are obligated to transmit emergency calls regardless of the caller specific carrier.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For them. This is about keeping customers and making more money, not about anything else. And no, I don't believe that is unwarranted criticism. Cynicism. Director Thomas has questioned how can he deny the antenna when he has approved others that he showed examples of?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I again say not all locations are the same. A cell antenna in the business areas of the city is still ugly, but it is different than one in the direct line of sight from a very popular and well used park.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Even one building over is different and less visible from the park and less disruptive of the skyline from that park. This will double the size of that elevator shaft, double it in width and in height. To my knowledge, they have not provided renderings from the park, and I think this is because they know what it will look'",
        "'speaker_6': 'like and it won't be good. While they have added alternatives since the Planning Board decision, most of these alternatives are not meaningful. They know the schools are not options and they use those. And nor is the beach. And now they have added three alternatives that would not fulfill their needs because they either already have antennas there or'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it is at the end of their stated service gap. I ask you to question the statement excuse me that the antenna cannot be co-located even one building over on 1801 shoreline. I have heard various conflicting reasons. AT&T said that it can't be there because there is no room for the ground equipment, and now it's because the property'",
        "'speaker_6': 'owner doesn't want it there. It just. It's just not clear to me. AT&T was told that they needed to come here tonight and tell you why none of the other buildings further south worked, including ones like Kitty Hawk and Franciscan Way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They haven't done that. Alameda Municipal Code states that the provisions of the zoning plan shall be held to the minimum are the minimum requirements for the promotion and protection of public safety, health and general welfare. This means that you can go beyond what the Planning Department decided.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can decide that our enjoyment of our open spaces and skylines is part of what adds to our general welfare. You have the authority and discretion to say that based upon the testimony, your own investigation, and upon weighing all the evidence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a bad location for the residents of Alameda and other visitors to Riddler Park. Please consider the wishes of the community and use your authority to say that this is a bad location. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Craig's on. And then Sarah Cruz. And Kerry. Sure. Oh. All right. There are crews. And then carry share it. And then Lester Cabral.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You mean Mayor Spencer and council members?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Thank you for hearing us tonight. And thank you for postponing your decision until you can get more input. We appreciate we appreciate that. Just a brief history of our experience with AT&T and cell phone towers. I work at myelin.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many of our families here are from myelin. When we found out that AT&T had a cell phone phone tower on myelin, we were concerned. We did some fact finding. Even my students did inquiry because of their concerns. I figured this was a good teachable opportunity to teach navigating technology and inquiry based learning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the concerns grew not just from our students, but from our parents. We met months and months and months with the school board meeting over a year. It started about a year and a half ago and together we worked with the school board to create this plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm I'm asking you that you honor this man that we worked so hard to create based on the concerns of our neighborhood citizens. I question the trustworthiness of AT&T because of our experience with them. They tried saying that our school district was legally binded to them in a contract for 20 to 25 years, when legally'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the contract could last five years and it was expired. So we had legal precedent to end that contract. I'm concerned about their maps. They seem pretty drastic about a gap in coverage. I wonder if there could be maybe a map from a neutral party to present some fact finding information to you about a gap in coverage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I could be wrong, but my understanding is that legally they have to prove that this will be a gap in coverage first. But I could be wrong about that. Again, like Jessica said, legally, it's not an issue of public safety.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If people need to make a911 call than any other company can put that 911 call through. So all in all, I'm asking you to just respect and honor our students feelings and concerns. I'm not asking you to deny AT&T s proposal, but deny their proposal for 1777 shoreline.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's really a slap in the face to if you're moving it right around the corner from where you're supposed to be taking it off. I feel like that's disrespectful and insulting. The fact that the alternative site analysis was on U.S. schools, too, it's just really disrespectful to me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I encourage you to encourage them to find someplace further away from schools. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Elizabeth Kerry, shared by Kerry. Good evening, Mayor Spencer and council members. I don't have too much to add to what Jessica Reed and Sarah Cruz had to say, but I do want to just be here because I currently can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm not restricted in my speech by federal, state or local law in being here to say I'm opposed to the proposed installation at 1777 Shoreline. I do appreciate the planning board directors reminders on the restrictions that we have on our speech regarding these types of installations and issues.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I do want to say I appreciate all of the detail that he went into regarding all of the efforts that the planning board has gone through so far in what is something that they do all the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But just because we do something all the time doesn't mean that it's a good idea. I agree with Jessica in saying location. The location for this is wrong. I agree with Sarah in saying that it's disrespectful to say, Oh, I can't have it in your yard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, how about over here? I'll stand right here. It's a not a reasonable way to engage the community. I understand that Awasthi is part of the county and part of the state, not part of the city governance. If the city departments can all work together, please do take into consideration what Awasthi and the county have also come'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to a conclusion about after input from the community in which we all exist. So I thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Lester Carroll. And then Andy Barr leaving. And then Dennis Wong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor. Council Members. Lester Cabral, resident of Alameda, 1538 St Charles. I own the property to the side and to the rear of that particular 80 year old apartment building. Now, there are residents in that building there and I assume some of them there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been in the past anyway. Are you through the Housing Authority or section eight program of some type? They live on the third floor up there. Now, T-Mobile has already put in a unit up there. Of course, they didn't notify anybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They said we don't have to. I guess so. Well, I never heard anything anyway. And on the back side of the building, if you want, if you look at the back side, you'll notice that there's a big chute that runs down the side of the building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I assume that's the encasement for all the electrical wires. They're running down the building into the basement. Now. I believe we have a real safety issue here. You know, there's an old structure there. You know, there are people that are living there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I know the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'FCC says, hey, trust.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Me, you know, we're going to do a good job here for you. Yeah, right. At the same time saying, look.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're only going to shoot radio frequency signals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, maybe today, but maybe next week, they may say, hey, now we have to use this type of signal in order to get an even broader base out there. I think we need to have some conditions put here, mainly on the property owner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're not going to tell AT&T what to do. You know, they're going to do what they're going to do. But the property owner, I believe, you know, he has a business license here in EL. I mean, he just like I do, I rent apartments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He rents apartments. And, you know, I mean, I can't put a a Hoosier in on top of one of my buildings there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why should he be able to put a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, a this type of antenna set up on his. You know, I think I think he has a limit and. And a liability to what should be going on there. We shouldn't just allow these guys to pop all around and say, hey, look, you know, we'll give you so many dollars and let us put this up'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on your roof. No, we need to control it. And the way I see it is through the business license saying, hey, you know, if you rent out apartments in their apartments, they're not for this other use. Anyway, I'm against this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hopefully we can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Come up with something here. It'll benefit everybody. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And about 11. And then Dennis Wong.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening again. I'm now just speaking on my own behalf and Bartoli Bien. I'm a resident here in Alameda, and I actually attended many, many, many, many of the meetings that went on with our school board related to this same topic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And along the way, I learned a few things and and I didn't speak up at the time because I I've always sort of felt that, you know, when parents are involved with their children, there's a certain level of of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know if respects or sensitivity that I wanted to propose, but I think for one thing that I happened to learn along the way is what many folks don't understand is that the the activity that we have in our own home, our own homes right now, actually exceeds many of what we're at least this is what'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've heard. I'm not an expert on. The wireless systems we have in our home is giving off the same thing. And you're much closer and much stronger. One letter that I read that was written by a resident that is an engineer then I thought was fascinating.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's one way of looking at this, is these antennas have been up for at least the last past ten years. Plus the level of use of of cell phones has increased dramatically in that time and also the type of use with more of the streaming and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So not only do we have more actual cell phones out there, but the use of them has increased that much of the concern here is related to cancer. And they that if you go back throughout anywhere, there's there's no correlation of an increased rate of cancer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know we want to be careful, but there's also a point of wanting to look at the facts. I think the gentleman that spoke previously that is an expert and talked about these things that, again, I try to understand, made it pretty clear that that it really is quite a limited level.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, should there be a way to find a better place on Shoreline then? I certainly would support that. But I also have noticed a very large change in lifestyle, said many people don't have home phones anymore, they just have their cell phones and that's what they use for their day to day life, day in and day out'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So by eliminating an entire area for a specific carrier, you're then putting our local residents in a situation that would be quite difficult. They may not be able to use their phones at all. They may or may not be able to make a change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It may be a costly change to them. So I'll put myself out on the limb and say if there is no other solution with the homework being done that I would support the presentation made. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You Dennis Wong. Then that's the last speakership I have on this item.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor Council. I actually came here to you to just visit. I'm from out of state. I'm a proud alumni of what? School and also a proud wildcat. The young lady you spoke earlier kind of inspired me as well as AT&T.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just have a number of questions that I think may be helpful for counsel and for also the citizens. One is there was a comment about discretion. Mr. Thomas made a comment that there is a little bit of discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where where is that discretion? And and again, I I'm I'm coming into this kind of dry, but I don't know if your city attorney actually reserves the federal and also state guidelines to see if you actually have some discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would think that if 18 to G tells you that you need a certain area, you're not required. To go ahead and ratify a specific location. There must be some type of a arrange. And I don't understand why we're spending so much time talking about this if indeed you have no discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't understand why they would have a consultant from Sonoma at 830 in the evening and three or four other employees here, if you had no discretion. And I have I also don't understand why. We'll see. Will, what school and the other school would pull their lease and possibly subject themselves to litigation if you had no'",
        "'speaker_2': 'discretion and there was not a safety issue and I was in Ms.. Ramsey's, I think it was rooms three, three, 16, math, and I can't imagine a parent sending a child to Room 316. It was we'll see what school with a tower right above there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And again, given the number and the volume of cell phone use, and it's going to be increasingly in that magnitude. So what I would suggest is that counsel and the city attorney actually look to see where you have discretion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would try to draft actually legislation to kind of put an end to this and say, hey, look, similar to to 90 registrations for sexual offenders, not near children or schools or high density areas, something like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And find out exactly what that parameter is that allows you to maybe put it in a in a more palatable place. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. He was our last speaker on this issue. Council members. I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madam Mayor, I just want to quickly begin by saying, you know, I. I called for review the matter of the 1777 Shoreline Drive item. Not for any particular reason, but because, you know, a member of the rest of the community misread, I believe it was asked for it to be reviewed so that we can get more information'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and to give them an opportunity. So and also, you know, I think it it saved like $300 or so. So I'm glad that we're having this discussion tonight and the incredible amount of information that we had to go through as part of the reviewing the planning board's analysis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The package alone, I don't know if you saw is like 350 pages. There's more pages on on this thing than what we're dealing with on site. Tonight, it was incredibly large and it's so complex in terms of the science, federal laws and the and the limited space that local governments have on matters like this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And. You know, it's a process has been put in place by the federal government and and the information was put through. And, you know, I think this is a good discussion that we're having tonight. Want to leave it at that for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other member. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Mary Spencer and I also communicated by email with the residents and the teacher, Ms.. Cruz, who communicated with me. And I also arranged the meeting with Joseph Camacho, who is the director of constituent services for our congresswoman Barbara Lee, in her Oakland district office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he came last week to our library and met with Mr. Thomas and AT&T staff and some of the concerned residents. And I do appreciate everyone's concerns, but I also appreciate the law and the law that applies and the difference just to distinguish for them, for the gentleman, the word school is with regard to, say, sex offenders'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and not being able to locate near a school or a playground. That's state law. But when we're talking about the Federal Communications Commissions, that's federal, which is another reason that I set up the the meeting with the gentleman from the congresswoman's office, because that deals with federal law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if laws are to be changed in this type of law, it's going to come from the federal government. But what we're doing is we're considering the appeal of a design review approval from the planning board. And I do not see the criteria from anything we've heard tonight to to overturn what the planning board, I think, very'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thoroughly considered and also did have their own conditions, which were sound like very reasonable ones. I was told that and I was out of town last week when this meeting occurred, so I didn't get to attend. But I understand from speaking to Mr. Thomas, who was there, that AT&T was to consider a possible alternative location on Shoreline'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Drive if if both the the site looked feasible in terms of filling that, addressing the coverage gap and also if you had a willing landlord, because those are the criteria that have to be met. And I, I understand that no attempt or no an attempt was made, but the building owner wasn't reached.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But yes, I think the mayor would allow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You to begin the mike. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She's asking you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Out of the meeting that we had last Thursday, we Verizon's question came up about this is Reed brought up a question of a an apartment complex on Kitty Hawk, about 700 feet to the east of of our proposed site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've done some evaluation of that site. We were not able to connect with the landlord. So that was one aspect we weren't able to connect with. However, on the analysis, we found that that site would provide 16% less coverage.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So a gap of residents who would not be able to get service if we were to locate on that particular site. The other issue that we found and I made quickly in my remarks about the the lack of of space for ground equipment, which could take up, as I mentioned, about three or even four parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That particular site is very constrained. Just about every inch outside of their their buildings and their inner courtyard is taken up with parking spaces right at the edge of the property. So that's why we with that one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, thank you for that clarification. Okay. So I think we take that one off the table. It doesn't sound feasible. But I also want to go back to what Mr. Thomas mentioned in the beginning, or I guess it's in one of his slides that the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The city is also recommending or staff is recommending for all carriers who wish to locate a cell phone equipment. Sites in our city, that is our city wide site of preferred locations be established because some will surely be less controversial than others and establish standard design and disclosure conditions for wireless facilities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Develop an expedited administrative approval procedure for while wireless facilities on preferred sites, you know, once they've been located. And then I was struck by something that came out of the meeting with Congresswoman Lee's staff. Was that and it was it was reiterated here today from, I think, the teacher, Miss Cruz, and misread that they felt that it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'was an affront that here they had worked so hard in this committee with the school district to get these antennae off of school roofs, and then they turn around and find it just on an adjacent property. Apparently, there's been a change in the personnel who are working on this issue when it came before the school board, as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand. But I do think we could use better communication between our school board, among, I will say, for the English teachers in the room among the city, AT&T and the school board. So we should I mean, I would assume that we know where the schools are, but, you know, maybe some other sites where children go, parks'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or whatever. But it should be in all this city we could in the future, you know, find some some sites that could have some mutual agreement on them. So I know we have a standing committee, right. And a representative of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Seated of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, at some point, we when we do, I think this is just an issue that could be an issue for discussion at some point. So that said, I appreciate everyone's input. I think we learn every time we have public input like this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I cannot find a reason to overturn the planning board decision. Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q Any other member already?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll try to be brief. So in the staff report, there was kind of an explanation about the difference between the city in our regulatory role and the school board as a landlord. So that the decision that the school board made was not a regulatory decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was a decision they made as a landlord and as a property owner. And my understanding is, if there was an application to put a similar tower on city property, that we'd have similar discretion as a landlord and a property owners would do that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I concur with both Councilmember De Saag and thank him and the mayor for bringing this to the council, because I understand there's been a lot of discussion going on. And I think it's important that those that who were opposed to this had an opportunity to have a public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think they appreciate not having to, you know, put up the $300 each. So I thank them for that. And I also want to pretty much echo what my my colleague, Councilmember Ashcroft, said. You know, we look at the design review findings and, you know, one, the proposed design is consistent with the general plan zoning ordinance'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and our design review manual. And I haven't seen anything in the presentation to show me otherwise. You know, two of the project is compatible and harmonious with the design and use of the surrounding area. You know, one of them is an apartment complex, apartment building in a complex that has these type of of boxes on it, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, one for the elevator, another building for another tower. And then the St Charles one, you know, there's already a similar structure or box enclosure for antenna, you know, I mean, we could debate whether it should be inside an enclosure or outside.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, I'm not quite sure. You know, I guess it's, you know, whether you think one is more attractive or one is more appealing. And, you know, personally, you know, I don't really want to see a cell tower.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I think the most valuable thing we can do out of that of this discussion is exactly what the planning director suggested is to take a strategic look at where. There would be acceptable locations for cell towers because it is a fact of life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And until we all give up our cell phones, regardless of who are carrier is. We can't complain about cell phone towers and cell phone coverage and drop calls at the at the same time or even participate in carrying this little radio device with us.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And that is because this is a very narrow topic that we're deliberating on tonight. We have to meet those conditions and it is a permit taken by private individuals within the law, regardless of what happened outside, if they followed the law and met the city's criteria.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Madam Mayor. In terms of my opinion on either of the towers, I think, you know, reading the materials, the 350 pages or so of materials, you know, the thing that crosses my mind is simply that the 1777 Shoreline Drive does not has not prepared a complete application, as a staff report says.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The FCC mandates that wireless facility providers conduct radiofrequency electromagnetic RF modeling for each site to ensure compliance with FCC exposure limits. That's in our Starfleet F report. The Planning Board Materials does not have an RF study for 1777 Shoreline Drive.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Know. It's not a complete application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think there's a difference between a complete application and what was on the agenda. So I think what we're hearing is that it was a complete application, but that it may not have made it into the packet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not on what matters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The the material was submitted to the city of Alameda. What I don't know is what actually went in your packet or what was what is currently posted on the website? I'm not.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Right. So I'd like to ask, does one of the speakers referred to, does the provider have to prove that there is a gap in coverage in order to add an antenna? They have to prove a gap in coverage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can we require that that be and if so, can we require that be an independent analysis?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We could, we could hire a third party to evaluate that, I presume? Yes.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'That's certainly something we could do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It we do as part of either approving either of these applications.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The issue that I'm seeing is just a one of timing. I mean, you can't if you approve it. I guess I guess what I'm trying to get my brain around is if you're saying you don't want to approve it because you want to do the third party analysis, I think what we're going to run into is a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'time problem both with the shot clock and 13, 1538. But more importantly, I'm thinking about the September deadline because we would have to delay the approval. Then you let's assume that the analysis comes back and verifies the gap.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then we approve it. They need to get the thing up and constructed. They have to submit for building permits. We have to issue the building permits, have to build the thing. And that all has to happen before September.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's on the shoreline property. It's a cause that votes on both, but one of them has a longer date.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, that's I guess what there is on the shoreline property. You have a little bit more time. We all have a little bit more time under the federal regulation deadline. But the real deadline that's on our mind is not the federal regulation deadline, but.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The deadline effectively to get these things approved and then built before the September shut down of the existing facilities. We're just concerned about the the the users of these cell phones who are going to lose service in September.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't know the exact number. So that's what I'm concerned about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What about requiring a business license to have these antennas because they are making money off of them? Yeah, the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm thinking it. I'm thinking maybe it would qualify as a business out of someone's home. It's actually a significant amount of money or off their property. I think it is a it's an interesting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the interesting it's an interesting business license. The apartment complexes already have a business license.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They have business license. Here's the issue. Federal regulations don't allow us to adopt land use regulations that effectively prevent. The providers from covering the gaps. So let's say we you know, city planner Andrew recommends we say no antennas in residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, if the providers can show.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But that's what I'm asking. I'm asking, can the city charge a fee as as a business license to have a cell phone antenna.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A no fee. A fee as a business license if you're going to have a cell phone antenna on your private building, because, I mean, they are making money. That's like another third.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or another unit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's actually a significant amount of money.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't believe that it's in our current business license tax list of fees. We could certainly look at that and potentially amend bring forward an amendment to do that. But at this point in time, I don't believe it's in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I understand. So can you tell me how much the property owner what's the monthly amount of money being paid to the property owners on these properties as part of this arrangement?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I, I just is are we getting I'm just concerned a little bit about the Brown Act and Sunshine and all this good things because I believe it's the design review and those specific criteria that Mr. Thomas listed about the appearance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think, you know, you're raising some valid points, Mary Spencer, but I'm wondering whether that needs to come back to us for, for instance, for consideration of amending our business tax license. But I do think we're getting far afield of the matter before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry. Sorry. It's not appropriate for you to speak at this time because we already had our public comments. However, I would think that so. So I appreciate that. And I'm not sure if I. That's what I would like to know.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'You want staff to do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Another issue that was raised is this. On the St Charles building, there's safety with the existing electronic electrical wires and the impact of having adding this antenna to an old building. Does city staff investigate and ensure that it would not interfere with the existing old wires or old building?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of these. I'm sorry I keep interrupting you that all these facilities go through the building permit, electrical permit process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yes. So as part of the process of adding the antenna, does that get inspected if it impacts the wires?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, it does. It requires an electrical.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a question in regards to the motion. I'd prefer I prefer if we separated out the things we're going to be directing staff to do separate from approve the resolution. So that the results of the motion in regards to approving the resolution speaks to this property and that the additional things be separate.'",

I think when we talked about comparing commercial rates across other cities, the response was that that's difficult to do because the types of businesses vary so much.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So our residential rates are based. It's essentially a flat rate that's based upon an assumed water use. Residential is tend to be more homogenous in terms of their water use. So to avoid the administrative burden of monthly water usage rate and assessment of sewer fees, it's a very common practice among municipalities to do a flat rate for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'residential that's on an assumed amount of water usage. Commercial, on the other hand, is volumetric. So there's a flat charge for having the sewer service charge. And then for each 730 cubic feet above and beyond that, there's an additional charge.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Term.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or the member already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry, Mr. Honea said. 30 to 35 staff. Can you explain who those 30 to 35 staff members are?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'll get into that later on presentation. So the current EOC, that's the lineup room for the staff. FEMA requires 50 square foot for a staff member in an EOC or recommends a minimum of 50 square feet per staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'EOC and we can fit 16 staff members in the EOC in compliance with the FEMA recommendations. If you look at those tables, there are six tables, two chairs at each table for 12 people for the police department briefing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, the EOC is just not a point in time during the disaster. It is that's one of the primary reasons to respond to the disaster. But it's also going to be a recovery operation following any disaster. It reimbursement for FEMA to put the community back together.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This will very much originate from the EOC. Furthermore, the current EOC is used daily by the police and so it's just not suitable for a long term use. As you can see, there's the basement of the police department, the hallway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is the equipment storage room. So again, when we setting up the is the current EOC in the basement of the police department, we have to pull all the equipment down. The radios, as you can see there, all the stuff out of the things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also have a storage container out in the parking lot that we have additional supplies in to pull the supplies out and set the room up. Probably takes a couple hours or so to an hour or so to hook up the room and get it working.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's some of the back again in the back area. The roof of the police station is maxed out as far as conduits going up to the roof and also additional capacity for satellite dishes up there on the old fire station.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's seismically unsafe. As you can see, the fire truck barely makes it into that single reinforced bank. That's a very tight. There's the house next door to the fire station. Fire Department is using the kitchen as a workstation area, too, so the kitchen serves both as the kitchen for the firefighters and as workstations for the firefighters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's the old fire station, the rented house next door that we've rented for approximately 15 years. Proposed ELC. The first floor has breakout rooms or offices in conference rooms on the bottom floor, dedicated datacom room and ADA required elevator electrical rooms and showers for staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The upstairs of the EOC can be reconfigured. We can have two separate ios's if we so desire. That wall during through the center is a movable wall. To break that down in the event of a large scale disaster, we can occupy the floor room.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the FEMA capacity in that room is 35. The Proposed Operations center and fire station or central structures, which by design will be able to survive a large earthquake on the Hayward fault. They are state of the art facilities that were provide redundant communication systems.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one of the things now, as with many things, the communication systems for iOS, these are migrating to the Internet. So out of the new EOC, we have four redundant systems, including a satellite transmission to Oakland and then two systems within the island, Comcast and our own system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A space for employees and food for disaster workers because the fire at the adjacent fire station has a kitchen. The proposed EOC is not a public safety building. I want to make that clear. It is a facility that will serve the vital needs of the citizens of Alameda in the event of an emergency.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During a large scale disaster, the EOC will be fully staffed 24, seven or a week or more. There will be staff to some degree for this for many months after our initial response. The response will take weeks of recovery and with where the first response will take weeks and the recovery will take months or years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The EOC will be actively staffed until all three all recoveries have taken place and will and all every mutual aid has been demobilized. Ordination of a long term disaster in a central and dedicated location is a key to effectively managing, documenting, recovering from the impact of a disaster.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These efforts in the event of an emergency need to be coordinated, and that is done in the EOC. The EOC is primarily staffed by the following city staff. The building official to inspect and tag buildings is necessary to protect human life.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A public works department to clear debris from the roadways, repair and replace critical infrastructure necessary to get the community up and running as soon as possible. Aluminum municipal power to remove downed power lines, reestablish electrical service as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The finance department to ensure that we are properly reimbursed by FEMA based upon records that they will maintain a public information officer to communicate to our citizens the extent of the emergency and what they should do and where they should go for assistance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Planning Department provides central dual situational awareness of what is occurring throughout the city so that city forces may be deployed to address the prioritized incidents. The Recreation and Parks Department to provide care and sheltering for displaced residents.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As an aside to that, the paradigm has changed. American Red Cross will not staff. They will have one representative shelter. It will be contingent upon the city to provide staffing for those shelters on a 24 seven basis, to provide food for those shelters, provide electricity, and get those things going.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We estimate 8000 residents in the city of Alameda will be displaced immediately. You know, a large earthquake event. They're the information technology department to ensure our ability to communicate with the county and state uses both to ensure our ability to ask for assistance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that is primary. The logistics section, which will locate equipment and supplies needed to care for our residents. We have a lot of challenges. We have to get everything onto the island by a barge. We have no seismically safe bridges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Arranging those services is going to be key. If we need large equipment to clear debris, we will have to barge in on to the island. That's a significant challenge. As you know, we built the EOC previously and had a bid protest and staff estimates, we say estimates that we saved approximately a half million dollars by rebuilding the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'two structures together. The recent bid had three strong pre-qualified bidders, all of whom had prior experience building essential structures. In all, the bids fell within a very close range of cost, which is a compliment to the architect. Saylor Consultants.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The project estimate has indicated the rebuilding the project will add additional 10 to 15% to our class. This three year project. Has been through an a community engagement process beginning in 2013, designed through 2014, was a plan of with approvals by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And bidding to pre pre-fall qualified contractors in 2015. Staff stands ready to implement this project as soon as possible. The time is right to provide the best possible response in the event of a disaster to the citizens of Alameda with the proposed fire station and Emergency Operations Center tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These structures benefit the entire community. And as we saw in the recent Napa earthquake, you can quantify the cost to build the structure, but you cannot quantify the risk if we don't. Therefore your police chief. Your fire chief and your public works director.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Are stand before you tonight. Recommending the approval of the contract before you. And we stand here to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members. If you want to ask questions at this point, do we have any speakers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do not. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, no speakers on this item. And then it's our turn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one minor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member only.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Had one minor question. Yes. Thank you for the presentation, Mr. Hunt. You mentioned something about FEMA and reimbursement. I mean, is there some. I thought I heard something about the ease of that or not ease of that. If we don't have any or see versus we do or are you able to elaborate on that at all or'",
        "'speaker_7': '. FEMA reimbursement has become very difficult. Okay. FEMA has gotten smart. If you want to say FEMA won't. It used to be if we had a sewer breakage, let's say along Santa Clara or in front of us, they would replace that whole block.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now they will go and we will have to show them the ten feet that actually broke in the disaster and replace that ten feet. Okay. FEMA wants us prepared. We are going through a disaster mitigation plan now. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Aaron Smith is leading that effort out of the public works department. We know that disaster mitigation is a FEMA document that encourages us to provide as much readiness as possible for any event. And that's the document we develop to prove to FEMA that we are prepared in conjunction with doing that disaster mitigation analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We will be having community meetings, meetings with the planning board, meetings with Shrub, meetings with the Mayors Committee on Disability Information on Disability. We will have a series of meetings to gain the community's buy in. Also following that effort, we plan to go through a series of community trainings led by Jim Friends and other members of staff'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to educate the citizens on disaster preparedness as much as we can educate our citizens to be ready. It's beyond 72 hours now. I think we're talking about a week. It used to be be ready for the first 72 hours.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'FEMA will give or it will only promise me that they will have water on to the island within 72 hours. FEMA's plan currently is to bring everything on the island by Hellcats. El cats with a large landing craft, the air driven the landing crafts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's their preferred method to bring supplies onto the island. They we've toured the island with them. We showed them the constraints of the island. We showed them the different bridges. And they agree that we are challenged. We do not specifically get penalized by FEMA for not having an EOC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is strongly encouraged again, and EOC is recognized by FEMA and nationally as the way to handle disasters efficiently responding, fast, getting quick situational analysis of what's going on. Choices have to be made in an EOC. It's an extremely tense environment as you're making decisions on life and limb.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could those I assume most of what you said is being done now is building independent. So all of the work that's being done at public works, etc., that can be done where public works currently has its office or actually convene in EOC when that disaster happens.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As somebody looked at the alternatives, like we have a very new constructed building right across the street. The main library that has very large conference rooms is wi fi enabled and of. Could accommodate the number of people that you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Has that been examined?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It has been initially examined. I built the library, saw I'm very familiar with the construction of the library. The library will fall 3.5 inches straight down. It will not have differential differential settlement. A question regarding the library. It would act to be acting as what we refer to as a cold EOC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would have to reconfigure the area in the library appropriately, hook up the appropriate communications equipment, and also take solar panels off the roof. Off the roof to allow the addition of satellite and radio transmission from the library.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have not gotten into the details to see if in the electrical room or if we have sufficient room down there. I did meet with the librarian on Monday and offered this idea. There is no room in their communication and data area whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would have to find a standalone communications and data room which is vital to the operation of any.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the other feature of the library is that at some point, you know, for a day or two, once a year or so often, you'd need to shut it down to actually do training there. Because that's one of the things one of the concerns that we have is where is a facility that we can do training'",
        "'speaker_1': '? And I think we want to do the training in the facility where we're actually going to be managing the event.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the trade off would be one day, $3 million pretty much. And, you know, that's I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think that's not the only trade off, but that is one of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's one of the considerations. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, during the recovery period, which will extend for a month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we have a disaster that's going to have a recovery period that extends for months. You know, I think that that's something that the the use of the library is probably a higher priority of of the EOC than it would be as library conference room.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also maybe I mean, I'll answer this and maybe the chief wants to answer it, but I mean, it's not a small disaster and a very large it's going to last for a month. Right. There are many things in between.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so, you know, it could be that you're using it more than just, you know, when the disaster actually is occurring. So, I mean, there's there's lots of variations in between on that theme.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand that I'm trying to make the most of what we have in front of us. And. I haven't seen the analysis shows the gap is like if the earthquake happened tonight, what is it tomorrow that we can't do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. I've been asking for that for, for quite some time and I got some up in our packet or I don't know if you got it. We got it emailed to us this week with a rundown, but there's no analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My main question, quite frankly, is it would if would the police station still be functional? The police station was constructed in 1978. It was designed in the early seventies. It wasn't until Northridge. That the earthquake and seismic codes really became evident in the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There was a lot of lessons learned at Northridge. And there is a lot of lessons learned in the Kobe earthquake is regarding liquefaction. This is not all new information since 1977. The police department is a very heavy structure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. It's got the jail below. It's got a lot of concrete in it, which was the theory behind, you know, at that point in time, we literally don't know how the police department will perform. But we're proposing tonight is a building that we know how it will perform as it's been designed to perform that way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's a highly regulated. Issue for the state of California. They are guaranteed to perform. Both of these structures will survive a 7.0 earthquake on the Hayward. We have nothing that we can guarantee like that. Not even the library.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. You listed various departments and personnel who would comprise the 30 to 35 people who are part of the emergency operations center. I think it's important to realize that one person or someone else who needs to be part of that equation is the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And. Largely because that is first and foremost the. Yeah. Responsibility of the mayor under the city charter, section six, dash one. The mayor shall be the official ceremonial head of the city and shall provide at all. Meeting shall be preside at all meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The mayor may take command of the police and fire department and govern the city by proclamation proclamation whenever the City Council determines that public danger or emergency requires such action. So there is I think the role of the mayor ought to be considered in the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Emergency Operations Center.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have addressed that role. And we've addressed that role not only for the mayor, but for the council. Okay. There is a room in the fire station. There's a conference room in the fire station that is specifically set up for mayor and council.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's great because in fact, I think it's not in the charter, but I think it's in the somewhere. There is an emergency council, I think, consisting of the city manager and and the and the mayor and some others in the event of incredible emergency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But like you said, you know, the situation what happened in Napa last year underscores that, you know, we're in a region where things can happen and. And you know, I think the message that you and also our chiefs have put out is that first and foremost, the facility, the emergency operating facility that we have right now is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'inadequate. I think anyone who's been in there, we ought to give the city towards anyone who has been in there, will know how inadequate it is. Moreover, no slap at the at the police department. Anyone who goes into the police department the way that, you know, it's very Byzantine how you go through from one one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So it's clearly I think they're I. I don't think I need science to tell me that we need a modern emergency operating center. So. It's not just for the police, it's not just for the fire department. It's just not or public works or anyone else or, you know, the mayor is for the residents of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like you said, we need something that's in the center of town that can respond. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city of Napa lost both of their elks during the recent Napa earthquake. The county, Napa County, which was in the Board of Supervisors chambers, crashed. The ceiling crashed in and they had to relocate their EOC. Okay. Same thing with the city of Napa in council chambers and they had to relocate their EOC also.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Both of those operations delayed their response by 24 hours. The napa earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, and what result did that have by delaying their response?'",
        "'speaker_7': '24 hours, potentially. Those fires on the trailers got out of control, is what they've told me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So thank you for your remarks tonight, Mr. Horne. And also, I'll be quick to acknowledge that I spoke to you this afternoon or this morning maybe, and also to both of our chiefs up here. I'm chief long for chief and chief for the three police chief.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And first and foremost, I want you to know that I have no dispute with the need for a new fire station three in a new emergency operation center. I have toured both of the existing locations back when we in 2012, when the city placed a sales tax measure on the the ballot within it in an attempt to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'secure funding to build a new fire station three, an emergency operations center. And at the time, I was asked by then police chief Paul excuse me, I'm looking at Mike Noonan to to endorse the measure. I think I was planning board president and I wasn't on the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll be quick to state that I didn't love everything about the sales tax measure. I actually thought there was too much in it, and I think maybe that's why it didn't pass. But that's water under the bridge, as they say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I did go back and take a look at the staff report from March 7th of 2012, because that was when the city council that council voted to place Measure C on the ballot. And I remember it because, again, Mike Noonan had taken me through the EOC and Mike Djerassi had taken the chief fire chief at the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'time, took me through first station three. And at that time in what's in the staff report is that the the staff report details how outdated and structurally unsafe and inadequate fire station three at 1709 Grande Street is and concludes that for that reason, a new fire station has been proposed and is currently in the design phase at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the corner of Buena Vista and Grand Street. So we call that a location in the design phase, sort of a nebulous term. The design calls for an environmentally friendly facility that we can house, that can house apparatus, equipment and personnel and provide the city with a much needed modern EOC on the second floor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So literally, since last October, when John Russo was still our city manager, I've been waving this around saying, But why isn't this adequate? If this was good enough at one time, when did we morph into aa3, not a three story at two different structures on a larger parcel that, you know, is partly Buena Vista in Grand, but'",
        "'speaker_4': 'goes beyond that over to Hibbard. And then we have the council has seen in their package the recommendations, not the recommendations, but the analysis that, well, if we were to merge those two uses now, we'd be paying even more than we're paying.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do appreciate that this evening, shortly before this meeting started, the police chief, Chief Hillery, got in touch with now retired chief Noonan. And let me know that apparently I mean, you could answer this, too, but I'll go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and apparently the concept at the time and I do understand the city didn't go forward with having plans drawn because unless the parcel tax the the sales tax passed, there wasn't going to be the funding to do that when it didn't pass and the city realized it still had these needs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they started looking and they realized, you know, that site actually isn't big enough. So then it did morph into these two distinct uses. So what I try to apply is my criteria. When ever I'm making a tough decision and this is a tough decision for me is what is best for the city of Alameda, for our'",
        "'speaker_4': 'citizens, what's the best use of our capital? Because this does come with a hefty price price tag. I do understand there's some grant funding for the EOC and the different sources of funding have been identified, including including some loans.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But there's also a debt service of almost over $5 million over the course of 20 years. What I said to Bob Hahn this afternoon when we were talking was that I when I think about resiliency, you have to get this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Does it require an answer? When I consider resiliency and making our community safe, it's all of the things that you listed. We don't know what our disaster is going to be. We don't get much of a warning. But what we do know is that we have aging infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The last week we finished up our budget hearings in public works, had an outstanding presentation that also detailed that we have old buildings that need to be renovated and some of them replaced and we have streets. Then we have water mains and sewer pipes under those streets and we are going along in a very methodical fashion doing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'those repairs and replacements. If we had more money in our general fund, we could do more faster. And that's that's something that I, I keep in mind also. But then there's a couple of other things that concern me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One is that I was very distressed when our city withdrew from the Rockefeller grant program a year or so ago because we were selected. It was a prestigious award. We were selected to receive a $1 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to be a recipient of this Resilient Cities program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what was especially attractive besides that six figure number of seven figures was that we had other cities in our region. I think Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco were also chosen in. I think we can also assume that any disaster does not stop at our city limits for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we will need to partner with our neighbors. I would like to see our staff go back and contact the Rockefeller Foundation, see if there's any possibility. We obviously qualified for the criteria at one point, if there's any possibility to get some of that back, because not only is the money attractive, but I think so are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some of the, say training opportunities, opportunities to learn from what other communities are doing so we don't have to start from scratch. So that would be something that would be very important to me if I am to support this proposition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also think that we need to start our training across these different departments and and areas that Mr. Hahn identified even before shovels are put in the ground or certainly before an EOC is built. And I think that for a number of reasons and again, funding was part of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're always, you know, juggling not enough dollars for the things we need and want to do. But I think we need to start now. We've got the buildings out at Alameda Point that we use now for the Sirt training.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They can be used for the training for these different departments, and I think there is some use of that. But I just I want to make sure that we are we are making best use of our dollars. I think you've made a pretty convincing case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I, I do understand that this is more than just everyone rushing in with laptops and setting up an emergency command center. This needs to be something where the exercises can be rehearsed in in the actual location. But I also have been concerned over the months and years even that we've been considering this, that it at first it'",
        "'speaker_4': 'sounded like the EOC was going to be a very sparsely populated, rarely used building. Now, I think we're seeing that we can make it a little more widely used and across a number of different departments. So I'd like some assurances along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And with that, I'll listen to the remarks of the rest of my colleagues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If I may, Madam Mayor, just a few comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I define resiliency as a slinky. If you take a slinky and you stretch the slinky, if you've kids, you have one kid at each end of the slinky and they pull the slinky slinky. I'll go back. Okay. If they walk outside and they take it outside in the street and they walk 100 feet away from each other'",
        "'speaker_7': ', that slinky is not going back. And I'm trying to put the Slinky back after the disaster. And this is what we need. We have started training already. We trained 35 people in this very chamber already. We're going to train another 35 people and another 35 people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're looking at three shifts of folks to staff the EOC. The main training will occur when the EOC is up and operating because you want to be there, you want to be able to know the screen that you need to look at all the time is right there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because in the operations when you're coming in, you're replacing somebody. They're going to give you a very brief briefing because they've been working 12 hours straight. And they're going to say, you need to keep your eye on these and these and this and this is important.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you have to have positional awareness of where these screens are. You're making fairly rapid decisions. You're making decisions about sheltering people. You're making decisions about rescuing people. You may have 200 people trapped on this side of the island.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You may have 500 people trapped on that side of the island. Where do you go to first? Those are the kind of decisions that will be facing us and requiring us to make these calls fairly rapidly. We want to ensure both that the training occurs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're beginning already. We're going to continue it through the years course of construction. So staff will be ready when the building is ready. And then we will continue that training, both for staff training and for citizens training within that very structure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so my point, if I could, Madam Mayor, is just that I do understand the usage as uses as usages of the EOC. The point about the training is that the disaster could strike tonight as we're leaving city hall or tomorrow or next week.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we have to be as ready now as we will be with this spiffy new building. That's that's my point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Surprisingly, a lot of the staff has already been trained on the resiliency question. I'm engaging right now with the resiliency officers of San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland. I have said meeting meetings with those people. They're very busy, very hard to get an appointment with them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But my strategy is to meet with each one of them, ask how it's going with the Rockefeller Foundation. How's it working? How's the coordination? Is it a good program and kind of get their feedback? And then I don't think after that engagement, if it seems to be going well, we can potentially revisit the Rockefeller Foundation and say'",
        "'speaker_7': ', would you reconsider us after this one year hiatus and see what their reception is?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for that information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. In a minute or so, we're on comments now or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, we do have a speaker slip now. Do you mind if I call the speaker? It was just brought to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, we didn't have before. John Spangler, would you like to come up and speak at this point? There is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Spencer, and members of the council and staff. My wife and I just got back from a non-emergency. The Warriors won tonight. 110 two. Our six giants are leading the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've been waiting to see. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just in case anybody is worried about the next big emergency, we're okay in those departments. And I want I want to address this project very seriously, though. I was in the room for the moment. Create a quick.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was working in a concrete structure that could have easily gone over with customers underneath heavy old cell heaters that could have fallen out of the ceiling. And some of the h-back stuff did fall and nearly killed one of the three part owners.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is serious business. It is not something I've been happy to see the council delay making a positive decision on for good reasons or not. Delaying is potentially suicidal. Councilmember Ashcroft, you mentioned you said we don't know what kind of disaster is going to hit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's true. We don't know specifically which one might hit. But the U.S. Geological Survey says the odds are better than 70% by 2030 or 2040 or possibly 2060. We're going to have the ground shake again. And we're sitting on top of not one but three major quake faults here in the East Bay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as the public works director ably said. In his presentation, which I was watching from home when I found out there were no commenters. This is serious. There will not be bridges. Everything is going to have to come in by barge or by helicopter or if you want us to swim across the estuary, I suppose we could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'bring them across a first aid kit at a time, but that's a cold swim, and I'm not sure that that's very safe for some people. So we have to do this on our own. I talked to people on this island in the last 15 years who say they're going to just leave the island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They won't be able to go anywhere. That is foolishness. We need a space that is earthquake safe. We need it now. Please approve this project tonight. No more delays.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Brody, where are you going to speak?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Thank you, Madam Mayor. And thank you for the presentation. And I appreciate my my colleague's thoughtful comments and concerns. You know, I kind of share a lot of those concerns, but like everything else we do here, we kind of have to balance and and weigh, you know, like the vice mayor said, you know, whether, you know'",
        "'speaker_3': ', this is worth this or this is worth that. So, you know, I look at the. I guess we kind of have a choice. We could approve this. We could not approve it and give direction to go off and split it off and reconsider that again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think if or we could just say no and not do anything. So. I don't think that's where I prefer to do, but I kind of want to address, you know, splitting it off from what I think.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Hong, I talked to you earlier. You mentioned to me that we've spent 700,000 on this already. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I talked to approximately $700,000, $750,000 on design, community engagement for both the structures. That's absolutely correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's a sunk cost that we've already already incurred. And then, you know, with your bidding this out together, you know, we've saved 500,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Approximately 500,000 by economies of scale, doing the two structures at one time, doing the site at one time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if we if if we decide we're going to split these bids or if we decide we're going to, you know, kill this, then, you know, to me, that's another 500,000 that know we're not going to be able to realize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And eventually we're going to have to do this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, that, you know, you're unable to split the bid. It was one single bid. So we're unable to split the bid between the two structures. But we would have to kind of do redesign, split the structures up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm almost positive we do have the contractor here that is the awarded contractor that these contractors, these three contractors who appear to be the best essential structure contractors in the Bay Area would not take an opportunity to rebid this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But my point was, eventually, in my opinion, we're going to need to replace the fire station and build an emergency operation center. I mean, that, you know, whether it's this year, whether it's in ten years, whether it's in 30 years, I mean, that's going to have to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Done, whether it's after an.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Earthquake. And then the sailor you know, the sailor report talked about another 1.5 to 2 million in cost. Right. So, you know, I look at that and I see, you know, adding it up. You know, that's like that's 3 million there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That if we suddenly said. We're going to stop this. It's not money out of our pocket that, you know, we're losing except the 700 and the 500. But it is a lost opportunity cost that if we delay, you know, we're not going to ever be able to recapture.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. To me that that figures into the equation as well. So that was kind of my my question. So if you are correct. Thank you. So in my opinion, so and then further comments, I also appreciate, you know, the hard work of the neighborhood that's gone into the planning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, this has changed since it was, you know, first proposed. You know, that's the process, you know, percolates through the planning process, percolates through the neighbors. The neighbors get their say. And, you know, as far as the design and the esthetics, you know, when we had the discussion on on the Del Monte Project, I mean, the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'opinion of the neighbors, you know, and the ones that live closest to it was most important to me. And the fact that they've been thoroughly involved in this process and they've come up with a design that they feel blends into their neighborhood and that they can live with, I think is very critical to me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But but the the thing that in a ways overall, in my mind this you said that Mr. Town, this is not this is not a police building. This is not a fire building. This is, you know, not a public safety building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is where if we have an emergency where the heart of our city's operations, you know, including the mayor and the council, the city manager, you said public works planning building officials, AMP financed the pill Rex and park it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, this is where they're going to function. And in my thoughts, it's not a matter of if we're going to have a disaster. You know, my thoughts are, you know, similar to Mr. Spengler's, we are going to have something and most likely it is an earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we can't predict what it is, but it's going to be an earthquake, tsunami or flood. This will happen. And I think it's our you know, our ultimate responsibility as elected officials and as council members, in my mind, is to protect our citizens, you know, whether it's, you know, making sure that, you know, if their structures'",
        "'speaker_3': 'get on fire, they get put out. If they call an ambulance that they get taken to the hospital, if they are their property or their lives are in danger from crime, you know, we do that. That's our number one priority.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this, I think, is our utmost responsibility here, especially given the propensity we are to the to the water and the faults. It's our utmost responsibility to be prepared in the event of this emergency that, again, will happen, not might happen, but will happen and probability it will happen sooner rather than later, especially an earthquake on the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hayward fault. So, you know, I feel that if. I guess it's another one of not on my watch comments, you know, not on my watch. Do I want to be the counsel that says we're not going to prepare for this, we're not going to be ready for this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to do everything we can to be ready for when this happens. And I appreciate all your hard work on this. And the police chief and the fire chief and you said it best, but I will re re-emphasize it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we can quantify the costs of delaying. We can quantify the cost of debt financing. We can cost quantify the cost of savings, you know, on combining bids or delaying. But we can't quantify. The risk of not doing anything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's where I come down on the scale. And I think you can and I'm prepared to support this moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And. I may be inclined to support this. I just want us to be sure we're going into this with our eyes open. I don't disagree for a minute with Councilmember O.D. that our ultimate responsibility as councilmembers is to protect our citizens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that takes many different forms. And in a perfect world, we'd be able to replace all of our aging infrastructure and buildings and hire, you know, more personnel that we need and also build these new buildings. So I think we just need to understand there's going to be some trade offs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are incurring debt. But, you know, we have many we choose to spend it in different ways. And so just so public works, for instance, knows I told Mr. Horne today, I mean, I'd like to wave a magic wand and let you get all your your wish list taken care of, because I think we're better served that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'way. I. So. I do. I do actually want to report back from the public works director on the air. And I think I also discussed this with the interim city manager about getting back in contact with the Rockefeller Foundation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just think, you know, maybe they have some hoops for us to jump through, but, you know, everything comes with a price tag. But I definitely think the benefit of partnering with them and availing ourselves of the training and this is something that's going on worldwide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, really, we should be doing this for our citizens. I, I don't think, you know, this is something that we decide whether it's convenient or not. I want to see this done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm hoping to have something before you before the end of the year. Regarding that item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You said before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I said I hope to have something before you before the end of the year regarding that item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. It's May now. I'd hope it would come a little sooner than that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, but I'm going to have to meet with all these first for us, and then I'm going to have to reengage with the Rockefeller Foundation. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's just that I recall having this conversation, say, six months ago. So I you know, or before you know how I am. Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a comment. I think as far as Fire Station three goes. Everybody knows the situation at that fire station needs to be replaced. There's enough development, new development on the northern waterfront now and in the future to warrant its operation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that is without question. The emergency operations center, I still think, needs analysis as there has been. No fine analysis again, either by fire drill or disaster drill that shows what our shortfall is, what our time is. And I'm assuming and I'm glad to hear that there's training going on and I'm glad to hear that there's coordination'",
        "'speaker_2': 'going on. But I think it'd be very it would have been a very valuable exercise before this started to have that codified. Whatever the shortfalls in the drill were, were codified to point to what's needed. And as I go down the list here, and I would prefer to have that center here in the center where there's the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'police station, fire station, Park Street and city hall, because all of those players are going to be playing in this in this activity in the emergency operations center. And I think that's the way our our emergency response plan is written, that it can be convened.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not specified where it's convened. And I'd like to make maximum use of our buildings and other see other options, not just this or that, whether we retrofit, whether we use existing or whether we build new should be laid out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. And then finally, these are our people driven, and I'm glad we've got the team that we've got here, because I think they're going to execute. But. Out how we put our money in and where we put our money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we have to look very carefully at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate comments from council members and staff. Your report public not just here but outside here and also emails and whatnot. I have questions in regards to first of all, the are our emergency water supply system. And it's my understanding that in the past there has been discussion of salt water pumps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There has recently been speakers regard to that and letters to the editor and whatnot. And I think at the beginning of today's meeting, Mr. Hahn spoke about it being mad, and then we wouldn't need saltwater pumps, but I don't think we've ever had that discussion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. We are looking back into getting a. Emergency water supply or the city. We've looked into it in the past and had different options with the different equipment and a large diameter hose and saltwater pumps that would supply those hose in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It comes with a very large price tag. We've gone to FEMA and asked about grants to to purchase that. And because we've been so successful in our grant processes before, we have built strong relationships with FEMA. And we've been told and we've received letters that FEMA does not fund projects like this, that we would need to find'",
        "'speaker_7': 'funding somewhere else. We have reevaluated. We've come up with a plan now with some different options that we're starting to look at as far as having an emergency water supply. Currently, we do have a new fire boat that can supply 2000 gallons a minute through the five inch hose that we carry on our fire engines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we can do that and pump it up the street or we can just have the fire boat fill up our fire engines that have 500 gallon tanks and shuttle water to where the fires are. We also have relationships with the large tug boats.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Down by the BO back buildings that can also supply large supplies of water force for our firefighting efforts. But we are putting a new committee together with community members that have interest in this, to look at ways to to fund this project, because to this point now, there still is no grant funding for such a project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's based upon the letter to the editor. It was back in 2007 that the fire department established a project team to look at this. And at that time, it's my understanding that there were already pumps installed in San Francisco, Vallejo and Berkeley, and that this team did conclude that it would be important to get these saltwater'",
        "'speaker_0': 'pumps. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's that's correct. And I still believe that's important to have an emergency water supply. It's a matter of funding. If you'll support it, I'll bring you a proposal tomorrow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so for me, this is important because we are talking about, if I understand correctly, an emergency center here that so that an emergency operations center, so that in case of an emergency, we have a center, we have fire stations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're being asked to modernize or improve another fire station. But if we don't have an emergency water supply, water supply if we don't have that. I don't know how prepared we are to respond to any emergency. And it sounds like these other cities have dealt with this and they did it prior to 2007, and we have not'",
        "'speaker_0': 'prioritized it. And we are going through our budget process. And when I look at what we're being asked to approve tonight, I don't think we're being afforded the opportunity to to determine what is the priority. And I think that's what the budget process is for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd be happy to bring that. I mean, the vice mayor actually has a we have a parking lot of issues that we're going to be bringing back. We can add that to the list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that's important to add to the list.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also probably in the list that the interim city manager is going to put together, I believe, because Mr. Chief Long and I met with Ken Laban, who is one of the proponents of the water pump idea. I think we learned that the city of Berkeley actually did a ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They did. And that's and the citizens of Berkeley voted to tax themselves to buy those pumps. Because I'm, as the chief indicated, they are expensive. So if you're going to look into what other cities have done and certainly the way they funded it would be good to know to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I agree with you on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we've we've looked into various options, whether large cisterns, which are large tanks, could be placed strategically around the city, whether they're under arks. That would be a place where we could draft and supply water to our fire engines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Another possibility is buying large water tankers, which FEMA kind of pointed us in that direction, to look at our rural fire departments that don't have hydrants, how they fight fire, and they use the water tankers generally at least two.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they're shuttling one is at the fire supplying, the other is getting filled up. That would be a start. Because the the above ground system that gets laid on the ground, the large diameter hose in an earthquake or this natural disaster, there may be so much debris in the road that we may not be able to lay'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that at home and we may need to go zigzag with the tankers to get to where the fires are. But we would like to have in our arsenal different options based on what our our emergency is. So we'll be looking at all those options, finding out what the cost is along with that citizen committee, including Mr. Gottlieb'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that. And then I have my next question is when I look at the funding sources for the EOC and the fire station of the EOC, it's my understanding that the bonds were already refinanced and the sources are this capital project, 400,000 tax of unspent proceeds from that from the bonds 863 and then the refinancing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of the cops. And that was EUR 3 million. So I think that that's covered the financing for that. However, the financing for the fire station. It's not covered that will actually go to the general fund and or 20 years as my guest for oh for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we're we're being asked to is this correct? We're being asked tonight to approve a 20 year loan that we repay out of our general fund in order to finance the fire station.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually, that actually has been already approved. That right. And the debt service is in the general fund and it's about $200,000 a year. So the funding sources that were listed in the staff report, a lot of them have been approved.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the two funding sources that we are bringing up tonight, the eye bank loan and the proceeds from tax allocation bonds, the tax obligation bonds were already identified as a source, how they or they haven't been appropriated for the staff to spend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's why it's included in the staff report to ask for an actual appropriation in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To continue on that one. What else could those money to be spent on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Um, I believe it's tax allocation. Bonds is from a redevelopment area which is technically gone, which is now a successor agency. So any proceeds from the tax increment or that were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Subject to tax increment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Repayment will have to be approved within the redevelopment area. In that particular case, the fire station is within the redevelopment area and is an appropriate use of the proceeds and it was identified. Correct me if I'm wrong by prior counsel that that is an appropriate use and should be used for that purpose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For you? Continue on that money is Alameda Point near the Almeda Point Collaborative part of that area. No one else is in that. But is that do you know what that area is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's the B web. It's the it's the old be web. So it's the old it's essentially the northern waterfront area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By the waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just for the sake of alphabet soup avoidance, there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is this waterfront improvement project, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Water improvement project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And in regards to the I bank loan on here, it says an estimated additional debt service anticipated not to exceed 300,000 annually or a total of 5.3 million over the 20 year term. Along with there would be savings of 50,000 a year because you wouldn't need to lease the adjacent house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then but then there's also additional fees of approximately $1,000,000 on this loan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the I bank loan, which was the cheapest for the city after the city actually contacted its financial advisers to find out what would be an appropriate funding source. With. I think their whole purpose of their program is they issued tax exempt bonds and distributed to other agencies such as Alameda in a smaller dollar amount.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the understanding that we have, as I have, is that we've tried to contact our financial advisors and they looked around to see what is available and what can be used for the city. The cheapest way, in essence, to finance this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There were a number of things considered or looked at by. They certainly advised that this particular option was the best just because it had a very low interest cost. It's mentioned in the staff report it's 2.29%, but they are also charging certain fees and the fee is one time payment of $30,000 when the financing actually occurs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then they charge a point 3%, I believe, each year. And it's on the outstanding principal, which totals about $96,000 over 20 years. So there's also an interest cost of 2.29%, which is about $1,000,000. So if you spread it up over 20 years overall, it's fairly cheap way to get financing just because it's was made specifically for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that particular purpose. And as a matter of fact, both chiefs, the public works director myself, went to Sacramento when this particular loan was considered by the eye bank board and they won that unanimously approved it, and were very encouraged that Alameda is in essence a perfect example of the use of I bank funding because it was in'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a small dollar amount. It's in essence cheaper than any other financing that we could have gotten because of the small dollar amount and the period of time that we were looking to finance it over.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. And that's $250,000 a year for 20 years, which I think is $5 million is what we're talking about when you include your principal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct? What's the. I thought the debt service was 200,000. It's about 200,000. The additional, I think a roughly 50,000. It also adds the internal loans that the city is looking forward to take from fund building maintenance fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that particular dollar amount was actually included in the proposed budget in anticipation that it might be approved. And so then I bank loan will not actually start require a payment until the construction of the building is actually done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So until then, we're going to actually capitalize the interest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When do you anticipate that will be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'According to the Public Works director, we believe he believes he should be able to get, once everything is in place, complete the construction within about 12 months period, I think because they tend to be conservative when they provided the estimates expected 12 months plus an additional six months.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that's part of their policy when they did the calculation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Amir, quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you quickly reference capitalizing the interest. So we're capitalizing the interest on a loan from ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct? No. From the eye bank.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, from eBay's bank is capitalizing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Okay. Sorry. I thought you were specifically referring to my bank rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what that refers to is that you don't necessarily have the revenue stream to pay off the debt service. So so the interest that you don't pay its rolled into the principal that's well capitalized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to finding which bank to get the loan from. It sounds like we had a consultant. As opposed to just going out and shopping banks and finding that getting offers from banks specifically for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's what our that's what our financial advisor does actually does.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do shop.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At. Absolutely. It actually, we we got a phone call from former finance director Fred Marsh today saying that we did actually contact at the time Bank of Alameda, which is now Bank of Murrin. So you confirm that? Yep.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Two calls to former employees today. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So we don't. So. So. This is not coming through our budget process that we're being asked to approve this prior to looking at our budget. And we do have a multiyear budget that shows the deficit after actually, I think this year these numbers, we have reserves, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These numbers are already incorporated in the budget because we assumed that the project was we wanted to make sure we have we did this for everything. We wanted to make sure that it was fully loaded. So all these numbers are included in our not only in our two year, but in our five year projections.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So is there a reason why this is not why this isn't coming back at the same time that we're approving our budget? Because I know we do have a park parking lot, if you will, of other things to come from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is asking for money from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We asked the bid and Bob can talk to this. When we went out to bid, we asked them to hold it for 60 days. That 60 day period ends, I think, at the end of this week. So that's the reason why there is some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if you recall, when we when we came in, I think it was March, we wanted to go in early spring when the bidding environment was was a good environment. And, you know, in early spring, in the winter, we didn't want to wait until summer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that was the reason why that happened.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just to be clear, the the hodgepodge, the big 5000 feet view of this, the reason why we're driven to the hodgepodge nature of of different revenue sources is because years ago, Measure C, I forgot, did not fail.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I did not win at it. One that would have been a more seamless way, you know, it would have been so absent that. City Manager Russo, in conjunction with the then City Council, including myself, looked about it because we believe that there was a need for an EOC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we so we had to put together this hodgepodge of, of various funding sources and these, you know, these are real, real decisions that are being made because certainly, you know, some is coming from somewhere. But that was a council decision that was made in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, and as the city manager had indicated right now that the budget that's being contemplated now bakes in a cake, these cost considerations. So that's the background.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate I want to respond to that because I appreciate that and I appreciate you actually reminding me because so I see two things here. I see the EOC and the fire station and I see them that they were put together to bid both to say 500,000 is what it sounds like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the IOC has its own. When you when we talk about why that's so critical and urgent and all of that, I think that those arguments go to the EOC separate from the fire station. And it and the IOC has these funding sources lined up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The fire station does not. The fire station is the one that requires the 20 year loan from the general fund. So so to me, they are separate. I appreciate that they were put together. It's the fire station that requires the loan from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Well, we're going to be paying it from the general fund, but not for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The IOC from the general fund, because those cops are general fund funds that are in the general fund. They're paid for the cops, the refunding that we did in 2013, and we withdrew the 3 million for the EOC, that that service is also in the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to make sure what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I fear this is different things because we're taking out another. We already have committed to this. The city has already refinanced the cops. That's correct. So that was already done. The city has not committed to this loan because if we don't proceed with the building, then we won't be responsible for paying the loan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's true, I think. So those are separate issues. Those are separate financial decisions we're being asked to make. And I think that so so when you look at that, when you look at the EOC, though, the city is already committed to those sources from our general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're not asking for new. That's true. Okay. Okay. Thank you. So then when I'm looking. So to me, they are separate. And do we is it appropriate to put Fire Station three ahead of other issues in our budget?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this point? When we do a two year budget, we have been asking our community to come forward and talk about other things and how we're going to build. And I think we actually have a relatively long list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had initially suggested to our departments to have a one and a half percent reduction across the board. We came back as a council and we said, okay, we're going to try to look at reserves and other sources to avoid that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we haven't run those numbers yet. There were at APEC in regards to their living conditions and which buildings we can demolish, if any, if there's any moneys we can set aside to improve the conditions there. I think that's one of the things on the parking this I think we actually put quite a few things on the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'parking list that our community thinks is important. So a concern I have is. Is there a way to go forward with this EOC and hold off on the fire station until we complete our budget process, which is middle of June?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not the way that we have it right now. We have because the project was bid with both projects. So we would have to reject all bids and then go back out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. In which case, in regards to the fire station, there was a report in 2009, International City County Management Association Data Assessment, ICM, that suggested closing station three is my understanding on page 43 of this report. Then it also suggests on page 45 that the training center should be adjacent to the administrative headquarters as confirmed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the vice mayor's concerns are that was in this report, that report. And then I know and I feel like this has not been discussed where we've actually discussed do we need a fire station three. As regards to looking at these reports.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that report was done in 2009. And then I have another report from 2007, I believe, that says that we need to improve some of our fire stations. And I don't think we've done the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What was the year of that report?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This report is 27, I believe, twice city gate associate. And then but then after that 2009, another report was done and. And now it seems like we haven't just we're trying to. I think this decision to go forward with Fire Station three based upon the consultant's reports that fire councils have had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The latest report is that it's not appropriate to questions. It actually says recommend recommends closing station three on page 43 of that report. I appreciate that we have competing reports here, but it's like, okay, so when it's so important by spirit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It gives me a thought on that because you picked a point that I was going to make. One is the cops refinancing. My understanding is if we go back to the people who bought the bonds that can be used for the fire station if they approve it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is that correct? That's right. And then the second thing is, after I think the council has to consider it's a good point about the ACMA analysis, but what happened in 2012 when the multifamily overlay got laid on the northern waterfront, the number of people who were going to be live that 229 didn't anticipate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you have 2400 units, which is not even to zoning but it's when our with what's in our land inventory. You could have 6 to 8000 more people living along a place that's true or underutilized. So I'd like us to consider that when we're talking about fire station number three and the future of development on the northern'",
        "'speaker_2': 'shore of of our city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would just also add that I think in the intervening years, we closed a fire station, added Alameda point. And I concur with the vice mayor that we we have more development now in the northern waterfront and we have more property leased out at Alameda point in those businesses and residents too including Alameda Point Co collaborative'",
        "'speaker_4': '. What I think I'd be very vulnerable without fire station three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to let police chief. I'm sorry, fire chief respond. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. You're referring to the ACMA report that was done in 2007.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What does that stand for?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'International City County Management Association. Prior to that, there was a report done by Rayland Research and. Then there was City Gate, which I provided you today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then there was ICMP. And then there was another report done by trade data. All except the ACMA report were fairly consistent showing that basically what we're doing we have about the correct staffing model which shouldn't be cut.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The City Gate report shows that at the time that it was done, we had the five stations fully staffed. They said we could adequately, adequately respond to a fire on the second floor of a structure. And that was really about it recommended that we couldn't go.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any further down without reducing any companies. We've done that by closing station five, so we've gone below their recommendation. The ACMA report was very contrary to any of those other reports that their staffing models said that we should really only have two fire stations for the whole city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Reading through it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. They counted on office staff to jump on the fire engines and. And respond when needed. And it. We found. It just didn't make sense. We didn't see really how it applied to the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we found was that. I see Emma was more or less called out across cities across the country, specifically in Michigan and Oklahoma, for basically having a boilerplate template report that they were charging cities for. It came to a head in 2009 in Lake Havasu, Arizona, where.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The report that they provided to the council actually still had city of Alameda Fire Department on it. So they. The reports have been very discredited and that kind of goes to show why it really didn't line up with the other reports for staffing in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think I can I can leave it at that for ICM.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that. So thank you. On the emergency water supply, do we have a commitment from East Bay Med that we will have that working and by 2020? And is that? Is that we will not require any salt water pumps if we have that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If if he's been about replaces those two pipes, he's favored but guarantees me that they should be able to pressurize the island to a sufficient extent for firefighting purposes and potable water purposes. Okay. They have made a verbal commitment to me on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They will reinforce that commitment in our rescheduled May meeting. Madam Mayor, that you and I have with these families coming up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And does that cover they farm island as well as the main island.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Bay Farm Island. It is less of a concern because the pipes are actually coming through. That's not a water crossing. Okay. Again, the water crossings are our our challenges. A bay farm island is a pipe that's typically buried in the earth, actually performs fairly well in an earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. I mean, yes, there's instances. And if there's a fault line, there were a specific grade. But generally, as with tunnels, they tend to move with their earthquake.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd just like to add that I'd like to see commitments in writing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Excuse me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd like to see commitments in writing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, I will definitely get it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a commitment in writing, we are waiting for the mayor and I had a previously scheduled meeting that we had to cancel. And so once we get that meeting with the higher level of respect.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's because of protests in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think isn't easy, but going to do a presentation for the council to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The East Bay. But it's going to be really doing a presentation on the council, I believe the next council meeting June 2nd. 10th and June 10th regarding our water usage and the savings that we've read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry, it is the second one, Laura, saying that it's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. The second staff told me it was the second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're approaching 1030. We need a motion to consider the remaining items, which is 60 of PSI, a sum.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Four votes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to pose for 4 to 1 motion passes. Um. Okay, so another question I have on the fire station. So we went out there and we visited it. And it's my understanding when the when the firefighters get dressed to come out or something, that there's some reason why you can't get dressed inside on the second floor'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where the rooms are. And you discuss that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of research is showing that the turnout gear that we that we wear, the black firefighting outfits, they get contaminated with the products of combustion. When we go into to fires, it actually gets absorbed into the material. And then in farther because of you're sweating the steam, the water that you're around.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And when you get back to the firehouse, even after they've been cleaned, they do what they call off gassing, which is toxic gases which have been found to cause cancer. So what we've implemented is that we do not allow wearing of turnouts within the living quarters of the firehouses anymore.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So at our other firehouses, the crews wear shorts and when they get a call, they go out to their the fire apparatus and the apparatus from the garage, basically, and their turnout gear is sitting there for them. They change their they step in, they go on the call, they come back, they get out of that gear and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'it stays outside of the living quarters. The problem with fire station three is we have two separate buildings. They need to leave their living quarters and go to another building to respond. So. Basically, especially at night, they almost need to get up, get dressed, go next door.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Get dressed again and we have a delay in response and in inclement weather. That's a problem also. It's an additional delay in response. We're also dealing with the stairs that you saw, which are are kind of an accident waiting to happen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They're steep or they're not level. That firehouse also doesn't have the amenities of of being a fire station. It doesn't have adequate space to for storage of extra ozone equipment, places to to clean, soiled EMS equipment like like water vomit out of suction units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's other firehouses have. Large things outside of the stations. So that's another delay for Station three, because in order for them to clean their equipment, they need to go out of their district to another station, clean their gear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And while they're doing that. Their district is basically unprotected. Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the new fire station will address this issue so that the firefighters then that changed in a garage or somewhere where it's not out on the grass or front of the building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They'll just go right from their living quarters out through a door into the apparatus room where their gear and there are engines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this is an issue for me in that there's a female firefighter there that I understand has to run out, get changed in the front yard and then go to the fire engine. That's correct. That aside, I think it was described.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's that's how she said it when we were there. Well, I don't think she. But she she doesn't she doesn't change in the front yard. But she says she does.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You may have spectators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or boxers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She got. So actually, this is what she described. And this was. Disconcerting to me. And it actually suggests I wonder if there is some possible liability in regards to having our firefighters in the moment, especially going out to the front yard in her boxers to get ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're in pretty darn good shape. But isn't this actually an argument for why we need to replace Fire Station three?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's what I am speaking to this. I actually think it's important to share with our community why these? Because this is this is a lot of money. And we've talked about a lot of different things to the EOC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Personally, I can say it's more it's easier for me to support that than a new fire station at this point. I would have preferred having the fire station come to us later when we look at all the other budget things that come from the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's not the way it's brought to us. So that's why I brought that up. I think it's important for the community that it's urgent. Any other comments?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Madame Mayor, I think there's a recommendation by staff that's before us to move forward with staff recommendation. And I think I heard a desire to report back on the on looking into.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The Rockefeller.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rockefeller.'",

The public understands what what the situation is. And I think I'm ready to make a decision and I would like to make a move.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Not at all. This is just a replacement of an existing facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I'd. Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was just going to say, I think especially Chief Long coming back up and and giving us the explanation. I know you're the fire chief, but it does make me realize that, you know, fires are one emergency that can happen just on their own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they also happen in the course of something like an explosion or an earthquake. And so I think listening to all of you and Miss Adair, you still hear a really good job explaining the financing aspects of all this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So while I am never I don't spend the city's money easily. But on the other hand. I think it's time for us to get up to date on our safety and emergency preparedness for this city. So I'm willing to a second councilmember designation and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the concern about the salt, the emergency water and trying to work with our team, our community members and moving forward with the plan, because I don't think it's appropriate for us to have to not address that issue.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'development agreement was 20 years. So if it's executed this year, that's 2035. The project milestone, the schedule that the developer has put forward is actually a 15 year development schedule. We were very appreciative that the developer did not max out the full timelines of the 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they've actually been very aggressive about their milestones, schedules and their performance and we appreciate that. And so what that project Milestone Schedule says is that the Phase three completion of the project, which is the the final phase, is expected to be complete in 2030.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are potential extensions to this, which I'm going to get to in the next slide. But that puts phase one, essentially each phase at about five years. It's a little less than five years. The potential extensions to the milestones schedule are only allowed on major milestones.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So closing on the transfer of the land. Completion of infrastructure completes completion of vertical. And then there's these progress milestones. So for instance, design review or commencing infrastructure, we they're in a schedule. We want to keep track of those things because that's early indicators of whether or not the performance is likely to occur or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But they're not events of default. So if they don't meet those project milestones, that doesn't have the same consequences. What we really care about is, are you closing on the land or are you completing the infrastructure, you're completing the vertical.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so those are what we have defined as major milestones, potential extensions to the milestones schedule. Overall, there's a cap, a ten year cap on extensions. So that puts us if you and that's from the milestone schedule. So 15 years, they're being very aggressive about their schedule.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They get to ten year cap on all extensions and I'll outline what those are. So that puts kind of the outside date at 25 years of five years past the 20 year term that was contemplate in the in a only if certain thing only if they are able to to qualify for certain extensions, extension payments, they're allowed'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to take five extension extensions by paying the city for those extensions. Those extensions are much more expensive before phase one at 50% of phase one infrastructure, $50,000 an acre after phase one infrastructure that goes down to 10,000 acre.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The thought there is really that once that phase one infrastructure, the phase one infrastructure is a very large amount of work. And so once they've made that investment, we believe their incentive is to build the project and get it done because so much money has gone into it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we've kind of reduced the option payments so they have an elect they can elect to extend those major milestones, closing completion of infrastructure, completion of vertical by paying the city to extend. That's and that's limited to only five of the ten years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Then there are two other ways that the term well three other ways but economic force majeure which is if the economic there's an economic downturn, that there's a decrease in the home price index or a certain number of years that they can qualify for an economic force majeure extension, and that it's a very high bar.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so it's really comparable to what we experienced in the recent recession. We had our financial consultant, Wealden, who's here today, actually chart out that index over 20 years or something over 20 years. And the only two times we met that threshold was when there was a really severe recession.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we've kind of calibrated this index to recessions that have occurred in the past. So we feel comfortable that we're only going to be in that economic force majeure situation when we're really experiencing a significant downturn in the economy and then a standard force majeure, which is which is more standard, which is really things that, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', major issues like a disaster or essentially water supply. There is no water supply or some major disaster, a war or some other thing where there are major issues outside of Alameda Point Partners and the Cities Control, then they would be allowed to take extensions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The last is a Navy delay. So that's if the city is doesn't get the land by the timeline. If we can't actually give them the land to develop it, they don't want to be punished or, you know, for us not being able to give them the land to develop the property, obviously it's very hard to develop the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'property without the land. And so we've allowed for this circumstances. So the city has in the milestones schedule certain dates by which it's expected to provide the land in order to meet all these timelines. And so there would be a delay related to that overall, except for the Navy delay, which isn't subject to the cap, all these'",
        "'speaker_9': 'other delays are subject to the ten year cap on extensions. And really the thought there is, you know, at some point, if we have ten years, for instance, a worst case scenario of some sort of standard force majeure or a war or something like that, we should probably all sit down and figure out whether or not this'",
        "'speaker_9': 'project still makes sense. I mean, this can't go on forever. And so we wanted to cap that. And again, that cap is on the 15 year schedule, not the 20 year term. So it, you know, really only puts the city's kind of outside liability in terms of extensions to the 25 years of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before you continue at 11:00, we need a motion to continue our meeting and it requires three votes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oppose. Oppose passes 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's that's kind of I wanted to to highlight this. If you've got questions about this, it's kind of we've gone over with the NRA, had a lot of information on the terms the price in terms of payment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've talked about that a lot. We haven't really talked about this. We've kind of recently come to an agreement on this. I wanted to put this out there as quickly as possible so that you're not you know, you're getting exposed before the 16th to a lot of the major issues so that there aren't, you know, any major'",
        "'speaker_9': 'surprises on June 16th. So that's why I'm raising it now. Happy to answer questions tonight or moving forward. But I wanted to highlight these issues to you, to the council and the public. So the next thing is really the site, a financing plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What that and what that is is really what they've provided is required in the NRA, that they provide us a financing plan that shows how this project is going to work. The finances of they provided that to us in the form of a land development cash flow analysis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I am going to explain what that is. But really as the city, being the landowner and entering into a public private partnership where you're essentially selling the land to private entity to come in and develop it, it's very important for the city to understand the economics of the deal so that it understands that it's not selling the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'land for too little or that there are the understands that their what what the developers committing to in terms of infrastructure, that you're creating parameters around the economics of the deal and that the city is making sure it's protecting its financial interests.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so the developer provided us their project perform our cash flow analysis, which is an accounting and a comparison of sources and uses of funds. So it's just kind of really just means revenues and expenses over time. And we have that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We had our financial consultant review all the assumptions in that to make sure that it's been vetted independently, that we're not just taking the developer's word for it, and that's really broken out. I'm going to walk through each of these so that people understand how this works with the sources of funds or revenues include mainly land sale'",
        "'speaker_9': 'proceeds. So because it's a land development proforma, it has all the revenue is related to selling land and getting land ready for improved land ready for sale. So the land sale proceeds are essentially the way you calculate these is by looking at how much you think you're going to build or sell something or rent something for.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So how much you're going to sell the townhomes for, for instance, how much is it going to cost you to build them? What is the difference between how much you'll sell them for versus cost? What's that difference? The difference is the land value.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's called a residual land value. That is what's used to determine the land sale proceeds in this model. That's very standard for this type of situation. And then you do that for every product type and it's based on market assumptions about rents.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we're going to I'll talk about those in a sec about sales prices, rents for retail, rents for commercial. And so you had in your packet assumptions about all of those things as well, because it's important for in order to value land, you need to understand what ultimately the land is going to be used for and the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'value of it. And so that's all built into this model, the other revenue source. To tell me that I'm going too fast. But, you know, slow down if I'm going too fast or I'm not explaining something clearly, I want to make sure everyone understands this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the other revenue is a public financing mechanism. It's called community facilities district bond or district bond proceeds. You just recently approved this for Alameda Landing. This is a very standard way to you, basically leverage the value of the land to secure bonds, to pay for infrastructure, and then property owners in that area pay a special tax'",
        "'speaker_9': 'essentially in the special taxes. What's used to pay back those bonds for infrastructure? We do assume that in this case that there will be bond proceeds for infrastructure. The also developed equity, although not a true it's not really a revenue, it's a source of funds.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But any time in the proforma that you see that there's a negative so that it revenue or, you know, expenses exceed revenue and there's a negative the developers potentially using equity to pay for those shortfalls in those years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there is money that the developer, they're writing checks to cover shortfalls in years. And so that's part of their are a source of funds to to pay for the development or for the land development uses of funds, essentially expenses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They include pre-development costs. So all the costs of the developer spending out on the development plan, on the negotiation of the DDA, all of the design review applications, you know, the architecture expenses to put the design review applications together and go through the planning process, all those will be considered pre-development costs and they're just what they sound'",
        "'speaker_9': 'like, all the costs that kind of gets you to the point where you can actually develop something and get it entitled that you actually allow and permitted, that you're now allowed to actually build something are considered pre-development costs, land payments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those are in the the staff report. Those are the $5 million for the sports complex, the $10 million ferry terminal payment, $15 million land payment phase, zero activities, site preparation. So this means demolition of buildings. It means any geotechnical remediation to make sure that you mitigate any settlement issues or seismic issues in the land, any grading that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'has to occur then the infrastructure costs. So those those are when we've talked about the $88 million, that's all those parks, the 15 acres of parks, all the roads, all of those infrastructure costs are counted here, professional services, the cost it'll take to actually design the infrastructure and then developer overhead to essentially kind of manage that effort'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is also included. So that's kind of the one on one on land development, cash flow and how it works and what was in your packet. And this is the tool that we use to really try to assess the the economics of the deal continued there's we also want to make sure, as I mentioned, that the city's getting'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a good deal. So how do we determine feasibility of the project? How do we determine whether or not we're getting a fair price for the land and we. We talk about return requirements. So we're and so what we've essentially built into the agreement is the city at some point we agree.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Developer you're taking all this risk, a lot of risk building a lot of infrastructure. You're doing all these things. There's a lot of complexity. So you should be essentially you get the market rate of return, not a guarantee, but you should achieve a market rate of return on your investment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we have to talk about what that market rate of return is. Of course, that's subject to negotiation. But ultimately, the city, at some point, once you've reached your market rate of return, the city wants to participate. This is our land.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've invested a lot of money in the air, the other entitlements, staff time. So we want to start participating. Once you've reached that threshold of market rate return, we want to participate. And so but it's really intended to be a windfall protection.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The city it's in staff's approach to this. We have tried to negotiate a lot of upfront infrastructure. So the sewer line or the ramp, you know, Ralph, our Bazardo extension, try to frontload as much of that because from our standpoint, getting built improvements in early parks, for instance, all those things, Bill Early actually gives us something concrete'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that the community, not just people live in Alameda but all of Alameda can enjoy. So we don't see this as a way to make a ton of money for the city. What this is intended to do is, hey, if you are wildly successful developer, you shouldn't just run away with all these profits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We need to share too, because we've taken risks, we put in money, it's our land. So we need to have some kind of recognition that you're putting in this investment. You get to meet your rate of return. But ultimately, we want to participate in any in any profits above a certain above a certain threshold.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's what this contemplates, is called profit participation. It's again, it's intended to be a windfall protection. Well, we have talked about this is what we're proposing as city shares and profits. Once our main point partners obtains market rates of return of two returns, an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'll explain what those are. You want me?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May I just ask explain what a 1.6 cash flow index is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. So I'm going to let me start with the internal rate of return, because not everyone may know what that is either. And these are going to be kind of high level explanations. And I can if you have other detailed questions, I are consultant here to explain.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But that idea with an internal rate of return as a way to measure profitability over time and essentially taking into consideration the time value of money. So this is kind of one of the only I shouldn't say only one of the most typical way to kind of recognize the fact that a dollar that you get next year'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is not worth the same as a dollar today that there. And so you sort of be able to measure profitability over time is essentially what the internal rate of return return does. And we have said, the developer said and we agree that, you know, given the risk of this project and a lot of the uncertainties you're going'",
        "'speaker_9': 'to, you know, will allow you to reach an 18%. That's a market rate of return of 18%, internal rate of return before we participate. But we also recognize is that they they want to achieve both an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the castle index is a way to essentially compare profitability to equity. So how much they make versus how much they've had to invest, that's a very high level. But that's basically is this kind of really recognizing the relationship between profit and equity investment on the developer's part.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's what that cash flow index measures. And so they in order for the city to start participating, the developer has to meet both of those threshold returns. Now, I want to be clear, there's no guarantee the city is not guaranteeing that they get these all the and that's part of why they get the, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', these rate of returns. And they are what they are is because there's a risk, there's a chance they don't meet those at all. And that risk that something goes wrong and they've invested all this money and, you know, something does happen and they don't get those returned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The city isn't guaranteeing that they get those returns in any way, but once they do, then the city starts participating kind of at an increasing share of the profits. So starting at 18%, assuming they meet the 1.6 cash flow index, the city would start participating about 10% of the profits, and then that goes up over 20%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's 20% profit position, 20 to 30. And then when they hit the 25% IRR, the city would start. Every dollar would be split essentially between the developer and the city. Again, this is all in the DDA. It's it's probably more than people want to know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it's it's a want you to understand that we have tried to really protect the city's interest in terms of making sure the developer doesn't, you know, use the land and develop it and then run off with a bunch of profits.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this will all all of these detailed provisions are in the DDA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just want to say quickly that that's an important point that you just mentioned, because if you take a look at the way that it's structured, I mean, one can conceivably. I envision a scenario where. Where someone hits the air threshold at 22% and suddenly say.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't want to give 30% of the profit. And so there has to be some mechanism where we can evaluate the amount of investment, equity and all that kind of stuff. So that's what we're looking. Among other things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I did forget to say that we have kind of analyze, ah, so what is, is this we've kind of looked at their performance, their cash flow and determined three main things that I think are important to mention.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'One is that they do show that they're achieving a 22% IRR that is, we believe, a feasible project. So we believe that what they're proposing is feasible financially given the assumptions that are that are in there. We also think it's important to mention that, you know, we don't we don't think there's a excess land value.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, there's kind of methods that they're given. We've kind of maxed out with the infrastructure that's being proposed here in the land. But the $15 million land payments, what's it showing is that there is an excess land value that we're kind of leaving on the table.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the last thing is that based on what the numbers that are in there, we would not be receiving any profit participation based on this. They're very close to meeting the 1.6, but haven't quite yet. And so we're not what they're showing is we think we have a feasible project, but we've kind of maxed it out'",
        "'speaker_9': 'in terms of infrastructure and land payments, and there really isn't any windfall at this point. That doesn't mean there won't be. These are all just assumptions, right. And so ultimately, it's going to be based on what did they actually sell things or how much did it cost to build?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And those will get plugged into the analysis as we move forward with development. So so that we'll be keeping track of that. Every phase will be keeping track of what did you how where did your revenues come out?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where did your costs come out? Let's look at that. Do you owe us any money? Do not. And if after a given phase, it shows that they are meeting those two thresholds and there are excess profits, then we will actually be putting those funds into an account.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We we don't it doesn't mean we get that money necessarily because you got to kind of wait till the end of the project to figure out if how did it all turn out. But we do want is we want those funds segregated into a separate account so so that we don't they don't think of it as their'",
        "'speaker_9': 'money. It's really our money until it's kind of proven that that it's not ours anymore. And so it's just kind of keeping it separate, making it being thought of as is different than money that they're able to use for other things.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's how, how we've structured that. So I want to I know there's been a lot of questions about rents and monthly rental rates, and so I wanted to touch on this. I put this table together. I thought it would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But you look at it's a lot of numbers, but the intent is to really show convert different based on the area median income and it varies by household size what the rents would be for very low, low moderate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the estimated market rents I'm just going to go through these quickly is assuming someone has an income of about 32 to $38000, they'd be paying $854 a month for one bedroom if they met that kind of very low category.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then it goes up the bigger the household size. And so you see for a three bedroom, we are assuming a four person household size that's about $46,000 income. They'd be paying a little over 1100 dollars in rent.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And obviously that goes up there. The project is providing about is providing 16% and these very low, low categories, 9% in the moderate and then the rest as both this is rental rates, but obviously there's townhomes as well, we believe.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what you see here is, I mean, when you look at the moderate incomes at 120% of the area, median income, someone making about, you know, anywhere between 78 and $90,000 would be paying about 2000 their market rent based on the rents that are in the performa that we have peer reviewed and looked at would be paying'",
        "'speaker_9': 'about 20 $600 a month, you know, in a one bedroom apartment. The townhomes obviously are more expensive. The townhomes are looking at more in the $900,000 per unit range. The condos in the second phase are looking at closer to about $700,000 range.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you know, we believe this shows you that there is kind of a spectrum of housing that's being provided to a lot of different income categories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before we move on. Yes. When you look at this chart, how in order to qualify, for instance, of first category below 50%. How many people are in your families for these different categories? Isn't it based on existing households?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I made certain assumptions that the one bedrooms would be one in two person households. This would be 2 to 3 person households. And then they are I'm sorry, this is 3 to 4 and then this is four.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I had to make those assumptions because the way that the area median income is calculated is based on household size. So I made the assumption that again, one bedroom is a 1 to 2 person household, two bedroom is a 3 to 4 and then three bedroom is a four person household and they don't have anything beyond'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Four as a five.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's no five person household, so they only.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Calculated two bedroom. You said 3 to 4, there's 3 to 4. And that's because it's overlapping the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These are overlapping just because they don't they don't have a five person house. So once you hit the four person household, that is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So when I'd like this chart to include but the household members to qualify for these numbers when we see this again. Sure. And then your prices for the condos. But what did you say they were the condos.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They started phase two. So they're priced at about 700,000 per unit. Okay. And this is what's in the performance. I want to be clear on that. Market rents and market prices is that these are market rents and market prices.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if the economy goes down, this could be less as the economy continues to go the way it is, these could be more. So I want to disclose that this isn't they're not guaranteeing these rents at these prices.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is what's in the performa. We have reviewed those versus what we looking at the market. Our independent consultant has looked at them. We think these are reasonable, honestly high end for for what you're seeing in Alameda now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we believe these are reasonable assumptions to have in the financing plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I thought I heard you say that we're building in the old Warren Buffett margin of error just in case something goes wrong and the rents go down. So that because we have fixed allocations and the rents go down or the property values go down, we still want the sports complex and all that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. We factor that in?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, I think what this for the sports complex and the ferry terminal payment, once we transfer the phase one land to the developer, that $50 million is nonrefundable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the on the condos are those one and two bedrooms. But but what you're describing is a condo. Or how many square feet? You know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know if it's on my head.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So that's something else I'd want to know is on condos. What we're talking about?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How many square feet? One one. One two bedroom. What is what is being described as a condo? Oh, okay. And then the three bedrooms. Those are townhomes. Is that what you don't know?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The estimated? We didn't do any for sale on this. I'm just doing because I know there were a lot of questions about rent, so I just didn't rents. I didn't include all I meant when I was talking about the townhomes and condos was to show you that those are those are obviously for people making you know, those'",
        "'speaker_9': 'are given the mortgage payments for a $900,000 townhome. All I meant was that I kind of think of this as this kind of increasing kind of spectrum of housing product that that once after these market rents for apartments, you're getting into people who can afford essentially townhome or condos so that you're providing different product, housing, product or'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a mix of incomes. From the very low to the person who can afford a 900,000 square foot are 9000 $900,000 townhome. Okay. So now. Oh. Okay. So approach to fiscal neutrality. The city in 2003 adopted a fiscal neutrality policy that says we need to make sure that Alameda point essentially doesn't become a burden to the general fund'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that we that we analyze and make sure that the revenues are balanced with the expenses. And these are tax revenues versus city expenditures. So our approach to fiscal neutrality, you know, we have to be thinking talk about this is this is the first development we're not take we're not doing a big master developer for the whole thing'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So we need to be thinking how do we structure this now for this space is, you know, let's set up let's figure out a approach that makes sense that we're going to take and be consistent to take with every development as we go, since we're taking a more incremental approach to development.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we, James Edison and Will, Dan and myself were keeping that in mind as we kind of went through this is let's let's create a methodology essentially for how we evaluate projects out there to make sure we're complying with this and that we're mitigating any impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm going to go over a couple of these are more of a high level kind of approach, and then I'll get into the actual numbers. But obviously let's comply with the policy. Second, we need to actually analyze the net fiscal impacts of Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that means estimate revenues, estimated expenditures when you compare them, are there any adverse or negative impacts when you compare them? We are taking this approach of fiscal neutrality and we are going to be setting kind of mitigations that are going to be kind of set.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so what we want to do, whereas we did an analysis on the fiscal impacts of when we did the entitlements for the entire Alameda point, it was for the entire development envelope. What are the impacts in this case?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We think is very important to be very fiscally prudent and use reasonably conservative assumptions in setting this, because we don't you know, we don't know exact these are projections. We don't know exactly what's going to happen over 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we want to be on the the conservative side in terms of making our assumptions. So we're so and I'll talk about some of those conservative conservative the biggest conservative assumptions we made in this analysis. And then ultimately we need to mitigate the negative impacts through special taxes and or developer payments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'll talk about that in a second. But special tax is basically you approved this recently for Alameda Landing. It's a community facilities district for services. And that means that property owners are paying more in addition to the 1% property tax that goes towards essentially will go toward to the general fund in the road funds to pay'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for maintenance of roads, to pay for fire, to pay for police, and then develop a consistent approach for each incremental development. So developers are kind of clear how this works and the rationale behind it. So what did we do?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'First, we determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire Alameda Point project with all the planned facilities using conservative assumptions. So all plan facilities means a new fire station. It means all of the parks that are out there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we made one pretty major conservative assumption, which is the entire entitlement value. Me point is five and a half is 1425 housing units. Five and a half million square feet of commercial commercial is beneficial to the the to the to the fiscal mainly because you have impacts that your residents are there both during the day and'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the evening. And so they tend to have bigger impacts. And so what we didn't want to do is assume, you know, over 20 or 30 years, we don't know are we going to get 3 million square feet of commercial?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Four and a half, five and a half. So let's be concerned where we are shooting to get as much jobs as possible. But four, since we're setting special taxes and we're trying to be fiscally prudent, let's assume something more conservative.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we actually assumed a three and a half million square feet of commercial and the 1425 housing units. Obviously, if we get five and a half million square feet of commercial, that is better for the general fund and will be will be a benefit to the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But since we're setting these special taxes now, we want to be careful because they're not easy to change. So we want to be careful to have conservative assumptions built into how we estimate them. So that result, when we did that analysis, was a $900,000 deficit, mainly not to the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The general fund was a surplus, but the road fund, a significant new road, Miles. And so when you combine all of the funds that we looked at, the overall deficit was $900,000. Okay? So now we know we've got it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've got an issue when we're using conservative assumptions that we need to mitigate because we need to meet that fiscal neutrality policy. So we need to assign every development, their fair share of that deficit. And the site, a fair share of the 900,000 is $311,000 that they that they have agreed to essentially create a special tax that'",
        "'speaker_9': 'will generate, at buildout $311,000 annually to the general fund to mitigate their portion of these impacts. And those. So that's the second step. The third step. Biz Well, what about in the beginning years when you might have some facilities but not all the development paying revenues and paying the special tax?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Are there kind of temporal impacts or impacts in the beginning and over time? So let's do another analysis and let's look. In this case, we estimated the net fiscal impacts of each incremental development, obviously in this case site a by phase.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so what we looked at was phase one, face to face three. In phase one, there are negative impacts even after they pay their share of special tax.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yashar Can I ask you quick question just before you get to the the different phases? So in the I'm in that paragraph in the staff report, it's on page seven and the section is Results of Fiscal Impact Analysis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in the first paragraph down near the bottom is the sentence that so it talks about the development in Alameda point is actually expected to generate a net positive impact on the city's general fund of a certain amount, net positive impact on the city's library fund and a net adverse impact on the city's street related funds of'",
        "'speaker_4': '$1.2 million. And my question was. Explain why the city's street related funds are negatively impacted if the developer is paying so much in backbone infrastructure costs.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, because those are what they're paying for. And background infrastructure costs are the capital. This is the cost to maintain the roads and to keep them at a certain level maintained at a certain level. And there are a lot of roads there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are a lot of bike facilities or a lot of roads. And so we've estimated all of the different kind of road miles and sidewalks, linear feet and all of that, and determine what it would cost to maintain all those roads.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And there aren't when you look at the street funds, there aren't a lot of dedicated street revenues to to do that. And so in this case, when you combine all those little bridges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No toll bridges.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, exactly. So it is an impact. So you've got a lot of facilities and not a lot of dedicated revenues to that. So it creates it creates an impact, I think.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So Councilmember Odie and I were just talking about the the net impact and we were just basically distributing the net impact of $300,000 in number to over 800 units. Granted that it's also going to be distributed over commercial as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But just just for math sake, right. That comes out to be $375 to which for residents to which I, I thought that the reason why it's kind of low is because you're distributing the net impact over 800. Whereas if you distributed the total impact, it'd be something else.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Correct. Right. I mean, if you because you're mainly netting out all your other revenues. And so it's not just the cost, but you're saying the general funds going to your property tax for sure. You're going to get transfer tax over time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You get sales tax. We take into consideration all those revenues as well and then compare and then essentially compare them to costs. And how do those compare?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the reason why that's important to mention is because the Bayport. They're paying $1,000 a year on for MSD. Mm hmm. And all you need to do for those who are so interested in the Internet, just go to their county assessors and you'll see that there's $1,000 for each residents.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's the that's basically the CFD MSE for, for Bayport, whatever it is for Alameda landing. I don't know. But.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you know, I guess my question was, you know, what do we estimate? You know, each parcel that annual tax is going to be or do we not know that now or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We don't know that exactly. I mean, we ultimately it's it's. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, we, you know, we it's hard because you can it does depend on how you allocate it to commercial versus residential and how we do that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the developer, in some cases, commercial development is actually much more sensitive to special taxes than than residential. The way that we kind of structured is that what we said to the developer, we went through an $11,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're going to you're going to have a special tax. Certainly your townhomes are going to have those on them. You know how you figure out how you apportion that special tax. We're going to figure out and you're going to come tell us because we're going to end up approving a CFD ultimately for that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what we what we care about most is that we're assured that $311,000 a year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, I just was, I think one, I want to clarify one thing. So I think the situation where Bayport was that and this is the genesis of the fiscal neutrality policy is that Bayport at the time was part of redevelopment area where the or the baseline was zero or pretty close to zero.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So everything was was basically tax increment. So that's why you had to capture the for the full value. Whereas I think you're doing your analysis where, where there's some property tax that's coming down Alameda solar so that the 1% ad valorem and the Alamo is 25% share is coming to us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's right. But then there's still there's still a discrepancy and that's why we add the brackets.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. And. Yeah, exactly. And I think we actually ran a sensitivity because the state has approved things like the infrastructure financing districts. And so we actually ran a sensitivity. If you we don't assume any of these or infrastructure financing districts for that, which is really a reapportionment of that 1% ad valorem tax, if you did this impact'",
        "'speaker_9': 'would be much bigger and you'd have to mitigate a much bigger amount. And again, I mean, this these are conservative assumptions that we tried to make throughout the analysis. If you were to if you if we're successful getting five and half million square feet of commercial, there won't be any impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, that's what we estimate. There wouldn't be any where we want to be conservative, make sure we're being fiscally prudent. And so we've assumed something that we think's more realistic in the 20 year time frame, the three and a half million square feet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So let me let me just keep going, but feel free to interrupt. And this is good. It's. So number three is to estimate the net fiscal impact of each incremental development by phase. So for let's just look at side eight and let's look at what facilities are actually built at the time CIDA is built.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're not going to assume the fire station. The fire station is not part of the project. It's not necessary. So we're not going to penalize them. The full costs are or pro-rata share of the fire station. They do have to pay an average cost of fire expenditures because they're using fire services.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we're actually going to just look at the facilities that are actually there inside A to to to try to estimate whether or not there are any kind of incremental or temporal impacts on the general fund that we need to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And these would be mitigated through some sort of you know, it wouldn't be through a special tax, be some sort of payment or source because it's kind of a temporary impact. We did this and then we also compared it to one offset it with one time revenues, which are really property transfer taxes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'll show you the analysis on this, but based on pretty significant property transfer tax on just the ownership residential really offsets those impacts in that first year and I'll show you the numbers. But so we we start recommendation is there's no additional mitigation that's required for site A and then we also, you know, this is something'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that happens in other cities is if is there a single user that generates a significant amount of tax revenue that could present risk that if it does, it gets delayed or doesn't happen. So for instance, you know, a major retail user in this case, we have no kind of single user retailer that's huge.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That would be generated. But like it out in L.A. would be like a target or something like that. Here we don't have that, but we do have a hotel and hotels generate pretty significant transient occupancy tax. So we did actually take the hotel out and it build out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, there are no there's no there's no impact. There's still site is positive. And I should say our number three overall a build out site A is positive. It generates more revenue to the general fund than it does expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I want to make that clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. May I take you back to number one under this approach to fiscal mitigation? And so that was determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire on midpoint development. And at the end, it says fiscal analysis in exhibit nine estimates its impact will be a negative annual impact of 871,000 at build out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm. How how how many years is this estimated deficit expected to last? Is that just the year we get to build out?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Or when it when it's at build out, it means build out. So it means kind of the assumption is, you know, that that could be going forward. Going forward. But that doesn't I mean, again, there are a number of factors that could influence that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The more commercial you get, the more retail sales tax. If there's a major business to business user, you know, there are other factors that could play in here. But we've tried to be conservative in our assumptions. And so that's where that's right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That that's kind of at build out what the impact would be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The annual impact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I appreciate that. Is this a deficit page from the general fund? Where is it? Where does it come from?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the deficit. So let me go to the next slide. So the the deficit, if you take all those funds revenues, the property tax, sales tax, utility users tax, we've estimated all of those expenditures, fire, police, everything. When you kind of net those, you know, compare those, you've got a deficit of the 900,000 that you're talking about'",
        "'speaker_9': 'that is and then site A has to mitigate its fair share. And so it's actually paid through a special tax so the general fund. Every development is going to have to pay their fair share of that 900,000. So every development that comes into the city, we're going to say, all right, here's the impacts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You pay your fair share. The idea is and the methodology is that at the end of the day, once it's all developed, you're going to have sufficient funds to cover any deficit. So that there would be no impact.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our hope is that everything's wildly successful and all the taxes are even more than we think. And, you know, you're collecting honestly. I mean, you're collecting special tax revenue and you're not having a negative impact because it's much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But since we don't know and we have to determine it now, we want to be conservative and use conservative protections going forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this is the summary of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh yeah. Member already.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. So. See if I just understand this correctly. So we're expecting transfer tax and property tax in. The transient hotel tax. And so we're expecting that to come in, in, you know, 17 or 18 or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're starting to do all this. And we've already pretty much assigned that revenue to expenditures already. That kind of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, it's just that it comes you know, it's not is some of these revenues you can track to to a specific property like a property tax you kind of know. But it just starts your revenues will start going up your expenses, too, because you'll be having more calls for service.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So things are it's it's not going to happen overnight. Right. But you're going to. Sure, you're going to I mean, probably what you're going to see first are the revenues, right? Because you're going to really start to see a hit and you're going to get property transfer tax revenues.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When all those first townhomes get sold right away, you're going to get a big hit and you'll see the numbers that we've estimated. And then once they once the property tax get on the rolls, you start to see increases in property tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But over time, you're going to start to see increases in calls for service and other things and expenditures. So it's not that it's a sign, it's just that you're going to gradually have increases in revenues and increases in expenditures.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then just for my. Newness at this. So is that going to just sit in the general fund or are we segregating that in like the base re-use or.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, it will be the general fund. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have to be very careful when we get this in that we don't spend it because we know that, you know, it's pretty much spoken for, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. I mean, it's going to the general fund and we need to be aware that there are going to be increases in expenditures over time as well. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So this is I know this is a big tale, but I want to walk through it quickly. So this is the analysis of site. So this was kind of the overall how do we set that special tax? Because we're going to set that special tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's very difficult to change it once it's kind of in place. And so we're going to require that this amount that they are obligated to pay this amount at build out every year. Then we say again, going back to our methodology.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's look at what are the impacts on a temporary basis are. Well, let's look at it by phase by phase for site. When you look at site in total, we're expecting with mitigation that the impacts will be positive to the general thought about $700,000, but they're still paying the 311 every year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we think their project, based on the facilities that are in place now or at the end of phase of site, there will be some benefits to the general fund over time. But let's look at it by phase, because things, services and facilities are kind of lumpy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so you do see that in that first phase there is kind of a net impact of 500,000. The fiscal mitigation we're estimating would be 200,000. So you've got a temporal impact in that first year phase one, but you're collecting $1.1 million in transfer taxes and then the transfer taxes in phase two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is just for for sale residential. So you may there may also be transfer taxes for other uses, but those are speculative because they may just hold some of those the commercial properties they'll probably hold and not transfer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we just assumed, you know what, no transfer tax from that, just the townhomes, essentially, and then the condos and townhomes in the second phase and you get a pretty big hit. And so staff's recommendation is that this these hits and transfer tax more than cover any temporal or temporary deficits that you may have in some of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the earlier phases.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before you move on. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This. I just want to make a comment that phase three kind of aligns with the purpose smoothing problems that we have. When we go back to the our general fund discussions back a couple of weeks ago. So one of the questions I had is, did your estimates?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To set the tax, anticipate or graduate at the same rate that is driving. When we look at the general fund projections on a downward slope.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that the special tax is estimated to escalate CPI every year and it has to be tied it's tied to actual cost of maintenance or expenditures of maintenance. So and it will escalate over time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But not the municipal service tax.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the municipal service tax will escalate at the CPI.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it has I'm not going to say an inherent structural defect built in in a way that it doesn't track at the same escalation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doesn't contributions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, right. The the inflation factor will be CPI as opposed to, you know, a city municipal expenditure rate or something like that. It'll be tied to CPI, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you had Amir. One more. What kind of request? Phase one is 15 through 19, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then it looks like the bulk of the sales are in 17. I mean, is there some way when when we look at this, we can kind of see, you know, by by fiscal year what the estimated impact on on our general fund is as opposed to buy phase?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. So we can we can break it out. I mean, we can do that. It's a it's we just make assumptions by year. The only reason we didn't do that was just because we didn't want to give a sense, a little bit of false precision, because some of it is, you know, you know, but we can do'",
        "'speaker_9': 'it. And if it's analysis you guys would like to see, we're happy to do it. We just, you know, in some ways. Exactly, you know, trying to estimate exactly what's going to be in every year. It starts to get a little, you know.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, based on those assumptions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, two and three, you know, that's going out way far in the future. But I think for for phase one, which is, you know, the first five years, which yeah, you know, we're going to be, you know, this council's going to be setting the budget for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it would just be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And we can do that. And we can also show you that the transfer taxes, kind of the one time transfer taxes for the for those years as well. So, sure, we can. Absolutely. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm wondering what are your assumptions on your for sale residential? How many of the units are for sale? The residential?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What's in the proforma? So it's, you know, I can pull up the numbers but it's anyone, remember. So I don't remember the exact number but it's whatever is in the perform I think it's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 39 townhouse down home.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How many? 139 townhomes. That value sale of 888,000 range. Mm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or that's.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's the Willesden report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Exhibit 10 to.'",
        "'speaker_9': '70. So 270 for sale. For sale 274 sale.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Total of. Is about. And that's your phase one. Or is that just overall 270.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Overall for yourself. But but we and we assumed value in tax from all of the units and all the commercial. The only place we kind of limited to for say residential is on the property transfer tax because those are the ones.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's what I'm looking at and trying to figure out how you made that calculation.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is not below market rate, then this is all market rate, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, but that has to be a transfer tax on the the rental building because someone will buy it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm James Edison from Will, then financial services consultant to the city. So what we assumed was so for the recent offer sale, which I think some of the moderate or also some of the moderate or for sale and then the market rate for sale, those are the only units we assumed in what we assumed was a the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'city's transfer tax rate, you know, the 12, $12 per thousand valuation. The reason it's a big hit in is because when the first sale happens, every single unit has a transfer tax. After that, it happens as that as a unit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it just depends on people's lives. And, you know, that can vary quite a bit. But when when the initial sale happens, when that first family moves in, that means every single unit results in transfer tax. And so it's a it's a big number right out of the gate, but it only happens once.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not annual. I mean, it's annual in a sense. It it may occur over several years, but we've calculated for the phase that's sort of a one time payment essentially on the commercial. It really depends on the disposition of the property.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, if someone purchases the property, I mean, you can have a transfer tax at that point. But then if they didn't develop it from there and, you know, build their building and do the rest of it, their assessed value will change.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, a reassessment will happen, but there won't be any transfer necessarily. So you won't have a transfer tax. You may see those. But in the interest of being conservative, we didn't assume any because they might not happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'When I was a counselor, you asked about we did assume in the annual cash flow. So this is I mean, those are the one time expenses this row here. When we calculated the model, we do assume a certain amount of all the units in the commercial transfer every year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But it's a small percentage here. You're talking about all of them, 100% of the for sale units transfer. So you get that big hit over time over on the model, we assume every year some portion of the unit, some portion of commercial turns over and you do get a transfer tax revenue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You just don't get that big hit like you do in the beginning. So we do assume property transfer tax revenue over time as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think that's it. I'm happy to answer any any question I have, Joe. I think Joe answered with important point partners wants to just say a couple of things. And then if you have more questions about the fiscal, though, or the financial, you know, I can answer those now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you. And is that so. Let's see. Down on the. Um. Page eight. There's the reference that the tax. My question. Let me just find it. Well, my question is, why is the tax burden higher for residents than for commercial 1.9% versus 1.8%?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. That's a good a good question. And so when negotiating the in and the term she was attached to the NRA, there's commercial uses tend to be much more sensitive to special tax, special taxes and whereas residences, you know, honestly, we all I mean, we don't it's it's just a reality where people don't pay as much'",
        "'speaker_9': 'attention and they're just not as sensitive to how much of a tax burden there is. And so you're allowed you're able to burden residential users a little more without seeing an impact to value. And again, we kind of use these numbers that are in there, the 1.8, 1.9 to do the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the end of the day, what we care about is now that we've done all the technical work we care about, is it $311,000 if they decide they want to kind of prepay that on some of the commercial because they want to lower the burden and they want to put more on the residential.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, we can you know, we're kind of allowing some flexibility because now we've kind of done the analysis to figure out what we think those amounts should be. And then and it's not just the municipal services special tax, but it's the team plan and the operations and transit services that they're funding.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's flood control maintenance, flood control reserve. So there are a number of different things that the city is saying. Our priorities that we want to be collecting funds for from this development to make sure that we're being prudent about maintaining the resources we have out there and providing the services that are so key to the transportation program'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, we don't have any speakers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Which I think I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You want to sites with a search.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. Sorry. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, members of the council. Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. We're very pleased to get our planning board approval last week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Having 29 supporters with varying messages.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A lot of new faces, you know, and we will continue that outreach with the community. There's been a lot of talk about housing, but I want to be clear. You know, we haven't lost our focus about a lot of the things we've heard from the community from the very outset about what the community wants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Clearly, jobs and the things businesses need, you know, the the parks, the amenities, the housing, the rental, you know, those are things, you know, business. I think this project, you know, we've talk about jobs, but it's also important what it will do for creating jobs at the base, affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have Linda Mammoliti here tonight. I'd like to get her to say a few words, too, about some of the affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, with the housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, you know, there's enough here to support the goals to pay for a lot of the things that are in this proforma, that, you know, the things we want. You know, there will be a diversity of housing types.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's been a lot of questions about different housing types. But we have a, you know, enough here. You know, we using, you know, size of product, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To target a lot of different parts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the market between affordable and market rate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've clearly tried to tailor this to, again, demographic that, you know, is going to support transit, that we want to support the retailers, the amenities which are so critical to attracting business. And it's very resource efficient. You know, certainly in our time here of water shortage, I think what's very important with the with site is the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Capital investment and the message they.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will send and the importance of of this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we've had a chance now to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Meet with all the businesses out at the point and talk to them about their business and their futures. We've talked to other businesses that have expressed interest in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our project and other things we're working on. You know, it's very clear that a lot of the businesses out there, from Nortel to a county power even right speed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A new tenant, you know, making very minimal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Investments in their buildings. And it's largely due to uncertainty about infrastructure. And so I think this, you know, getting city underway is going to send a real strong message to the capital markets, going to send.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A real strong message to these companies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to send a real strong message to good businesses that we want to locate here. I think, you know, the housing is going to support good transit, both infrastructure and services. And we want to be a catalyst for expanding this throughout the rest of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again, I'm going to have Elinda talk a little bit about affordable. But, you know, we really want to realize what renewed hope, you know, has achieved with the 25% affordable housing. We've done some preliminary jobs analysis here. And, you know, with site development, we're looking at about 3700.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Construction jobs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That will translate into about 185.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Million in wages. And, you know, we have in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In our DDA, you know, we're targeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': '25%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Minimum, you know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Toward, you know, local Alameda residents, Alameda County, and also going to be working with the collaborative for apprenticeships. So, you know, we hope to see a lot of those wages stay right here. You know, permanent jobs, you know, based on the mix of businesses, hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Retail and, you know, the innovation, especially manufacturing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looking at about 1700 permanent jobs, of course, sales tax. TOTTY Given the blend of commercial uses, we are making good progress on a project labor agreement with the building trades and we're hopeful we'll have that wrapped up in the next week or so.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you know, is part of our commitment to bringing jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through the lease structures that we've negotiated as part of the DDA, we are committing to at least getting one of those buildings that are in phase in our phase three, getting that redeveloped and activated with phase one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Building 117, about just under 100,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So again, want to, you know, and a lot of talk about the housing, but clearly want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Talk about the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Many benefits that come from this project. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Linda mann Bellini with Eden Housing to say a few words about the affordable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Members of the council. As Joe said, I'm the president of Eden Housing. I'm happy to be here. I think this is actually in Eden's long term history, one of the best projects that we've been able to participate in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to tell you why we don't often get asked to be in developments like this in this percentage. Frequently, the other inclusionary ordinances that we work with have 10 to 15%. They never have 25%. And I think the percentage of affordable housing here is actually quite exciting and really exceptional.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would applaud the city for that and for that agreement. We're very excited because we can serve a range of affordability with this development and we can serve those who are most in need at the low end, but also take the rents up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As you saw in the slide that Jennifer put up, we have the ability to create create apartments that are significantly more affordable than the market can provide. And we think it's actually very important that these be rental. And that's largely because the developer here is investing a lot in the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eden could never be in a project like this and pay for that kind of an infrastructure investment. So the fact that we get to piggyback on that is really important, but it also gives us the opportunity when we do rental housing to leverage the new funds that might be coming from the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I want to say a very special thank you for the yes endorsement vote tonight on 1335 and 35. Both of those are very likely. Both of them are sources that are going to be directed in large part to rental housing and that they will be able to be leveraged on a project like this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Cap and trade also has a requirement for affordability that is significant. And so we think that it's really important that the affordable be mostly rental housing because we think that that's really the thing that's going to be the most successful financially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Think it's the best use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of what is in essence subsidy from the larger land development. We can serve more households by doing rental housing than you could if you were doing single family. So for example, if you were to sell a house at $900,000 and make that house affordable to someone at $300,000, the subsidy for that one house would be $600,000 for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one household. For Eden, I could build three houses for that kind of subsidy and maybe four if they were one bedroom. So I think it's just a better use of the subsidy dollars coming from the developer for for us to to do rental.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I did want to comment on that because I know there were some questions about that in other places and we're really excited about this. Honestly, I Eden won the Jack Kemp Award from ULI nationally last year for a big master planned development.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I'm now judging this year for that same competition. And I would tell you this is that kind of a development. It is the kind of development that will get national attention that really has a wide range of affordability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It affords the folks at the lowest end of the spectrum the opportunity to participate in all of the amenities that you're building. And that's really important. A lot of the developments that we work in, a lot of other communities, they'll take a check from the developer and go build it somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But this is really important to be built here. And so I just want to thank you for that because I think this is a really important aspect of the project, and I'm happy to answer any questions about affordability because I know there have been some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are there any other speakers point f it down with the presentation now. All right. Council members, vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, you know, I'll start out by saying that I've never been a fan of a town center. Um, I think I've been clear about that. One of the considerations, though, that I do have, and I wanted to make sure that we can verify that other action of the Planning Board was to take the old north housing and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'return the housing that's allocated to north housing to what was agreed with in the Navy in 29 at 415 units. And I just want a quick confirmation that when is that going to be? Fortified and established.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. So that will be coming back to the Council on June 16th.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the same time. And that has a net effect of taking 800 units off the northern waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that and project labor agreement, I think are two key, key things for me. I do have some other other questions and not questions, more comments and direction and things I'd like to see. One of them is I appreciate in-house in coming up here and being a participant in this, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was reading the affordable housing section in the overview of the DDA and that is separate and it's not incorporated in and what we see here in the and these are from our numbers and there is a term in there that talks about their ability or their maximize their potential for obtaining financing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'd like. The risk of them not obtaining sufficient financing not to be on the city. But to be on the developer because part of the promise and we when we hear the input from people part of the promise of this is to deliver 25% of the 800 units as affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_2': '128 of those are at Eden. And if they're depending on other other sources of of revenue to build these, including state funds. I don't want to get to the end of phase one and they don't have the funds and we not deliver the housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that risk should be on the developer and the city can do everything it can to help. But this is this is the promise. And that's what a lot of the support where a lot of the support is coming from.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd also like to see. A little more meat behind the leasing and inclusion of jobs in phase one with some milestones because people are going to be living. One thing that's clear is they're going to be townhouses built.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's going to be an apartment built or apartments built, and eventually they'll be condos built. People will be living there. And one of the best ways to mitigate those people not driving up to the tube or trying to take a bus through the tube or a BRT is to have jobs close by.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the. The issue of. Having. The ferry. And I've seen that the ferry over the period of this discussion has been reduced to $10 million. And whether or not that's enough to build a ferry terminal. And then whether or not the fairies will come if we build the terminal, I think is still a risk because that's a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'promise that's out there that we're going to have a fairy. But I haven't seen a commitment yet from Wheaton to run a fairy. If we build a terminal and I don't know if $10 million can build the terminal, it doesn't sound like it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's another risk that we have in front of us that I'd like to push the push in another direction and it falls under transportation. There are a couple of things that we have to make sure that we do reality based transportation demand management.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think one of that demands that we address the issue that keeps popping up, that there is only going to be one additional cars through the tubes at peak time. And whether or not that's true or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think it's true. But we have to get some numbers that are bona fide that say what what it's like today so that we can project it out on what we have to mitigate as these units become populated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that is extremely important to have credibility when we're charging people who are going to be buying these units a substantial amount of money to transport them. Off the island if they have to work off the island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then lastly, I mentioned the project labor agreement. I think it's very important to have these jobs local and I'm glad progress is being made. And that truly is a condition, I think that we have to stand by because it's public land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's been used for this project. So those those are my comments and my input for tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have a clarifying question on the statement about the reality based transportation planning and beside of you come up. Okay. I have definitely read in the newspaper from a local commentator that somewhere it said that Alameda Point development is only going to put one more car through the tube.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wasn't my understanding of what the report actually said. Is it not something more like the capacity only has room for one more to one more car through the tube? Do you want to state it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Completely that I am.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. I mean, the Aluminum Point Environmental Impact Report studied, I think 32 intersections, the impacts to 32 intersections in in Alameda and then a number in Oakland as well. And what it showed was that there will be, you know, with or without made a point, there are going to be significant impacts given all the regional growth.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Aluminum point, as you know, there are impacts that Alameda Point contributes to. There are significant impacts. No one is saying that there's only one Alameda point generating one car. That's just not right. Absolutely. Will be generating cars. What happens is what that what that person.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Kind of taking data. What it shows is that the tubes are essentially what kind of confirms and in a lot of ways what a lot of us know already, which is the tubes are generally essentially reaching capacity. Now, when you add more cars, what ends up happening, this is what you see in the analysis that was done'",
        "'speaker_9': 'is when you add more cars on the Western people that are driving from the, you know, the middle of the island or Eastern don't go into the tubes anymore. The tubes are capacities. What we would all do if you know intuitively they're going to they now then go to intersections on the East End.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so where you actually see a lot of the impacts in the traffic impact analysis are on the eastern around the Park Street Bridge, around the other crossings because people who would be kind of driving into the tubes today, let's say as the regional growth occurs, other growth occurs in Alameda, the tubes are going to reach capacity'",
        "'speaker_9': '. And that's what the models are saying, is that your tubes only have so much traffic, you know, in there. And so what you see is they actually have spreading of traffic and then traffic that's diverting to other parts of the island.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you for that clarification, because it upsets me every time I see this reported in the newspapers, not so much reporting, but sometimes as an opinion piece and sometimes it gets front page coverage. But I just want us on the council when we're talking to the public to to have an understanding of what that means.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, of course, it ties into so much of what we've discussed already tonight about the need for getting the funding that we have the ability to apply for through the Alameda County Transportation Commission, both the federal grants and the state matching grants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're not burying our head in the sand. We're saying we do need to look at another model, which is giving people the opportunity to live and work in the same area and getting people who work out of the area, out of their single occupancy vehicles and on to public transit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we have to make that possible. And we heard some very good opportunities tonight that are coming to us the best rapid transit and increased funding for ferry and other public transportation. Thank you there for that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Want to add on that very important point about the increase of traffic from Alameda point as it flows, particularly through the outbound Posey Tube in the morning. On the when we decided the air, we actually discussed and evaluated that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it was largely because when I was looking at the appendices, I did, in fact take a look at the circles that they had, the schematics and kind of said, okay, look, there's there seems to be something odd about the certain number of of cars going through the posi tube in one scenario relat.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then when you look at the cars going through the Posey tube, in another scenario, there didn't seem to be that much and there wasn't that much for the reason given by MZ Art this afternoon. This evening. And it was given back then when we discussed the air.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, what we also did, though, is we also did back then when we discussed the air and said.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we're.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Wrong? So back in 2014, what we did in accepting the air and also doing the MIP or the mast master infrastructure plan for Alameda Point, we also had a failsafe just in case something didn't happen, didn't go as we had wanted to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is part of the discussion. That is part of the of the things that came out of the whole nip in the air for Alameda point discussion for that happened in 2014. So let it not be said that this council did not evaluate that very specific information that that is now, you know, gaining currency here in'",
        "'speaker_5': '2015. We discussed it in 2014 and however imperfectly, we made some policy decisions with regard to that. So if I maybe I'll just continue with some of my points. Okay. My points for tonight based upon this is again on transportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much for the changes that I saw. Once again, I love that 15 minute headway for the shuttle. I know it's not this answer to everything. And I know, you know, consultants said not to not to glom onto it, but I did.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But also, the other changes that that were made was to make sure that, you know, we'll talk about three things about the shuttle possibly stopping at one or some other place. So I'm glad to see that language in the in the team.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think in going through the materials for this evening, I think that the my quick notes that I had was make sure that we have language that protects us and our interests. And our interest, for example, are like the sports complex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Make sure that we have a language that protects us in our interests in this development in the event of a recession. Now, everything that is had indicated tonight is that that will be part that is part of the DDA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So remember, she talked about, you know, economic force majeure and all those kind of things, because we do have however the project goes in terms of the sales, whether the commercial sales or whether the rental or whether the single family I mean, the the sales for those are subject to the markets at the time and markets at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the time could be down. So however, the on the revenue side, those things go. We ourselves as a city want to see some cost that we want. We want to see costs like that, like the sports complex. So we don't want to do you know, we don't want to sacrifice those.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think every everything that MDOT has indicated is that we've taken that into account. We also want to take into account the fact that, you know, we're going to hire more police officers, we're going to have more more fire people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we might even, one assumes, some of those costs ahead of time. For example, you can't have half a half of a fire station. Right. So so, you know, you have to make a decision. So as we assume these costs, we want to make sure that we've factored in, you know, well, what if, you know, all of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the property values go down because we have all these assumptions with regard to how revenues offset the costs and we have all these assumptions with regard to the impact fee that we're going to use. So but everything that to me suggests that they they're modeling that into into a DDA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Land banking, as always. One of the big issues that we learned from the Bay Port Alameda landing. So hopefully that will make sure to have a discussion about that things that I also want to take a look at a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Flushing out the corporate entity of who will be working with. A lot of times you want to know, you know, the corporate entity with who you're working with just in case things go wrong and you know, you just want to know things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I like the that the extension payments that Miz was talking about. I just I think the question that I just wrote here was, are they automatic, though? And if we could just flesh that out later on. And also the mechanism, as I indicated earlier, kind of understanding the mechanisms for how we're going to score the IRR'",
        "'speaker_5': ', because a lot of that is a function of, you know, what we think are the costs that the developer or whomever is assuming as an equity investment need of a project. So, you know, I mean, we got we got to make sure that we understand that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guess the last thing I have in mind is from the outset is I had indicated a variety of things that we're going to be deciding on on June 16th. One of the things that we as a council might want to think about is including the development plan itself.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the only reason why I would include the development plan, which was discussed by the planning board and voted on by the planning board. The only reason I would raise the possibility of including the development plan as part of the June 16th discussion is if for no other reason, for its ceremonial reasons.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, it is after all, you know, it's a it's a development plan for a key part of Alameda Point, which has taken us decades literally to get to this point. So from a ceremonial perspective, you know, to say hats off to former Mayor Withrow, former mayor opposed to former Mayor Johnson and and Maria Gilmore and all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the previous councils, it's altogether possible that maybe we should have the council at least vote on the development plan as opposed to leaving it just to the Planning Board as part of our June 16th discussion. So largely for ceremony reasons, I get that that the development plan would probably be woven into the DDA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand that, you know, but we might have it. Think about that if for no other reason than ceremonial reasons as to why it should be included. Well, as my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mary Spencer. I want to thank the missus and the other presenters in Ms.. Madeleine. If I'm saying your name correctly, that was really inspiring to hear from you. And to that, the project we're aspiring to do at its site is it sets the bar high, even by the projects you've seen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I like that. I we got a lot of external correspondence from various people actually supporting one of the letters. I was really impressed with and I'm just going to read it tonight. So it's, it's in their record in heard by the public because I think it really sums up a lot of of why we're doing what'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we're doing. So it says my husband Dan Corea and I are Olympians and retired employees of NASA Alameda. I was on the first brand committee for years working to decide what the best could and should become after closure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Dan worked his last year performing hazardous waste cleanup around the base. I spent my last years in the active center in building one or one, helping people find and apply for new jobs. Dan and I recently went on a tour of what is planned for the Seaplane Lagoon site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We were filled with hope at what could be done with this tired old base of ours. I remember. I remember when it seemed that the task of bringing the base back to life was just too daunting. Now we see that not only can new life happen, but this plan for society could honor our former base.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Incorporation of existing buildings into the development plan would allow our history to continue into the future. At the same time, we have been watching as too much development seems to be changing. Alameda from the community we once knew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We think we have gone too far in changing neighborhoods that were not seeking their change. But we still think that the one place that does cry out for development is our old base. The proposed development there will not take away from what Alameda is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is development that is sorely needed to allow that crumbling base to become something better than it is now. This is a plan for new life. We endorse it. Carol Fairweather and Dan Corea. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, Odie.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll try to be brief, because I think almost every comment that I've wanted to say has been said already. So she ate my my colleague's comments. I just want to focus on a couple of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One, I'm glad that there's progress on the play, and hopefully I'd like to see that resolved by now. But I hope that you're getting into the nitty gritty of the negotiations and are able to report back soon that that's been taken care of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was encouraged by the the acceleration of the commercial development. The point was made about we need to make sure we get jobs there sooner rather than later. And that I don't think we can underestimate the importance of the north housing realignment of of housing in our in a housing element.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think I really want to commend the vice mayor for his leadership on this issue, because what it what this allows us to do is to consider this project in a way such a way that, you know, we're not adding housing to our housing element, where we're going to be able to consider this within the context'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of our housing element and not go over and build. You know, I guess I would call extra housing. So again, very, very strong and effective leadership on that issue by our vice mayor in bringing this this whole realignment idea to the council and to the staff back early in the year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So. That's basically my my comments. I'm glad that we've finally seen the financials. You know, we we saw the pro forma and closed a while ago. But I'm glad that, you know, the public now has an opportunity to review those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, this is, you know, where other projects have struggled when the public has had an opportunity to drill down and pick apart the financials. So I hope they they take the time. I mean, we've had 12 days already, but hopefully the public will continue to look at these critically and, you know, provide comments to us'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I still have yet to hear a speaker at council opposed to this. So if you're out there, hopefully we don't hear someone come and say we need more time. You know, we haven't talked about this enough because there has been ample opportunity both at the planning board, other commissions and council, you know, to voice concerns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I hope we don't we don't see a parade of people telling us that, because I think that's a little disingenuous after after all the hard work is that you have done and staff has done. So that's kind of my thoughts where we are right now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate the comments and the presentation. And I have received emails from people that are adamantly opposed to any housing, especially on because that would flow through the two. I think they are out there and I and and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Personally in regards to traffic, that is a big issue of mine. When I look at this, though, it's things that the prior counsel gave this exclusive negotiate an agreement to this company with the 800 homes, which means. I am looking for how the traffic will be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see this property as a gift to our meetings large. As much as I want jobs and to have something done at the point, I think that at the end this has to benefit all our meetings. A comprehensive transit has to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm concerned that, you know, I voted against hiring a consultant to look at that. I think we have to address this bus shuttle transit. And I know we have our business allies that have already said this sooner rather than later.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The traffic through the tube is too much. This cannot within our ability, it cannot contribute any more to that. And yes, it does flow across the island all the way across the island. It is a serious problem. So how do you put an 800 homes and have it have as low impact as possible on our roads?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we have to be very mindful of that. And I'm not sure we're there. I'm just going to raise these issues and I'm hoping everyone can be thinking about this. How are we really doing this? Barry The ferry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I checked Richmond. They said their ferry was 42. They were just. That just happened 40 to 50 million. And that's on line is what they're estimating for their terminal. And we're talking about 10 million. I don't know what the deal is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we have our dredging costs of I feel like that is very immature unless in there's someone's got this information. What is the deal is we they're going to put in how much money. How much is the dredging?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this 10 million going to make a difference? And then I'm going to ask this question of staff, how much parking is being said, set aside for the ferry right there by the ferry. How many spaces are there?'",
        "'speaker_9': '400 spaces.'",
        "'speaker_0': '400? Okay. How many cars do we think? Well, I'm going to compare that to Harbor Bay. Do you know how many spaces are there or how many? We have a big problem at the Harbor Bay Ferry right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you have any idea how many spaces are there?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't know. Do you know?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or the main street ferry? Do we know how many cars?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Main Street? I think it's like 700.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if Main Street is 700 and this is 400, then that's significantly less.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Than it is. But we're expecting a lot of people to actually live and walk to the ferry or ride their bikes to the ferry and other things. So we're while we're one of the reasons we're putting it in the seaplane lagoon, at the heart of the development is to try to get all the, you know, people moving'",
        "'speaker_9': 'there that want to take ferries so that they won't be driving. It doesn't mean the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Will be people driving. And we don't I'm not saying that no one's going to drive at all. It's just that we're hoping to really maximize the the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I like to I appreciate that. So I'd like to know how many parking spaces that Harbor Bay. And I know we've got an excess of cars that use that one and I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Appreciate their main street ferry terminals will be open to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct, but I am concerned about building a ferry that serves just this area. Why? Because when I look at the housing, I think we are not building what I want to call workforce housing. I think you've got below market rate and I think you have a majority of higher end and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and this is at least $10 million. I, I think it's going to cost. I don't know what the deal is, where the rest of the money is going to come from. I don't think 10 million is going to cover it at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. But. Okay, the sports complex, what is the total cost for the sports complex? We're getting 5 million from this development. What's the rest of it?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have in the master infrastructure plan is $20 million.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And where is that? Where's the other 15 million going to come from?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'From other phases of development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when will that be? What's the time like before we actually have families that get to use the sports complex.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, you mean when will we get the rest of the money first? Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When is it going to be built? Because this is for our community. You're setting aside 5 million for something that I think truly will benefit our community at large. Mm hmm. And where's how. What's your timeline? I'm going to want to this one.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On the red. It's going to depend on the timeline for the rest of the development that's really subject to the city council desire to dispose and develop plan. So. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if we don't have any estimate for that, then I sounds like we shouldn't be holding our breath for when we're going to actually get a sports complex. They may be putting up the $5 million, but we're not going to see anything.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if I may, similar to other park projects, it's also feasible to do things in stages, and we've talked about that with the sports complex. So for example, that's something I'm doing with Estuary Park will be doing phase one and phase two.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sweeney Park will be probably 4 to 5 phases.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's not that we necessarily need to raise the entire.'",
        "'speaker_1': '20 million before we even begin building and opening to the public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will be looking for more information in regards to how we're going to have something that the public can use. I think that's very important. And and I see the sports complex, at least at this point. Do we know how many parking spaces and will be at the sports complex and what that really we have any'",
        "'speaker_0': 'idea about when we say sports complex, what that is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've not done any detailed design on the sports complex.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have it'll depend on how many fields, what type of fields, what types of amenities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there's it's it's really.'",
        "'speaker_1': '44 acres of blank space for us to work within at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I think that our community does feel like we have a shortage of sports fields and that that is a big concern for our community. I don't know if our community at large thinks that we need actually, I have been talking to people about the theory and I thought a good comment that came up was we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have a ferry at Harbor Bay and we already have one at the point, but we have nothing in the middle and that's actually a big part of where our residents live. So if we were pulling back and we were thinking where to serve Alameda and would we want a if we wanted another ferry, where would we want'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it to be? I'm not sure we would want it a mile, a mile and a half from an existing ferry. And I'm hoping that we can come up with. So so when I look at this, I'm thinking that this goes to our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A large and the sports complex may very well be a better use of the money so that we actually get something. And I and I know there's. Apparently people that live in these homes. And, you know, we're trying to encourage people to ride their bikes all over, but to ask them to ride their bike a mile or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a mile and a half, maybe out of the equation, that they need a ferry that they can just quickly ride their bikes to or watch. And I'm not sure that that's correct. Actually, I would submit that's not correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm not sure that that's really the need. Overall, workforce housing, there is a need for what I'm going to call housing for middle income people, whatever that is. I'm not sure that that is being addressed here, and that is a big issue in regards to whatever type of jobs are being put here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is this the housing that will support those people, whatever if we're doing retail? And I would I would submit that they're not going to be able to afford most of this housing. So whatever I think, if possible, the jobs that are brought in should match a line with the housing because that will in fact reduce your traffic'",
        "'speaker_0': '. If the we don't have to have people driving on and off of the island driving, they can work. I think that's ideal. We're looking for people that can work and live there. Okay. The percentage and the water issue, that's a big issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I appreciate the work that's been done on that because we all know we're in a drought and Allen meetings are being impacted by that. So that's that. I appreciate that work. The percentage of these homes that are being leased as opposed to by now, the comments in this report go to there hasn't been that much new'",
        "'speaker_0': 'rental housing built. But I've noticed what I think happens is that we have single family homes that are sold and then some people turn around and lease them. So they did not initially get put out to be leased.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's what happens. And you have many if you look at Bayport, for instance, there are people there that are that are renting. It didn't start as a rental. But what is nice about that for a city is that when a Prop 13 benefits or for IT owners of property long term because they're they don't have a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'change they're able to have a corporation hold the rental property and they may change on people that are working there or whatnot. But over time they're still holding that corporation, still holding the property, which means the value is not being reassessed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That occurs when the property is sold and when an individual eyes a house, then they rent it out. Then then the property is going to have more turnover and that benefits our community. Time and the timing of the property long term in a long in a lease situation like that when we're talking about such a high percentage'",
        "'speaker_0': '. That concerns me. And I and I disagree with the suggestion that you don't have new rentals just because you're not doing a rental apartment building. We have many people that rent homes and or we don't really have that many condos, but they rent homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in fact, I think we have overall higher percentage of rentals in our community compared to other communities in the Bay Area. And yet this is correct, and that we don't have that many apartment buildings, but we have lots of rentals regardless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The roads, what they're going to actually look like. I recently had the opportunity. Thank you to the bicycling enthusiasts to meet one of the mayors from Copenhagen who talked about how they do designing of roads and and they don't they don't actually don't do cycle tracks they try to do the same direction as the cars, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'they do but they design it intentionally so that you have roads that accommodate your drivers as well as a lot of bicyclists and walk and people that are walking different modes of transportation. And I think that if someone can look at what they're doing, actually that's what this meeting was about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The many of a few of us had the opportunity, including staff. I think we have to be more focused on trying to make it work when we have our bicyclists and our walkers and our cars, cars sharing the same roads, senior housing that continues to come up, how will this housing accommodate seniors?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that also goes to universal housing. One thing I have noticed with tri level homes over by target is that the washer and dryer can be on the top floor, which and there'll be a room on the whatever floor you enter on if it's the first floor, the second floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think it's important to have the washer and dryer on whatever the main floor is with that bedroom so that your person that is limit has limited mobility can actually exist on one floor of a tri level home, if that's what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Trial of a home's. Chuck routes I'd like to see and that may be in here exactly how our truck routes are going to be set up because we have that read a maintenance facility. Where the roads are going to be cutting across through this development if they're coming across this development at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To get the field to the wheel building and hopefully they don't have to go through this housing development to get their. Okay. And when I looked at the overall chart, I think it was exhibit 11, which I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The single family homes, 125 of them, 850,000 was the number here. And this is beyond your development. But in regards to staff and it does connect to this development because 125 of the homes, single family, 850,000 townhomes, 300 800, 795,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's 425. But I'm going to call high end homes out of. 497 homes to buy their condos. 72 condos, 72 condos, 300 townhomes, 100,000, 72 condos or 540. Okay. That could be in the middle that I'm going to call middle, but that's only 72.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You've got 425 that are 800,000 or higher. That's approximately 85% of what to buy is what I'm going to call high end or luxury overall. I don't think that's going to reflect our jobs. I don't think that reflects our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I see that as a problem. The apartments. You've got 400, 526 apartments. That are not the low and very low, the low and very low apartments. I can understand and appreciate the comments that we need those to be apartments to provide the services and make it work, and then that benefits the people that are living there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure that this division of. 425 high end.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Homes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '72 condos, and then 526 apartments that are relatively expensive because we're not going to be able to we will not have rent control there ever. That will always be market rate per state. We would have to change something at the state level, which means that's a high percentage that we can't we can't control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, if we did moderate, if we did more condos change this up somehow, then I think you have a better chance of taking care of people. But then middle income, how many cars will actually be generated from this project?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's going to be a significant number. They will be driving through that tube. They will not all take the ferry. You take the ferry to get to San Francisco. You don't take the ferry to go to Oakland. Yes, some people will be riding their bike to Oakland, not currently through the tube there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not not very many cars will be generated. Okay. To me, the only reason it makes sense to have to offset this traffic that I see is a big issue is if in fact we're addressing some of the issues that Alameda INS have and I'll and what I hear is Alameda instead of being pushed out of this town'",
        "'speaker_0': 'because they cannot afford to stay here which means this housing somehow has and seniors. Somehow I think that. Okay there's your balance. If the housing that we're producing will address the needs of our maidens or mere the jobs somehow so that we're not just ending up with housing for people that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well are your high, high income families or individuals because that does not reflect Alameda. And when I hear about the ferry, I'm thinking that's your ferry that aligns with your high end housing. And then what about the people in the middle?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How does this project help them? Those are my concerns. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think if I could just comment quickly in terms of the current housing scenario, I think the 5000 feet picture of as to why Joe Ernst and Company or even if you look at Bayport, why Bayport turned out the way it is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, you need to take a look at, for example. Ron Cowans Project Alpha at Harbor Bay Isle or when Dawn Parker started. Marina Village. You know, back in the seventies, these guys were rebuilding. I mean, Dawn Parker, when he put together Marina Villas, they were building basically on, you know, areas where there was really nothing'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Marina Village was kind of a dump. What's it called? Harbor Bay was, you know, just kind of open land. It's like, you know, Bay, before we was a farm. I think the challenge for any developer, whether it's Joe Ernst or Catalist or whomever, when it comes Alameda point, is that this is important for the public to understand'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is that we're basically doing brownfield development. And what that means is that, you know, there's a certain amount of investment that's created that's required just to get to the gate, just to get the property to the to be developable state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So right off the bat, that almost doubles the cost of of of whatever project that you're involved in because it's not only laying down the infrastructure that's required to support development, but it's actually tearing out the awful stuff that's already there on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And by virtue of that, you know, that doubles the cost. You're going in, you're tearing it out, and then you're going to put back, you know, things that that are needed. So in order to deal with kind of this brownfield development that, say, Ron Cowen didn't have to deal with over at Harvard or or Don Parker didn't'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have to deal with over at Marina Village. Don Parker, by the way, was our first R.A., our executive director. In order to deal with these on the revenue side, on the revenue generating side, you do have to have a certain program that does that does entail, you know, $800,000 homes, townhomes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, those are expensive, no doubt. And I couldn't afford it. I mean, I'm glad I can afford what I have. But, you know, that's the challenge of doing Alameda point, of dealing with very real infrastructure related problems.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And on top of that, dealing with the social issues that we as a city have decided to embrace. One of those social issues being the 25% set aside for affordable housing, for very low income people and low income people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that by virtue of that, as the representative from Eaton Housing said, you know, the city of Alameda is making these decisions that have implications with regard to how you develop the rest of Alameda point to deal with these social cost issues, to deal with infrastructure cost issues, to deal with the transportation issues.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, I understand, you know, a lot of people have concerns about housing and they want to see workforce, moderate income housing. I understand that. And I think we have in Joe Ernst and SRM and all the different partners.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry, I don't mean to just always say Mr. Ernst, but we do have people who are, you know, struggling mightily to to meet the objectives, the many varied objectives that we, as the residents have indicated that we want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But, you know, there's there's so much give that the project can take, can give. And and I think, you know, the effort that MBS art has done in putting together the staff and the and the Fiscal Impact Analysis Report indicates that, you know, this is a very tight project and we're at a late portion of this development'",
        "'speaker_5': 'process where it's very, very difficult to load on new objectives. You know, in terms of dealing with the rental housing crisis of right now, you know, I'm not going to oversell the argument. I'm not going to say just because you build more rental housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Therefore, you know, as the typical market based approach says, you know, that the supply of rental housing and everything is going to be great, that, you know, equilibrium, market equilibrium is going to reach a certain point and suddenly housing be affordable once again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe it won't work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Out like that. I mean, other people have different theories. The guy who does Case-Shiller, you know, he says, you know, sometimes the market doesn't work that way. So. I think we're doing a yeoman's effort here, not just SRM, but also all the people who brought us to this this point in dealing with the infrastructure cost related issues'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and dealing with the transportation issues. And by virtue of that, there are real life implications in terms of the program that that one we're putting together, that that type of housing. And at some point in time, we're going have to make a decision and finally move forward, because it's been 21 years now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And if I could just add, I appreciated Councilmember de Suggs remarks, and I think there's a temptation when we're creating this new project just for creating something out of nothing or a lot of, you know, really bad things that have been cleaned up and remediated and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there is a tendency to want to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop with this this project. And we're not going to be able to do that for a number of reasons. Can we get closer to solving some of the problems and the issues before us and in contributing to this community?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. And that's where the recreational opportunities come in. And the transit dollars and I, I and I appreciated Mr. Aldrich's comments about we can phase parks. That's what she does for a living. She creates parks and she's seen that it doesn't all happen at once, but you can still create some in a recreational area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But if we don't do this at all, all of that is off the table. So, you know, we have to to weigh carefully what it is we we preserve and what it is we throw away if we decided not to go down this path.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think we also shouldn't lose sight as a council of the kinds of solutions we can work closer toward right now. And for instance, we've talked a lot about affordable rents and, you know, people being priced out of this town because they can't afford their rents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope that soon the rental ordinance that we contemplated and was sent back for some tweaking, I hope that'll come back to us soon and I hope it will be passed unanimously by this council because I really feel bad for the folks who were hoping that we would have passed it back when it came to us before'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But that's something we can make a dent in now, is to at least make sure that people are not being priced out of their home there, their rental units, without at least some fair hearing to to see whether or not that's a just increase and have some attempt at having their case heard.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there's some things we can actually do now that are right in front of us. There's some great things out there potential in the future. But we I agree. When Mr. De Sykes said we just have to resist the temptation to load on more and more expectations of this because I think we've loaded quite a bit on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'already. But anyway, I I'm really appreciative of every time this comes before us for an update, we've got more detail and it'll help us make that much more an informed decision next month. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One more comment. The negotiations are not over. I mean. The D-Day is in front of us. So I'm hoping that our input is being. I'm sure it is. It's being heard. And I think the mayor raised some points of basically stretching the envelope of what the mix would be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we need to hear what comes back from that. I, I think I added some on trying to load risk of if in housing can't get their financing, we're still going to deliver the 128 units and we're not going to deliver it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I must I want to see what we can negotiate that the developer delivers it and that in that failsafe scenario.
