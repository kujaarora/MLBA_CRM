        "'speaker_1': 'Do. Do you have any comments on that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He. Good evening. I'm Julian Boyer. I am substituting for Elena Adair, your finance director, for the three weeks that she's on vacation. This item comes before you each year to adopt new fees or to improve the fees that have been on the list.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And each year, they are increased by either the CPI or the building building index. So I've checked the fees. They comply with that. There are a few new fees, not very many, but there are the fees that are new are in the Community Development Planning section and they are actually for a smaller entity.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct. I'm sorry. Yes. It's one of those terms that you just get so used to saying that you forget. And then there was one fee that was removed from the list that's on page four and is in the police department and Alcoholic Beverage Control License approval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, and it was originally a $50 fee, and it applied only in our case to nonprofit organizations that got a one day license. And the chief of police recommended that we move that fee to zero, since it's a signature only.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what we were charging was removing fundraising efforts from the nonprofit. So that fee has been proposed to be reduced from 50 to 0. Those are the only real major changes. There are some minor wording changes, but not in the fees themselves.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The language changes were to be clarify and be more descriptive. And that makes it easier for staff to apply and for the public to understand what the fee is. Staff members who participated in creating this fee resolution are in the audience and would be available to answer questions.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And we agreed that it wouldn't really necessarily. Do much. But it was a matter perhaps of a wishful thinking or perhaps, as I recall from one of the senators, famous senators, to borrow this term. Well, we wouldn't fool the.'",

It's super far from the existing place and the water's a little bit more choppy in that area, even though some of the community members have seen SEALs in that area.'",

One of the things I noted that I think is a positive in this one is that in this year there is no allocation from fund reserves to cover expenses above the current year budget.'",

As you know, assessments for the Park Street Zone of the city's landscaping lighting district have been flat since the mid 1990s. These assessments fund sidewalk cleaning, tree trimming and maintenance of the public litter cans.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a consequence of the flat assessments, services have declined and maintenance has declined in the district. Beginning in 2013, public works coordinated with Pittsburgh, the Park Street Business Association, to develop a proposal to double assessments over three years and thus improve services.'",

However, if this balloting effort is successful and we have more assessment money for more maintenance, we can increase perhaps increase the frequency of the litter can maintenance to help address the issue.'",

In other words, our fraternity will derive absolutely no benefit from the proposed assessment and the services it will allegedly support.

        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, honorable mayor and Council. This will probably be short and sweet for you tonight. I want to compliment the city and the Park Street Business Association. And I'll start with just a little bit of my history. I've been involved in various business consulting or whatever in Alameda for over 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it was my first time of actually visiting the island, and I loved it. And I would say memories there. That's the white hair. But probably about 10 to 12 years ago I purchased the building on Park Street, which I'm thrilled with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it was I tag it before Peet's and Starbucks as opposed to after. So I just felt great about this street. I love coming here. The tenants I have are great. The people surrounding it, the community. I've worked with the city a lot on various permits and getting the tenants in order.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I thank you. But from a standpoint of the Park Street Business Association generally, is it? Building owner. Do I like paying taxes? No. But do I recognize the value that the organization brings to us from Park Street?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The what I've seen, the differences with the landscaping, the changes, all of those things, it makes a difference. We do need more trash receptacles. Please, please. We've had a couple of hours removed and never to be found again.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So whatever we can do for trash would be really great. And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Rob Rando.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, hi, Rob Bravo, executive director of the downtown Alameda Business Association. Yeah, we're. We had a soft opening on the name. Thank you. I just wanted to clear up one piece of what I believe is misinformation from the first speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Any tenant, any business tenant in that building is a member of the Park Street Business Association. He may not be aware of that, but they are. Trust me, I know these things. However, the reason I turn into speaker slip is to try to maybe clarify for Mr. O.D. and the rest of the council pertaining to the trash'",
        "'speaker_4': 'cans. Weekends the the maintenance company. They try to keep them as un overflowing as possible. But we are looking into with public works to replacing the plastic trash cans that took the place of the really crummy old green ones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in fact, today was a perfect example of one of the reasons we're trying to replace them is the the fire den there at San Antonio and Park Street. Someone had moved the the can in and it had positioned it in such a way that Akai could not get to it with the claw because it was behind'",
        "'speaker_4': 'one of the bike racks. Now, as I've stated on numerous occasions, I made one phone call to my contact at HCI and by the time I went by there at 2:00 in the afternoon, the can had been moved and it had been empty.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, we're doing the best we can and we are looking at getting much better, permanently installed trash cans that are actually not that bad looking. So I just wanted to get up and clarify that for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated. Okay. No problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any comments or questions. They see no one else who wishes to be heard. Do any members of the City Council have any further questions for the city staff or consultants as a result of public testimony? All right. I do have a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I looked up the Masonic Hall and it looks like that they have the nonprofit rate. And I'm trying to figure out. It looks like it goes, was it 103 or was it zero? You know, from looking at this and then it looks like it goes 195 to 45 and then to 99.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But can someone tell me what they currently pay or what they have in pain?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We can tell you what they're currently paying. I'm just going to check with and guess who is our financial consultant for special districts to get.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the middle of page 31 or. If you want to try to find it. It has a dash. If I'm reading this correctly, under fiscal year 1415. Does the dash mean zero?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry about that. The Masonic is not part of the current boundary of the districts. As part of this balloting process, we are modifying and updating the boundary to reflect the services that happen as part of the Park Street landscape and lighting zone.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So they will be receiving an assessment if the balloting effort is successful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So you say we. So who is determining that they were not in the Park Street Business Association district and now they will be. They were not in a part that was assessed before, but they will now be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There were not in the district as it was in the zone as it was formed in 1984. But it was through the special benefit general benefit analysis that was done as part of helping. Or preparing for this increased assessment to determine that they are receiving benefit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Therefore, those who are receiving a benefit must be assessed for the benefit they're receiving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And is that the I'm sorry. Let me finish my questions and then you can speak afterwards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Right. So is it the city that is now determining that they are in this group?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. It was an engineer's report that the that was commissioned by staff. It's an engineer's report that actually did the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But who's bringing this? Is it Pittsburgh or is it the city that is making this change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is asking for this increased assessment to go forward when their board has voted to proceed with that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I appreciate it, but I'm trying to figure out if you have a business that apparently has not been part of Pittsburgh for how many years? Since at least 1984.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Actually, I think from the clarification from Mr. Rado, potentially the Elks themselves were not part of.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Masonic Lodge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry, but the businesses within and I don't know if he's here clarify that, but that the businesses within the Masonic actually were, are part of Pittsburgh. But the building itself is now within the district. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that change. Okay, that's what I'm speaking to. Why are they now within it? Whereas before they hadn't been.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, by law, when you're doing these assessments, an engineer's report is required by law. And the engineer's report looks at and see who has a benefit. And if you have a benefit, whether you like it or not, you have to pay into the assessment district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So they are receiving a benefit, therefore they have to pay into it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so when was the last time there was an engineer's report on this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As part of the regular levy. The first item that we had the public hearing for, we do a regular engineer's report every year for the landscape and lighting districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So apparently in the past, they did not find that this that they had any benefit. But today they are. Let me finish, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Question actually piggybacks on yours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think if I'm reading the staff report correctly, this accord on page two, it talks about the the council we as well. In February 2014, the city council awarded a contract to conduct the analysis, voting and reporting required to increase the assessments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they talk about in the report how the analysis has complicated because any increase any assessment increase triggers prop 218, which is of course, state law, which was passed after the district's founding, which is part of the complication.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But Prop 218 special benefit analysis requires a parcel by parcel review of land use and benefit, rather than the previous analysis, which was based on acreage and frontage. So the state law mandates it's not the city, but it's the state mandates that any property that receives a special benefit must also be assessed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that somewhere in this report it talks about how there I mean, there is there are going to be some hard feelings, no doubt, because there are some people who have been enjoying benefits without paying into the assessment, and there's others who have been paying into the assessment which actually might have their assessments lower just'",
        "'speaker_5': 'because of the analysis, the benefit analysis that is being done. So I think it's not just peers, but if this is actually compliant with state law, if I'm understanding correctly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. But this has passed. So when did Prop 218 passed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_1': '96? That that is my issue. Okay. So that's my concern is there have been reports, engineer reports since passage of Prop 218, and yet this apparently was not addressed earlier. We apparently do this every year. This was changed in 96.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Remember already. And so why today as opposed to the last year, every year since 1996?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure, I will defer to NBC if I'm speaking incorrectly here, but it is the increase of assessments that triggers this special, this revisit to the special versus general benefit analysis. And because between the time of the formation of the district and this time, which has been has said they would like to increase assessments and go through this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'process, we do have property 18 law changes. We have changes to parcels within the district to have parcels such as the Masonic that have been reclassified from for profit to nonprofit that do affect the outcome of that analysis as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you mentioned that the rates had remained flat since the mid 1990s, right? Correct. And also, just for clarification, even if some entity hasn't paid the assessment in the past, we're not looking to go back and collect it retroactively.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Correct. That is that is an excellent question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From this day forward, if assuming it passes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mayor, and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you confirm that the request or or an increase in assessment is what triggers a special needs engineering report? Correct. Correct. And there have been no request for increased assessment for almost two decades.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that trigger that's the reason why in the past this hasn't been addressed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any other questions or comments? All right. Okay. Fallon, I think this is where I am now. I would like to remind everyone that all. Thank you. I would like to remind everyone that all assessment ballots and replacement assessment ballots must be received by the city clerk before this public hearing is closed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Assessment ballots or replacement assessment ballots received after the close of this public hearing will not be tabulated. Are there any owners who have not submitted their assessment ballots and need additional time to submit their assessment ballots? Or are there any owners who have submitted their assessment ballots but now wish to submit a replacement assessment ballot?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If so, the City Council will take a five minute recess before closing the public hearing to allow for the submission of such ballots. Seen? We have. Would you like to approach the podium or speak with the clerk?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You could use the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm sorry. Microphone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Please approach. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I filled out my ballot but went on vacation and I don't know that it was mailed. My daughter thinks that she might have tossed it, so it's only one vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So at this point, then I will call for a recess and we will resolve that and then we'll resume. Okay. Thank you. Great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. All right.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We will now take a short recess. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. So powerful is the are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will now be resuming. Upon completion of the tabulation of the assessment ballots, the city clerk will notify the City Council that the tabulation has been completed.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Hmm. But.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The percentage was 26.06 in favor and 73.94.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So when the. So that means that the measure fails. So then is there a specific language that I read at that point?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, Madam Chair, there is a you cannot adopt the motion, obviously, to approve the district. And in fact, with the failure resulting in a majority protest, which is then the failure of this assessment to go forward, it cannot come back again for a year as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But so we have a resolution that declares the results are at the bottom.'",

District number 84-2 zone for Park Street determine the existence of a majority protest and abandoning the proceedings to increase such assessments there in.'",

Nonetheless, I want to thank the Park Street Business Association Board for their hard work in educating their members about this proposal. Public Works remains committed to working with Pittsburgh to figure out how to raise the necessary funds to enhance the area's maintenance.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Right. So we do need to figure out a way to do that without using the assessment district funds. We can no, we can't use the funds to provide that service. We need to staff in public works, needs to work with peers to figure out a way to absorb that outside of the assessment district.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'But it means that the Council I certainly didn't have a chance to go over them and I can tell that my colleague De SA spent a lot of time and effort on them. I feel that to make an informed decision and in fairness to the public who should have the opportunity to look this over to.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we believe we have enough information and we are willing to adopt it right here and now. And that kind of thing typically happens just with the letter of support of some kind of a thing or something like this, which is frankly a media issue that needs some consideration and will require staff work.'",

I don't think we would be able to do this anyway. And because it actually has to be approved by the voters, it's not something that we would be able to implement.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And I see so many possibilities. I mean, if Oakland can do it, we can do it. We've got a huge list of tourism assets. And, you know, the taxes that you make, the sales tax revenue that you bring in as a result of deciding that you want to be a destination city is incredible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is low hanging fruit and that's what we need to go after, low hanging fruit. And if we can create an exciting visit Alameda campaign, I can assure you that we would be well on our way to increase in sales tax revenues and increasing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you know, all that money can go towards our budget deficit. I mean, there's so many, so many wonderful benefits from becoming a tourism, a tourist destination. So I, I hope that we move forward and look at that look at this as a great possibility for Alameda.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Effective July 1st. It's Airbnb is growing. They're getting larger and larger. And. I believe that Alameda has a great opportunity. I think this is one of the first things that we would look at to increase tourism is to think of ourselves as partnering with Airbnb.'",
