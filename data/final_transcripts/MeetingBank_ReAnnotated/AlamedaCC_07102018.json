        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Vice Mayor, did you have specific questions or how would you like to proceed at this time?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I asked my questions prior to the meeting and I'm satisfied with the answers, but I had gotten some questions from a couple of members of the public, and so I wanted to just pull the item to go over and convey the answers that I received shortly before the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So first of all, one of the questions that I've been asked is why were not working with Alameda Hospital to provide these occupational medical services? My understanding from staff is that these services are not offered by Alameda Hospital, so that's why we've contracted with Kaiser.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And from what I heard from our staff, they've they've liked working with Kaiser. It's been a good relationship, both from the management perspective and from the employee perspective. And then the second thing I was asked was, why was there an increase?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my my understanding is that there has been increases relative to the number of employees we are going to be sending over for testing. It's not an increase in the actual cost. And I see that Nancy's and Nancy Brownstein's at the podium, and Nancy provided me the answers to those questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you, Nancy. And I think the other thing that I had asked was I noticed in the staff report, we have certain departments that are directly billed for their employees going for this testing, but some of the other departments actually fall under budget.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, Nancy, my question for you is, and you mentioned this in your email to me, that there's a history to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council Members. Nancy Bronstein.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Human resources director. Council vice mayor. Bella, I didn't I'm sorry, I didn't hear your question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You mentioned that there is a history or a reasoning behind the fire department and AMP being directly billed for those services versus H.R. covering the cost for the other departments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's correct. And it precedes my being here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my understanding is the fire department actually, because they send employees both for pre-employment and annual medical test.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That they really like to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Manage that budget themselves. They manage that. They do a great job managing the process, making sure that everybody's getting the appropriate test.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But then when the bills come in, they review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Those bills, they make sure they're correct, they're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Being billed correctly, and then.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They are the ones then making the payments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And for AMP, it's an enterprise fund, so it's a separate fund and it's been set up that way.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Expense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So then any other questions or comments? We do not have any speakers on the site. And so I think we can go ahead with a motion at this time.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Potter. As we all know, we don't have sufficient affordable housing below market housing for the public. And this item goes to changing the preference points, how they're allocated to people that are trying to obtain the units. And so I wanted to have staff present on that what this proposal is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you very much. I'm Debbie Porter. I'm the city's community development director. And the item before you this evening is a recommendation to amend the preference points for the city's inclusionary housing program. The inclusionary housing program is the requirement that market rate developers provide 15% of their units affordable to very low, low and moderate income households'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And we contract with our housing authority to administer our inclusionary housing program. We use a lottery system when we award those inclusionary units. And our lottery system also entails a an opportunity for preference points to be granted. And those preference points.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're proposing to amend the preference points and streamline them. Currently, we provide a preference point for first time homebuyers. We would remove or eliminate that as a preference point and make it a program requirement, a threshold requirement so that you would if you're going to participate, you have to be a first time homebuyer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we currently have a preference point for large families, and we are proposing to eliminate that preference point two, and we're proposing to eliminate that. We as part of our fair housing requirements, we conduct an analysis of impediments to fair housing and large families that are not discriminated against disproportionately within the city in terms of fair housing'",
        "'speaker_5': '. So we think it's more straightforward to just require a minimum requirement that you must have the family size must be equal to the number of bedrooms. So if you have a two person household, you could apply for a one or two bedroom household.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And our third preference point that we currently provide is a preference point. If you live or work in Alameda and we are proposing to maintain that preference point and then expand the preference point or add an additional preference point for a USDA employees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda Unified School District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Alameda Unified School District Employees for moderate income units only a maximum of one unit per project, or no more than 30% of the moderate income units that might be available in any given project. And the reason that we are recommending this preference point to the Council and this revision to our inclusionary housing program is because the city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'has an opportunity to access $30 million in affordable housing funds from our former redevelopment agency. And we have been directed by the State Department of Finance to run that funding through the school district because those funds are available as part of the 1991 pass through agreement between the school district and the former redevelopment agency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the district and the Housing Authority have negotiated a memorandum of understanding about how that process would work for the housing authority to access that money to build low and very low income housing. And part of what was agreed to was that the housing authority would request city staff to bring a preference point for moderate income ownership'",
        "'speaker_5': 'units before the Council as consideration for the school district. Processing and sending these funds through to the Housing Authority and staff is recommending, therefore, that the Council approve this revision. In the preference points. We are recommending other changes to our inclusionary underwriting guidelines and to the appeal process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have had our inclusionary ordinance in place for over 15 years and this is the first time council staff has brought clean up recommendations and kind of best practices and bringing our program guidelines current. So that is staff's recommendation this evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And how long would this additional preference point to a USG employees be for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through 2050 that the project area runs till 2046? We have the opportunity to receive these funds through 2046 and if monies coming in and projects are being built three years out was that was the logic for coming up with 2050.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And is it based on when the money actually comes in or does this start immediately? How does how do we make sure that we're getting money that is somehow is it somehow tied to actual receipt of money so that we know that new units are being built that would not be built, but for receipt of this'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Correct. So every year we prepare an annual recognized obligation payment schedule, a ROPS, and every year we, we put down the funding that will come to us for projects that have affordable housing units that can be reimbursed. And we are sitting right now on invoices from seven from.'",
        "'speaker_5': '17, 17, 18, and then four, 18, 19. So for the past three fiscal years, we have received these funds and we have projects for which we want to reimburse the housing authority for money that they have advanced in anticipation of this MRU getting finalized, which was finalized by a UCD board and the Housing Authority Board of Commissioners'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in May of this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So is there going to be some way to have oversight to ensure that these monies did in fact come in from a USD two, which then their employees received a benefit?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How is that going to happen?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, so through the memorandum of understanding that's been executed between the USDA and the housing authority, all of the funding is done on a reimbursement basis. And all of the marketing and advertising and outreach for the unit availability will be coordinated between the housing authority and the school district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can someone go to the housing authority, for instance, annually and see, you know, what? And that in fact, you know, if in fact, employees were able to receive these preference points and obtained access to units and that in fact moneys were received from AUC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, there would be some kind of formal report that that is available to ensure that, you know, because honestly, my concern is that we have many people in the city that will not that do not work for Alameda Unified, that do, in fact, desire affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I wanted to make sure that somehow there's a real relationship that there is a are additional homes being built to offset that preference to a USDA employees? So there will be some kind of report that will be accessible to the public annually.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. We'll somehow demonstrate that. That. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then I want to. Catherine, I'm going to go ahead and call a cab. Thank you, Alan. At this time, the public speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I in council. Thank you so much for your time. I stand in opposition to a portion of the measure and five G and that is the portion that allocates 30% of affordable housing to the moderate income homeownership opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I say that because I think 30% is a very big portion of what is in very limited supply. And personally, I'm a single parent. I 100% physical legal custody. I have no financial support. I truly don't feel that I deserve less of a chance to get into affordable housing than a teacher.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The way that this preference points system is that if you're an 82 employee and that does not mean a teacher, that means any employee part time, full time at all that you get an additional preference points. You would have four preference points instead of three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Everybody else in the general public can maximum only get three preference points. So this gives the EEOC employee an advantage over everybody else. I feel it's an unfair advantage, discriminates based upon profession and occupation. I think, to be quite honest, federal fair housing regulations don't limit discrimination based upon occupation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think we could kind of all agree that that might not really be quite fair in terms of the affordable housing, the $30 million of funding. I'd like to know what will happen to that $30 million of funding if we don't agree to this MRU.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What is happening to that funding right now? Well, it does appear. Will it be given to housing authority anyway? Why wasn't it directed to the Housing Authority as a partner to begin with? If it was allocated for a USD, why isn't USD building their own housing with that money?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I started a thread about this on a public Facebook group and the thread generated over 150 comments. Susan Davis, the acting community manager for USD, commented. Mike McMahon, who's a former school board member, commented The post is deleted after about 48 hours.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There were so many people commenting and this post was deleted. People didn't know about this measure being brought before the city and there were a lot of different opinions, but nobody on that board was in the position I am.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where they're seeking affordable housing. And I think that that voice needs to be heard. I definitely wasn't reaching it through that community bulletin board. And I do think that this issue is a broad issue that's going to impact residents and workers of the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's something that needs to be thought about, you know, carefully and thoughtfully so that, you know, people get a fair chance.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So the MCU has been seen in what the MCU says is that if the city council does not approve that the preference point for one one inclusionary moderate income unit minimum or a maximum of 30 moderate income units in any given project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'By September of this year that the MCU, the district, will honor the costs incurred in the 1617 fiscal year for affordable housing and in 1718. But that's it. And then we the money is lost. We the money goes to the money essentially goes into a waterfall and goes to all the taxing entities and does not stay in'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Remember Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I appreciate the the explanation. Miss Potter and I, I do understand the speaker's concern. I mean, I'm concerned we just aren't producing enough housing, affordable housing. We might have an opportunity to do something about that just a little later in this agenda.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at the same time, I don't know how we would benefit from turning back money that will go to help building affordable housing. Yes, a percentage of that housing at the moderate income level will be allocated to any USDA employee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But without it, that additional housing wouldn't get built. And just by comparison, $30 million. I wish we went further. But for instance and correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Potter, the new senior affordable housing that's going up at the corner of Sherman and Buena Vista next to Del Monte, that was about a $30 million project for 30'",
        "'speaker_6': 'units.'",
        "'speaker_5': '$88 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': '80 million for 30.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over 33 units.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For 32 units. So that was in the when when that project went into contract. Construction costs have gone up a bit. But Will the good news is we will get housing out of this affordable housing and you know, some will go to USD employees, but without that money we wouldn't have that source of funds to help build'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it. But I just I don't want to pit one group against the other. I want to recognize we have a housing supply shortage and we need to do something about that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm sorry the public comment part was completed, but I want to follow up on so any other council comments at this time or questions otherwise? I'm going to go ahead and ask. Okay. So can you explain what public outreach occurred on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did the city have any meetings with community members for their feedback?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did not. The community outreach consisted this agenda. This item was actually agenda is for June 5th. And when that agenda was posted in that staff report was posted, then Ms.. Allen was able to see the item and then engage in the the Facebook, the social media conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then it was followed up with a continuation to tonight's meeting, and it was part of tonight's posted agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But the city did not itself hold any outreach on this item. Okay. In regards to housing, when it get built, what housing would not get built. But for this 30 million. Because I actually don't know that that's a true statement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have housing that gets approved. We have, for instance, a project tonight and the developer is going to provide the funding we have site is will site. Will this money go to, for instance, site A that is not funded currently 43 million short well by this money go to get that housing funded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This these funds are restricted to very low and low income units only so they would. So it is possible that for the very low and low income portion of the units that yes the money there could be funding from this source for the city, even housing projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But that goes to my concern of how do we, in fact, know that this money is going to building the units, that then we're giving the preference to points to a USD four as opposed to just any units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the concern. Right. That we had to speaker on this, if there is no money from this, a USD that goes to the affordable housing, then will a US employees do not get preference points for so than for all members of our community equally.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or do they do they only get preference points when it is in fact housing built with the USD money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are preference points for a USDA employees for the very low and low income units that are built with these moneys. But these funds cannot be used for moderate income units. So there is an A. So under the inclusionary program, we are creating a preference point for a max of 30% of moderate income units.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That are those moderate income units where in fact there was a low and very low built or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dependent independent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So then do you keep track and you say, okay, over here there's the low and very low five units. So then we're going to do five units moderate. Is there any relationship between what's being built with a USD money and the number of moderate units being where we're awarding additional preference points?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now those are two independent programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So how do you figure out how many moderate units that we give a USD employees a preference point for then?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, we have proposed we have proposed that we have proposed a minimum of one moderate income unit per project up to a maximum of 30.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What is that based on?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was based on the negotiations between the school board and the housing authority. And the request then was made to city staff to bring that proposal to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But is it based on dollar amounts? You have $30 million supposedly from a USDA that's going to may be used to build housing. It may or may not, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, it absolutely has to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Paid for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Low and very low income housing. It is on a reimbursement basis only. It's based on invoicing and it will only go to use used for very low and low.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Income housing than the moderate units. Is that the moderate units immediately they become available. The USD employees get a preference point for even if we haven't built any new units that are affordable or low, very, very low or low affordable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have already we have already generated over about $3 million worth of expenses on very low and low income housing over the past two and a half fiscal years, which well are already eligible to be refunded with this money before there is a single moderate income unit that is made available on a preference point basis only.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So costs have already been incurred and will be reimbursed before we ever award one inclusionary moderate income unit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But is there then do you are you going to be keeping track of the number of units that are built very low and low that then offset the moderate or the relationship, which is they get 30% regardless of the number of units of the very low and low.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct. During the time period of the B WEP and the pass through agreements life, you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Know, there's not a relationship really is 30% period, regardless of how many very low and low are funded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So let me speak to my attorney then. There was also a concern of then some sort of discrimination. Can we in fact, award reference points to one group of employees when there's no relationship between the number of units being built with that money and what they're being awarded, they're getting 30%, regardless of how many units are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'being built with these moneys. And that would seem to me like there's some sort of legal challenge there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the way this evolved was because the path the 1991 pass through agreement had all of the moderates, not moderate, had all of the housing money, which was in redevelopment terms there, 20% of the generated tax increment. 20% of that money had to go to build affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': '80% could go for other purposes. The 1991 pass through agreement had the 20% housing money flow through to the school district. And since it was in 1991 and none of us were here. My understanding, reading the agreement is that the intention was that the school district was going to attempt to build housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That didn't happen over the course of time. So we now are trying to protect that money flowing through since redevelopment has been dissolved, that that money, which otherwise, as Ms.. Potter described, would go through the waterfall and and would go through all the various taxing entities, not be designated for housing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That that money be protected and continue to flow to the city of Alameda to build affordable housing in Alameda since the school district. So the school district worked with the housing authority, which is the entity that continues to build affordable housing in the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this is the deal they worked out. They're trying to retain the notion that that school district employees would gain some benefit from the pass through money. And the way they did that is by having it flow through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As Ms.. Potter explained, the housing authority does not build moderate income. It always was intended that there be low, very low and moderate income available to the school district employees. The housing authority can't doesn't control moderate. The city does throw inclusionary policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So this was the transaction that was negotiated between the school district and the housing authority with the blessing of the Department of Finance, to be able to retain that consideration and to keep those moneys flowing through to the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So you are being asked to assist, make that happen by allowing for this this portion of the moderate income housing to be made available to eligible employees of the school district. They still have to meet all the requirements, the eligibility requirements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So because of all of that, I do not believe there is anything improper, legally improper about doing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So none of that addressed my question. I'm sorry. My question goes to the relationship of you have a third of the bill, a third of the units being offered with the preference point. That is very valuable. I can look at this room.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In fact, I'm just going to ask, if you work for AUC, do you raise your hand? One person raised their hand. Okay. It's a percentage. It's a relatively small percentage of all of the people in our communities. They're looking for housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So but you are going to be giving a third of a preference point that is very valuable. It's 30%. And I'm looking for a relationship. I would think that there would have to be some sort of relationship between the percentage that we're offering these this preference point to and the number of units that are being built.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So let me just say one thing. We aren't giving 30% of the moderate income units at each project to our school district employees they up. That is the maximum amount that potentially could be qualified for. If there are zero unified school district employees who can qualify, all of those moderate income units will be available to other citizens'",
        "'speaker_8': 'in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that. But the cap is the maximum of 30%. But that's much greater than the number of people as the percentage of the people in our community that are seeking the sort of housing. And I'm trying to figure out how we came up with that relationship and if it is actually just arbitrary.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was a negotiation between the school district and the housing authority to try to honor the 1991 pass through agreement and the intention of that agreement. And that is the consideration that was arrived at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's not based on the number of new units that would be built or the number of employees from a U.S. city, anything like that. It's not based on numbers. It's based on something negotiated. So arbitrary, it appears.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. I'd like to make a motion because I don't want to lose $30 million that we've already paid taxes on. I'd like to make a motion that we follow the recommendation, amend this inclusionary housing, and we can take our chances with whatever might happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We lose that $30 million. We don't build any affordable housing with it. So to someone else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've all seconded the first, second and third seconds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will not be supporting this. I think it is critical that the city do outreach and figure out a way that there's actually a relationship between what's being offered and for the money that's being considered. And also that we know, in fact, that units are being built with that money.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that it is extremely valuable and I really appreciate the comment that on a USD board there is no one that qualifies for this and what the value of that is. And I will tell you, there's no one here on City Council that also participates in that, and I agree with the Speaker it is extremely valuable'",
        "'speaker_0': '. That being said, I'm going to go ahead and call to clarify all those. There has to be a role.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to do role.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Although some.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I. I. I.'",

    "Zero Waste Implementation Plan Update and Contract for Technical Assistance.": [
        "'speaker_1': 'Recommendation to support city efforts to attain a zero waste goal by approving update to zero waste implementation plan and authorizing the acting city manager to negotiate and execute a contract not to exceed 300,000, including contingency to conduct targeted technical assistance to commercial businesses, multifamily properties and adoption of related by budget resolution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Madame Mayor. Not present. Madam Vice Mayor and members of City Council virtually here. I'm Liz Acord, public works coordinator. I'm happy to answer any questions that there might be on this item, or staff is prepared to give a brief presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we do have two speakers on this. I don't know if the speakers wanted to go first or. Okay. I pulled the item because a concern of mine was the extension of the time to implement from, I believe, as 2020 to 2022.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you speak to that? Sure. Because I know the community is very enthusiastic and I was thought it was unfortunate that we're actually extending the time before we're going to try to meet these goals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I'm actually going to introduce Garth Schultz with our three consulting group to answer that question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening, honorable mayor. Nice to see you again. Councilmembers, staff and member of the public. I'm Garth Schulz, principal with our three principal analyst on the Zero Waste Implementation Plan Update. With respect to the recommendation to extend the goal date, it has to do with the fact that the trend lines that we see in these charts are'",
        "'speaker_7': 'included in. I believe the staff report and presentation indicates that even given the good improvements in diversion from landfill of much of the City of Alamitos waste stream over the last five years, if you extend that trend line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Based, describe what the extension is specifically to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Public. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's an extension of the achievement of your zero waste goal date from 2020 to 2022 by two years. And that's based on our evaluation of the progress that's been made significant and important progress over the past five years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you model that out over the next several years, it will be very challenging to hit the 2020 goal date, especially given that we are now midway through 2018 and have a couple of years yet to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So your proposal is to extend the goal date and then my concern would be, okay, why don't we actually just continue on that goal? Because how long has that been our goal?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Since 2010.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So this has been a goal for ten years that we've been trying to achieve. Now you're saying because we're two years away from that and, you know, it doesn't look like we're going to get there. That's extend that to more years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The reason is also so, yes, that is part of the analysis. The other reason is that in moving materials from your landfill waste containers into diversion such as recycling or composting or re-use or reduction. Each incremental next step is that much more challenging to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's the higher fruit up on the tree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that. But why wouldn't you say, okay, why don't we keep trying and come 2020 if we haven't made it, then we go ahead and we create a new goal as opposed to saying, Oh, we're two years away now, let's move the goal line, you know, because we're not getting there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I believe that would be at the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A different way of looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And I attended your meeting and we had this discussion and honestly, I believe in we had a ten year goal. I have nothing. I actually think it's good for our community to continue to try to reach that goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if in fact we don't meet that goal, then we set a new goal. But the idea that, you know, we're two years away and we don't want to face the fact that, you know, we maybe we need to push harder.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We just want to now we're having someone say, let's just push it over two more years and take the pressure off of us. I don't really I actually think I live in a community that's very enthusiastic and we can just try our hardest to ramp it up as opposed to keep moving the deadline.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I'm really afraid come 2022, I'll have someone or 2020 of someone stand in front of us up here and say, you know, let's push it over two more years. Again, it doesn't look like we're going to get there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yet, certainly at the council's discretion. Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And also I wanted to ask about there were concerns of in reducing the waste from multi-family units or commercial. And one of the suggestions was to charge extra, have someone actually come and go through the trash and recycling.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if there are things that aren't put in the right place to somehow do a fine. Is that one of the things that we would be agreeable to agreeing to at this time?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, it present the five key strategies that are pushing forward and not include that level of enforcement and administrative penalty. At this point in time. Really what's being looked at is a carrot based approach to really make sure that they have the right technical assistance, outreach and hand-holding support over these next several years to maximize their participation'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in the current programs that you've provided for via your contracts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, good. I appreciate that. And that's what I heard at the meeting. Sort of sticking with the carrot approach at this point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I want to go ahead and uh, if there's any council questions, otherwise, I'm going to go ahead and call speaker's office.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have two speakers, Rachel falsely and Ruth. Abby.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Rachel Bosley and I'm a senior program manager at Stop Waste or the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, and I oversee our agency's mandatory recycling ordinance. Councilmember Ody is on our board. And I just wanted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I wanted to mention that I am wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly and in support of this item. I think it will complement the enforcement and implementation of our mandatory ordinance. So we're doing a lot of the stick, at least on the businesses and you guys putting in the funds to be able to really provide that direct technical assistance to businesses'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and multifamily properties is a good complement to that. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Ruth. Abby.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any Mayor or members of the City Council. I'm Ruth happy with Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. We were a stakeholder in the outreach process for the Zero Waste Implementation Plan update and we are very supportive of the Council's approval of this agenda item with regards to the extension.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We really have a lot of wind behind our sails right now with regards to our new food water ordinance that took effect in January but is now being implemented. We were at Starbucks paper straws. We were at McDonald's paper straws.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You may have seen an announcement in Starbucks is going to, you know, phase it out worldwide. But Alameda has been a leader to push in that direction. And so we really feel as though this momentum has started and that there is a lot of enthusiasm in the community, but we're going to take a little bit more time'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to do it right. And I'm afraid that if we rush it, we will be we will resort to things that we wouldn't want to see in order to reduce our trash to landfill, such as saying giving up and saying, oh, multifamily, can't recycle, so we'll sort their trash for them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We think that's the wrong direction. We think the right direction is the outreach and technical assistance and zero waste. Culture Change Course has recently received a grant from the Altamont Education Advisory Board to help the city in developing zero waste block leaders, to help all the neighborhoods of the city with resources to recycle and compost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we feel like we need a little bit more time for that carrot before the stick and for the zero waste culture change before we give up on our meetings and say We'll sort your trash for you. So we very much support your adoption of this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks. Thank you. Staff, can you let me know where we are in relation to other cities in regards to hitting our are the cities trying to do 2020 or where are they? Are there 28 teams out there?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Excellent question. I have yet to see a 2018. Most of the original goal dates that were adopted over the course of the last 5 to 10, even 15 years, were for 2020. To my knowledge, most of those that have a 2022 goal date are going to have a bit of a reckoning come up in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In terms of that achievement, more of the more recent adoptions I've seen have been around 2025 or even 2030 or other outward dates. You are certainly a leader in the pack with your current zero waste implementation plan. This update doesn't make you any less of a leader in any way and in fact continues that track progress and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'good success.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Member already I just want to make a quick comment and I appreciate Rachel Cumming coming over for the meeting. As she mentioned, I do represent the city on Stop Waste and you know, the multifamily and the commercial. It was a little bit behind the single family.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we're seeing that these numbers in some of these similar numbers and other communities across the county. So one of the primary objectives we have is to do more education and more outreach. So I think that's a very effective tool and I would like to move approval of the item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will seconding other comments. Comments? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you say you want to have more pending?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I didn't want to cut you off.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'He he made the motion and I'll second. But I also want to make my comments. Member Ashcraft, thank you very much for the report from our consultant and also to Ruth. Abby of Casa. Wherever you just went, I can't say enough about what community rockstars casa is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They have really been leaders. They've pushed, they've pulled, they've gotten the city to move in a great direction. And so I take I mean, and also the lady from subways, but I take huge stock, if that's Ruth Abby's recommendation, that is good enough for me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I wholeheartedly support this resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other comments remember matter.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'd like us to keep our original target and try harder. Uh, there's I'm in full support of the activities that are listed here, but I think we have to drive to a goal. If we let it slip, it'll stifle creativity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It'll stifle our appeal to have people use less so that we don't have to. If you use less, you have to divert less. So I think we need to drive harder. And if we don't make the target, then we do an analysis to figure out what where the gaps are and keep that in mind as we go'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So I'm I'm all for the the mechanics that are here. But let's keep the goal where it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I really appreciate that comment. Thank you. Remember matter, I think. Let me hear from our vice mayor. Vice mayor. I don't. He can hopefully you can hear us now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I can I. I would also like I like to keep goals. I think that it's important. I get that we may there may be some roadblocks actually getting there. But I think if we if we keep those dates there, we can make the assessments about what we need to do and make changes over time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do appreciate the work on this, and I'm ready for this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a vice mayor. Does that mean yours? I couldn't I couldn't hear at the end.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That she's ready to support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm ready to support this. Tonight, I would like to just keep the goals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Originally set them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Though. Okay. So then the motion was to actually do the 2022, but I heard at least three of us that would like the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To do everything, keep it at 2020.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can amend my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which I can make a friendly amendment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I'm just going to amend it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're going to amend it. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So to reflect keeping the goal in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Be coming back and looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then remember, you were the second to do so on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I was traumatic and I just think that there's extra staff time that we don't need to. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a member matter as he seconded the motion. You're going to call the question. So I guess I call the question. But then she actually calls the roll and now I'll call the question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Helps my her as the no matter I. I O.D. yes to.'",
