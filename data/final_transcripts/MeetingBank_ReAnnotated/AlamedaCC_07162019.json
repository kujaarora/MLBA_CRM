    "Preliminary Public Hearing on Draft Climate Action and Resiliency Plan and Environmental Review.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. I am Liam Garland, a public works director here in the city of Alameda. And I'm really excited tonight about this draft action, alameda Climate Action and Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This plan, we think from the state side, we think it's ready. Oh, it reflects a lot of what the community has shared with us and has many revisions since the draft that was shared publicly in May. But not only that, that's on top of a robust community engagement process that was started at the beginning of this plan'",
        "'speaker_7': '. So if you look at this slide that gives you an overview of the process, you'll see that we had three community input sessions and in fact one of those sessions was really three meetings in different parts of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had a task force from the beginning of the plan that was comprised of various stakeholders from the business community, from the environmental groups, from even some homeowner's association associations who might be affected by this plan. We also convened an interdepartmental team inside of city government called a Green Team and had Community Action for Sustainable Alameda participate'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on that green team. And finally, we've been working with regional agencies, our partner neighbors and climate experts, including consultants at the Eastern Research Group who've supported us through the process. And I think over the last 24 to 48 hours, you've seen some of those stakeholders weigh in on the plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, staff think it's ready, but we're ready to hear whether that's true or not. And so the number one goal for tonight is to hear from the public and hear from the council about your thoughts about the plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the thoughts are mostly positive and there's not many changes to be made and those aren't significant, then we'll be back on September 2nd for the final action to adopt the plan. If the suggested revisions are major, well, then the timeline gets more uncertain and we go out into the later fall and or winter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Speaking of time, we don't have a ton tonight, so we've got a hard stop around seven given everything that's on the council docket. And we've got some public speakers tonight who I know want I want to share their comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the staff presentation is going to be really short tonight. The plan in one form or another has been out for a couple of months and we're keeping our presentation short. Let me just share two more comments. One is staff is already focused on implementation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you look at the budget that City Council adopted recently that had more than $3 million in projects and programs consistent with the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan. If you look at tonight's agenda, we've got a climate impact section of each of those staff reports.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've also got an item on consent for the beginning, the active transportation plan process on regular agenda. We've got there's the question of whether to take the next step to explore a new stormwater fee that could essentially help implement some measures related to sea level rise and climate change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in tonight's agenda, you can see the Climate Action or resiliency plan in action. I do want to call out a couple groups and people right now, which is Community Action for Sustainable Alameda. They've been a part of this process from the beginning, not even the beginning of this, but the beginning of the Local Action Plan for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Climate Protection back in 2008. They've been a key community partner throughout the process and deserve a ton of praise in terms of getting us to where we are tonight. In addition, Aaron Smith, who you're going to hear from in just a moment, and Patrick Pellegrini oday, they've helped turn this climate plan into something that I at least'",
        "'speaker_7': 'am really proud of. So I just want to thank them before I turn it over to Aaron for the remainder of the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Galan. I like that you're wearing a green blouse. I think that's symbolic of us in spirit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Vice Mayor, members of the Council. It is great to be before you presenting Almeida's first Climate Action and Resiliency Plan. The presentation that you have in the meeting packet for this evening tells.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A young climate enthusiast.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Very young tells the presentation, and the packet tonight tells an important and compelling story that culminates in the draft plan before you this evening. It conveys the challenges we face with an evolving climate. And ends with actions, specific actions the city can take to build resiliency in the face of sea level rise and other climate hazards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As Leon mentioned, tonight is about hearing from you, from other agencies and the public. And so with that, I will only tell a condensed version of that story, touching on key content of the plan that will set the stage for the discussion that will follow.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So as Liam mentioned, the Climate Action Resiliency Plan is an update to our 28 Local Action Plan for Climate Protection. However, now it's with an expanded and integrated approach that includes both greenhouse gas reduction and climate adaptation. This integrated approach is what the state calls almeida's climate safe path.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let me explain. The graph shown here in the right has a time on the horizontal axis and degrees of global warming on the vertical. The two different red and blue lines represent different greenhouse gas emission pathways. The red being a high emissions pathway or business as usual.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No major global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The blue represents a lower emissions pathway. And what this demonstrates is the direct impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the degrees of warming, which are explicitly linked to the severity of sea level rise storms and other known climate hazards.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Aluminum cases. The actions in this plan tonight directly reduce local almeida's greenhouse gas reductions. It's also intended to set example for other municipalities in the hopes of catalyzing change at the global scale, which, if successful, leads us on, or at least near that blue emissions pathway, since there's a lot of uncertainty in how this will unfold.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To be climate safe today, we have to minimize risk from climate hazards that are shown on that high emissions pathway and and allow for an iterative planning process. And we coined this as adaptive management in the plan. What this allows is to plan for a worst case scenario today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But as time unfolds, emissions reduce. Predictive models refine. We are continuously modern monitoring and able to revise our adaptive approach. The carp, I'm going to call it the carp acronym. The Carp Vision and Goals captures the sentiment of climate safe planning, and it's the result of significant input and feedback from the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as you'll hear, the vision was modified for consistency with council's recent declaration of a climate emergency. Alameda will be an innovative leader in achieving net zero carbon emissions and community resilience as soon as possible and serve as an example that inspires similarly impacted cities to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our community members will be a vital part of this ongoing process. The Carp also identifies eight specific targeted goals one for greenhouse gas reduction, one for each of the climate hazards known that we know are in our future, and another for effective implementation and capacity building in regards to greenhouse gas reductions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We started this process with an emissions inventory that we used to be able to assess the progress in meeting the goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions 25% below 2005 levels. That target was set in 2008. We also conducted the emissions inventory to be able to set further looking and further reducing goals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The analysis did confirm a 23% reduction from 2005 levels in 2020, just shy of the stated goal. It's now time to look towards 2030 and the smokestack shown on the right in orange represents what Alameda is. Greenhouse gas emissions would be in 2030 under a business as usual scenario or no proactive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The smoke stack on the right, the upper half blue or really gray as shown here tonight. The upper half represents those needed 50% reductions. And the first notch, as you can see, there's kind of a lighter blue color that's reductions from actions already committed to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this represents an enormous amount of work that still needs to be done. And that work is captured in the Transportation Choices Plan, the zero waste implementation plan, update, our urban forestry program, and AMP's continued delivery of zero or of clean or zero carbon power.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But that's not enough. And as shown below the lighter blue notch, the 41,700, that is, additional emissions needed to reach a 50% reduction. And I failed to say that 50% reduction that we've set for 2030 is more aggressive than that set by the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have to acknowledge it's only a step towards carbon neutrality. So the additional actions that are noted in the gray section, that's where the Caap really puts its emphasis. Given AMP's delivery of clean up, clean power. Ah, excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry. Our emissions are predominantly from fossil fuel use in the transportation sector, as well as natural gas use in the building sector. For transportation, the plan focuses first on how we can get deeper cuts in vehicle miles traveled or further and encourage mode shift from that in the Transportation Choices plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It secondly looks at how we can expand electric vehicle adoption and the charging station that needs to go with that in the building sector. The emphasis is primarily on getting rid of debt, reducing natural gas use. And there's two approaches.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's the existing building stock, and that means fuel switching. So switching appliances that currently use natural gas to those that are electric. And then, of course, doing any necessary upgrades to the electrical panel to be able to support that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It also means a commitment to all electric for new residential development. And it also these actions here. I don't want to. I definitely want to make mention that these, coupled with energy conservation and distributed rooftop solar, are certainly a pathway towards a more resilient Alameda sequestration, which is the drawdown of carbon from the atmosphere since some emissions'",
        "'speaker_8': 'will likely continue. Sequestration allows a means to reach that carbon neutrality and the carp commits on the sequestration front to expansions in our urban forestry program, as well as the application of compost as a soil amendment in our parks and open spaces while doing our part to set the globe on that lower emissions pathway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We are also planning to manage risk that is predicted under our current climate emergency. We already are experiencing climate change impacts here in Alameda. For those that have gone out at a king tide, you can see our shorelines, blooming periods of drought, poor air quality from wildfire.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These are expected to get more frequent and more severe. Adapting and building resilience to climate change is essential for the long term health of the community. This planning process we looked at and characterized existing and future conditions for known climate hazards, and I'll read these here and they're noted on the slide, which is sea level rise and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'storm surge, extreme heat, inland flooding, and that's for more frequent and intense storms, wildfire fires, which for us is predominantly poor air quality drought and liquefaction. So groundwater rising can lead to an increased incident and impact from liquefaction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We took this characterization of existing and future conditions and conducted a vulnerability assessment to understand exposure as well as the adaptive capacity of the community and our built environment. And from that, we were able to target and develop strategies and actions at the asset and citywide scale as a low lying island city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sea level rise in flooding is a very real and tangible risk. As such, the plan presents 11 priority locations or asset groups where a specific and deeper dove was done to understand the extent of flooding in impact and to develop site specific strategies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The plan then provides general strategies to build resilience by sector. These are more best management practices and aren't necessarily location specific, but they are to be integrated citywide and in an effort to build both the public and environment, build resiliency against climate change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm going to get into those 11 locations to help organize the enormity of this analysis. We used a framework of prioritizing that which is impacted soonest and with greatest consequence. And so for Alameda. Significant shoreline overtopping is seen at 24 and 36 inches of sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a scenario that's expected mid to late century daily, but could occur today if a 50 year storm were to be experienced. So by targeting that impacted soonest and with greatest consequence, we're actually managing risk that's real and present today while allowing more time to unfold in the hopes that that global greenhouse gas emissions truck trajectory'",
        "'speaker_8': 'does shift down lower. So shown here in the 11 priority sites, the pink hatched polygons that you're seeing are areas that are are already being addressed in another plan. For instance, the Alameda Point Master Infrastructure Plan, as well as being addressed in new developments like those shown on the northern waterfront, the Climate Action Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Did not set out to reinvent those plans, but rather incorporate the work that's already being done. I'm not going to read off just for the sake of time. That's a visual of where those 11 locations are. But I do think it's super important to mention here that climate change knows no borders and that Alameda can't and shouldn't'",
        "'speaker_8': 'solve this in a vacuum. So Doolittle Drive, shown as number eight on the right, presents a really good example. So we have Caltrans, the city of Oakland, the Port East Bay Regional Park District, and the city, among other agencies, very vested and have a vested interest in a multi benefit solution to the height of Doolittle, which at'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about 36 inches of sea level rise, becomes deficient in terms of flood protection. So it's essential that Alameda attracts the evolving landscape of local, state, county governance structures related to both mitigation and adaptation, and possibly seek leadership opportunities that may help shear steer the formation of those structures and policies to ensure an effective launch.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The plan lays out specific, implementable, implementable actions for the first five years shown here is phase one, which covers the first two years, includes the hiring of a sustainability coordinator, reconvening of the green team that Leon mentioned, as well as the task force.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Among the other items listed, the CAAP underscores the importance of monitoring and annual reporting, not only to evaluate the efficacy of the actions implemented, but to maintain, maintain transparency with the public, allow an opportunity for the Council to change and adjust course as needed, and of course to adapt to the changing conditions at year 2024.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So about five years in, it is slated for an update to our greenhouse gas emissions as well as a more comprehensive update to the plan. And with that, that ends my very condensed version of the story, and I hope that you all had time to read the full story in your packet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Lisbeth. Very nice. And did you have more you want to add?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Only that we've got about eight public speakers just to help in terms of the management of topics.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I was going to find out first if we had any clarifying questions that the council wanted to ask before we launched into our public speakers. Anybody want to ask clarifying questions? Yeah. Councilmember Daisuke.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So one of the biggest, you know, communications that I've got from a variety of people through a variety of sources, has been about the congestion pricing, particularly the tolls through the through the Webster tube, posi tube. Now, my reading of the materials, I didn't see it related to any policy strategies or actions, although I saw it within'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the text, referenced within the text or referenced within. I forgot what the term was, key items or something like that at the end. So what? So is it correct to say that it's not part of policy strategies or actions that are part.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of the both?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure, there's two answers to that. One is in the projection of where we would be in 2030 if the measures that we've laid out to get to our 50% cut goal congestion pricing is not one of the measures that's required to get to that 50% cut.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, given Almeida's vision is to get to or proposed division is to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. And the context of that, then what the COP suggests is to continue the discussion of congestion pricing because there are significant greenhouse gas reduction benefits through such a strategy.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Does that make sense? And I guess or let me say, David, does that answer the question? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anyone else? Anything else? Councilmember O.D.. I'm trying to read your expression.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I wanted to be quick. Just last quick question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For Mr. Garland. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So on the staff report you listed, you know, the adaptation and the different asset categories and referenced the table and carp. So these were some of the the areas that needed work. So the veterans card, we've funded that in the last budget or in this upcoming budget, right?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Veteran's Court. So again, for each of the 11 locations, there's near mid and long term strategies that are presented. So that which was funded or partially funded is the near term, which is the raising of the road at Veterans Court.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And then I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves, but we have the storm.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then tonight before you was funding of which is another. One of the 11 items is funding of the storm capacity upgrades.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So we're, you know, again, not getting ahead of ourselves, but we've already started.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On at least two of the yes priority areas. Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. We're ready to a comment. Okay. So we have eight speakers. So that means 2 minutes apiece?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So when you hear your name called because they didn't close in, call a few at a time, just be ready to scoot out to the aisle and we'll keep things moving along.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So the first three are. Mia Ketterer, Kelly Malinowski, Pat Potter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. I am a caterer from Stop Waste. We are the Alameda County Waste Management Authority, Source Reduction, Recycling Board and Energy Council. We have programs that align with the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan, and our board's recently adopted priorities that specifically focus on climate protection.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've been helping Alameda County jurisdictions with Climate Action Planning since 2008 and have been reviewing the recent updates of plans. So our perspective is informed by that, and we want to commend you for reaching this point. If anything, we've seen the climate action planning process is not easy or simple.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you for your leadership. You are one of the first cities in Alameda County to get to the post 2020 Climate Action Action Planning Outcomes. We support your 50% reduction target for 2030. It is in alignment with other Alameda County jurisdictions and is in the more ambitious half of those jurisdictions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We applaud the inclusion specifically of consumption based emissions, which really are all of the global emissions related to the things that we consume from our Waste Management Authority perspective. This is really important and it also empowers residents to do more to affect climate change globally.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It also promises more accessible and equitable solutions than many of the traditional climate action strategies. We also support key strategies that are in the Climate Action Plan and Resiliency Plan that align with our board priorities, specifically each one electrifying existing buildings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is a critical piece to reaching deep decarbonization in the building sector and aligns with our Energy Council priorities and S-1 sequestration, which uses compost in the most climate beneficial way. So again, we thank you. And we we look forward to working with you and supporting you in the implementation of this ambitious plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next is Kelly and then Pat Potter and then Damien Mason. Hey, wait until you're ready. Good evening, Madam Chair. And members of the board. My name is Kalman Koski. I'm from the California State Coastal Conservancy, non regulatory grantmaking state agency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Climate change is already having significant and widespread impacts on California's economy and environment, and local governments have an important role to play to reduce emissions. And you're also at the forefront of efforts to adapt to the ongoing anticipated effects of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In 2007, we incorporated our climate change considerations into our strategic planning. 2009 we adopted a policy. 2012 The Governor empowered us with specific legislation to plan for and adapt to the impacts of climate. And that's when we launched our climate ready program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have since funded 57 climate projects across the state to the tune of 10.7 million. But we like to say we've been doing adaptation since the seventies with wetland restoration and the San Francisco Bay. We have studied and supported this countywide sea level rise assessments from Marin County, San Mateo County.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We worked with Alameda County. We've done assessments that Crissy Field, SFO, and most recently we've enjoyed working with Liam and Patrick and our staff in the city of Alameda to review and provide input and the caap and and most jurisdictions in the San Francisco Bay have just done seal rise vulnerability assessments and they're kind of transitioning to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'look at other hazards, transitioning to look at adaptation strategies. So in this way, the city of Alameda is in a leader. You guys are kind of ahead of the game, including those 11 priority areas for sea level rise and including specific adaptation strategies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You guys are really leading the charge, so congratulations. Thank you so much for being so forward thinking and innovative and we really appreciate you guys kind of taking the lead in the region and we're looking forward to working together with you to implement these strategies.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As we are a natural resources agency, we always have a preference for the nature based green staff. But here to support you as a partner. And thank you so much for your leadership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much for coming. And while there is a lot to commend in what we're hearing, we do have this rule that we don't do applause or any other sort of interruptions, just keep things moving along. So I know it's tempting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Pat Potter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bicycling and walking are the only forms of transportation that do not pollute. And so I feel it is important to emphasize these forms of transportation in the pursuit of our emissions reduction goals. Carp strategy to convert drivers from fossil fueled cars to electric cars, resulting in 12% of Alameda in driving EVs in ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our real goal should be to get 40% more Alameda biking and walking. To do this, start with replicating Karp's Electric Vehicle Promotion Campaign found on page 30. Implement communications and outreach activities to promote the acquisition of bicycles. Promote a retail price rebate for each new bicycle offered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Discounts at shops and restaurants for people who ride their bikes to them. There are 10,000 kilometers who cannot drive a car but who can bike and walk. We should be supporting those people by providing safe, protected bike lanes throughout the island and by helping them develop good biking skills.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we do, by the time we reach our targeted emission reduction goal in ten years, these alamy and the ones who come after them will more likely ride a bike around the island than want to buy an electric car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What else will get 40% of all means on to bikes? Adequately fund bike racks in all locations where people gather. Promote shared vehicle programs for bikes. Electric bikes and electric scooters. Transform some car parking spaces into bike and scooter parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Prioritize building the bicycle pedestrian bridge across the street where between West Alameda and Oakland, where there is a glaring gap in the bike network. In order to accomplish what Karp is setting out. We need to look through the lens of a city like Amsterdam, where 58% of the population over 12 rides a bicycle.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought I had 3 minutes. I had it down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you did? You did well, but I'll.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mail it to you. Okay?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, there is more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We have Damian Mason, Elizabeth Green, then William Smith.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council and members of city staff. I'm Damian Mason, Almaty, native member of Community Action for Sustainable Alameda and co-founder of the Climate Restoration Circle of San Francisco Bay. I want to thank everyone who's worked so hard on this plan and encouraged City Council to adopt and implement it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We must imagine, embrace and build new pathways to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible. In so doing, will help to grow a better future for us all. Alameda imparts almost everything off island. This is a quote from the executive summary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And our consumption based emissions from the goods and services we buy are much higher per person than our production based emissions. This means consumption based emissions create one of the best opportunities for Alameda to make a difference in our carbon footprint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One key to this is local production and local consumption, starting with our food. This would be a big step to reduce our city's consumption based carbon footprint toward our new climate emergency goal of zero emissions. Repair, reuse and buying local durable goods are good steps.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I find reducing food waste feeding our kitchen my kitchen scraps to my worm bin. Folks that have built compost bins, chicken coops, beehives planted fruit trees and raised beds for organic gardening are some of the most exciting ways we can all make a big impact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city of Alameda can boost these efforts by turning all of our public parks and city open spaces into maximum carbon sinks with pulse grazing livestock instead of gas mowers and leaf blowers. We can integrate regenerative garden living soil labs into all of our K-through-12 schools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can integrate regenerative oh, sorry. We can plant a ten or more acres of food forest along the Cross Alameda Trail, currently in construction or at the College of Alameda and install climate victory community gardens with surplus food so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Elizabeth. You can give it to the Smith and Mark Perlin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Yes, my name is Elizabeth Green. I'm an architectural historian, retired from the state of California. I submitted this comment online in May. But I regarding this issue that I'll talk about in the Karp Report, but I haven't seen it addressed online in any of the comments or documents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I want to draw your attention to a problem that's hidden in the fine print of Chapter three, page 36. Table three, dash six. It's called new GHG emissions reduction actions for energy use in the building sector. It has a supplemental actions box at the bottom of the table and in the supplemental actions box.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second bulleted item reads Draft Zoning Code Amendment to facilitate facility reduction in energy use by exempting energy efficient windows and doors from the design review process. I can find no explanation or justification for this action in the report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The proposal to exempt energy efficient Windows and doors from Design Review is inconsistent with Alamitos Municipal Code. This long standing city policy already allows exemption from design review for windows and doors, not on a front or street side elevation, which don't alter the character defining features of the building and which are a good visual match for the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'original item being replaced. However, to completely exempt all energy efficient windows and doors from any design review could result in alterations which would damage the architectural integrity of almeida's beloved historic buildings and neighborhoods. Furthermore, energy efficient windows and doors are readily available on the market in dimensions, proportions, details and styles that are compatible with the original styles'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of Almeida's historic buildings. So that compliance with design review is within reach of homeowners. Title 24 already requires that Windows and doors be an energy efficient. It's difficult to comprehend the reason for this action.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much. I also request that you revise the mitigations subject.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Mark Perlin and Ruth Abbe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good. Late afternoon, everyone. My name is Mark Furlan. I'm representing the climate restoration circle. Thank you there. And Aaron Smith used the term mode shift. And as a alum of Alameda High, which I represent on my t shirt and like Damien mason, Amelia Earhart, there needs to be a mode shift.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And yeah, I'm in support of the plan. But yeah, there's a site known as Doolittle Drive in the name of Jimmy Doolittle, which I always felt was really ironic because Jimmy Doolittle did so much. And that's kind of the mode shift connection I want to make between what's taken place here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tolls on the Webster Tube Bridge. We get our tunnel. We need to think about really mode shifting and doing something more proactive instead of monetizing, you know, the the what's going on here. It's that Alameda is in a unique position.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a lot to be fortunate for and we need to ask more of all of y'all. I'd like to see all tape and notes at these meetings. I take notes when I speak and about topics involving the climate because I'm so fiercely passionate about implementation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll leave you with two points of implementation. Every parking lot in Alameda that has ten or more spots must have electric vehicle charging. So LNG needs to go. Electric vehicles need to come in. They don't have to be infrastructure connected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can be off grid and I'll yield the rest of my time to the board who I'm sure would like to speak more. Thank you so much.'",

Abby from Community Action for Sustainable Alameda CASA was actually formed as a partnership with the city and the community to put the community action into the city's climate goals. And for the last ten years, we've been a partner with the city Alameda Municipal Power and Alameda Unified School District in implementing the goals of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city's Climate Action Plan. We have been very closely involved with the city. In the end, the development of the new Climate Action and Resiliency Plan, and we wholeheartedly recommend adoption of this plan. In activist circles, we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Say that we are always satisfied, always happy, never satisfied. We are very happy with this plan. We are not satisfied.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that's because there will be more planning coming up. There will be an annual process for updating of the plan and to reach the goals of the city's climate emergency declaration. Very specifically, there will be a climate, there will be an active transportation plan that's on your agenda tonight, which we're extremely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excited about and we are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very excited about the update to the city's street tree plan, which we believe should be a urban forestry plan. So we will be partners with the city in the development of those plans and work closely with you and your staff in the development of those plans.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And that was our last speaker. Okay. Well, I'm going to open it up for a council discussion, but I just want to start by saying a huge thank you, especially to you pioneers. Ruth Abby, who just spoke, was one of them for years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't see Debbie Ryan in the audience, but we do allow people to take vacations in the summer. But we really are a better city and able to make the kind of progress we're making because we have some excellent, dedicated staff, but we also have some amazingly talented, impressive members of the community who all just spoke'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I'm just always so grateful that you take your time to attend these meetings, organize events. I if I'm ever leaving my office late on the evening that Cossa meets, I look into the room and you've got, you know, 25 people around that table and I mean month after month and this has been going on for years'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So thank you all for helping make us a better, more resilient city. So with that, who would like to start off with comments? Um, is it, is, is the baby at a good place where you want to speak or you want to not disturb him?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, you wait. Let's start. Okay. So, Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks. I'll start then. First of all, I want to echo the mayor's comments she just made and give a great debt of thanks and appreciation to everyone who worked so hard on this. I would have to agree with with Liam in your opening remarks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's rare to give one minus suggestion, but I'll get to that. You know, also give a shout out to COSLA for all their work. And they were the impetus, if I remember correctly, for actually accelerating this. We had had this on our plan to do I think starting now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And thanks to referral by my former colleague Mr. Matarese and CASA's leadership, we were able to get this done early and you know, it's really not early because, you know, we're on the front lines of climate change, so it's kind of late, but you know, it's early according to the plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, you know, the one overarching comment I would want to say is, you know, let's not make let's make sure we don't put this on the shelf and let it sit like other plans we've done. So we need to implement this and we and we need to prioritize it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So funding is always going to be an issue for me. So I'm particularly curious on the different ways that we can find to fund this, and I really appreciate it has, as Mr. Smith mentioned, you know, the equity component that's running throughout throughout the Climate Action Plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I really appreciated that because that's a priority of mine. So just going through really quickly, you know, on the greenhouse gas thing, I mean, the composting, I don't know if anyone many people have heard of the the Marin Carbon Project and I saw Mia there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, I'm on the subway support and we're really proud and excited about about what benefits come from composting on a large scale. I mean, just mind boggling the benefits that that, you know, major composting has. And, you know, we look at our parks and all of them are grass.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so maybe it's time we start thinking about doing other ways of parks, you know, composting and things like that. When we talk about electronic vehicles, you know, I think Pat Potter made made the point, you know, it's not just changing to electric vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We actually have to reduce the amount of cars on our street. So I think that was the the goal of our transportation plan. You know, one, reducing trips, you know, in to reducing emissions. So let's not lose sight of the the reducing trips.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So whether it's doing things for bicycles or finding ways to incentivize people to get out of their cars, I think that's something we need to make sure we prioritize. You know, buildings are probably the biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So Berkeley just did their, you know, all new construction is electric. So I think that's that's something good that we need to we need to think about. On adapting. Oh, also, you know, a lot of times when we have plans and, you know, we focus on parking.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if you build parking, people are going to drive. If you don't build parking, people are going to find other ways to get there. So I think we need to deemphasize parking, you know, when we we put together these these major projects and these plans.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So that's something I think I've mentioned before. So on adapting like I ask the question and thanks Heron for asking. You know, some of these projects are underway. The Veterans Court, you know hopefully will do make a decision on the storm storm water situation today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have an infrastructure bond which I'm sure will come back. I've said all along, I think that the entire infrastructure bond should be devoted to sea level rise because we're really going to have a hard time finding a way to pay for it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, to me, it's more important that we deal with this issue than some of the other things that that we've talked about in the infrastructure cost, the funding plan, this climate fund. I'm interested to learn more about the Climate Fund proposal that was in there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And my one thing I would add, and I've kind of been harping on this for five years, you know, wetlands mitigation bank, I mean, that's a way to restore wetlands and at the same time generate revenue that we can use to pay for some of these these projects.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I know we put that in our toolbox not to look at it and, you know, not not to not to implement it, but just to keep it there. I think we need to move it more to the forefront, especially, you know, seeing the cost that we have.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then on the implementation, again, you know, let's not put it on the shelf and let it sit there. We need to work on that. And our council, I think, took a great step under the vice mayor's leadership to declare a climate emergency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think it's incumbent on all of us to make sure that we do keep this front and center and that we do focus on this. We don't let it sit on the shelf. And it's up to you to hold us accountable and make sure that we do so.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thanks very much for everyone in the community and on staff for all their hard work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Brody, Councilman de SAG.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the effort put towards this. What I like most, especially about the Climate Action Plan before us, is the section having to do with building resilience, dealing with the particularly the goals having to deal with a sea level rise and the flood flooding, inland flooding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also the different goals having to do with the excessive. Things like that. What I am concerned about, though, is the part the part on the GHG emissions, particularly as it relates to the tolls and also as it relates to basically undoing Measure A, which the people of Alameda had put together with regard to the tolls.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the if the intention of the tolls on on Webster the posi tube is to encourage people to do electric vehicles. It seems to me that several trends are emerging and they're emerging faster than we think. And the trains have to do with more people taking either electric vehicles, more people not owning cars anymore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so more people ride, share, car sharing. So the notion of having to do a tolls in order to do to negatively affect behavior, I think that's pretty heavy handed on the part of City Hall, quite frankly. So I don't support tolls.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't support the congestion pricing. And I'm very concerned about the effort to undermine Measure A if you're going to undermine measure, then you need to be clear what measure is what the history of it is, how it's been protecting our neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you can't just, you know, use this this emergency in order to undo it. You can certainly encourage, if you howsoever you want, encourage it. But you have to give a full picture of what Measure A is all about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I and I didn't see that full picture when, when it came to the discussion on the GST discussion. So I like the part about the building resilience. I'm very concerned about the part about GHG emissions, particularly as it relates to the tolls and as it relates to Measure A, I think the point raised by the resident'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Elizabeth Green is an important point. There are historic buildings that you can't just, you know, willy nilly decide to put the wrong kind of windows and change the rules to to facilitate that. I think we have to respect the fact that we have an architectural history in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At the end of the day, this, after all, is still the city of homes and beaches. So so I have problems with one part. I like the other part.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if I may ask, just by way of discussion, can you count some everyday? So help us understand what you mean by this attempt to undermine misery using the climate emergency.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, it's right here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These talks about. Building more. On land on chapter three, page 32, we talked about creating higher and higher density, the need to change zoning to allow it's right there at the first bullet point changed zoning to allow more multi-family use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also we found loose if you want to if you want to do that, then you have to be explicit. All I'm saying is be explicit and talk about that. You have to undo a measure. You have to undo the the number of units that are allowed on on a parcel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you also have to undo measure as a result, as it relates to accessory dwelling units, you can't just you know, and I think that that this needs to speak. If you're going to if you want to undo measure eight, then you need to talk about it in a clear way so that the people know and they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'can make their decision based on eyes wide open.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Vice Mayor, ready to go next?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So I'd like to start by giving my strong appreciation to our staff for when I was glad to hear from one of our not partners, but somebody who's been working with you calling me innovative and forward thinking and probably one of the most forward thinking plans in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I agree. I was proud to tell some people I work with about it the other day and they were all quite impressed with the work that you guys have all done. And it ultimately we have a fantastic community and whatever else but that the city team that has worked hard to put together this document really deserves a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'lot of credit. So I want to make sure that that's very clear. I'll tell the story. I think I may have told it here before when I was on the planning board and the first ship that Liam was asked to bring forward for approval came forward after he became acting public works director came forward and had a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'climate action section in it. And in that in that document, it literally stated that the city's climate policy was that this is a regional issue. There's nothing the city can do about it. And so we're not going to do anything.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I called them and I was like, Hey, this seems a little funny. We live in a region we need to plug in, we need to do some things. And he said, You know, I missed that. Somebody else wrote this document before I became the acting public works director and literally changed it right there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And by the time we got to the planning board a week later, that had been erased. And I think it was a change in direction for the city that really let this here. I want to be clear, the change is staff's willingness to engage and understand this issue and actually see it as something that was important, needed'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to be spent time and fine to grant funding to do so much appreciation. I mean, unless I hear some significant changes being proposed in this document tonight, I almost wonder why we wouldn't be approving this rather than just giving comments and asking for it to come back in September.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have a couple of comments. I think they can be addressed even after approval. I would like to see the Climate Emergency Declaration added to this document. I think when we approve the climate declaration, we actually approved it with the idea that it was supposed to be more or less the preamble to this document, setting up the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the overall, why are we doing this? And so that was kind of the commitment we made to the community as well. How are we doing this? How does it all fit in? Don't worry, this will be the preamble to that document.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'd like to see that right at the beginning before after the acknowledgments is fine. I think we can be a little clearer in the document. Again, these are just small changes. But regarding the timeline for 36 inches of sea level rise, our city address addresses sea level rise in a lot of different places with a lot'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of different numbers. And so the timeframe really matters. And at least in the version which I read, the original public version, the revised version. So if it if it did get changed, I apologize. I didn't see it. It was not it never said actually 36 inches of sea level rise by such and such a date just kept'",
        "'speaker_6': 'using 36. And I think we should be clear about that. I really appreciate it. So this is going to be a multipronged point, but I really appreciate all the language in this that does address the importance of mode shift and the kind of prioritizing of mode shift over electrification of our transportation system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It says that electrification is important and we have to do it to get there. But that I mean, you know, CARB, the state already recognizes that we're going to need to see a 15 to 25% reduction in VMT in order to meet our climate goals over and above electrification for electrification of the transportation system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think that's really important. One place and I've raised this with staff, there are some staffing costs in here that identify about four FTE is towards electrifying our vehicles, incentivizing, building the infrastructure, etc. for EVs. I'm not arguing with that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to the point that one of our speakers made earlier, I think there was an assumption that the transportation choices plan kind of dealt with that in its other place. If the idea is that the Transportation Choices plan actually identifies new positions to make sure that we are going above and beyond the work that our current staff'",
        "'speaker_6': 'can do, I think we and I'm pretty confident it doesn't and I see Andrew Thomas's head shaking. I do think we need to think about whether or not we are being actually as aggressive, if we are not staffing up our transportation team to match the work that needs to be done, whether or not we're being as aggressive'",
        "'speaker_6': 'actually in intention with. The multi-modal work. I understand that that this is this is I really appreciate the hey, it's going to take staff to do this work and this is how much and that was the intent it wasn't day you know, just hire these four people and we're done.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I would like to see somewhere where instead of it's saying not applicable to the transportation choices stuff in here related to staffing that it might actually identify the staffing we need to really get the work done. I really I'm excited about the groundwater study.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I actually feel like that's another thing that we are we need to do but is going to be groundbreaking and also really important in helping us think about how we mitigate long term. And I really want to I want to appreciate that it's in there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just make sure that it's something that comes forward pretty, pretty quick and pretty soon because it could change the way that we're thinking about long term mitigation. Great point about the drought and its connections through East Bay mud to our water use and etc..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would like to see if we can sometime along the next six months or whatever else, talk about some policy encouragement that the Council could send to East Bay mud whereby their pricing is better, incentivizing reduction of reduced water and not overly supporting east of the hills water users who use 2 to 3 times as much water'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and pay very little for the extra water they're using that here. It's a very difficult policy balance. I'm not saying it's easy and we may not be able to find that, but I'd like to see if there's a way for us to include that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to I just wanted to kind of acknowledge the maps are really useful and helpful. You know, we get asked or I get asked at least a lot why are we creating development in places that are very likely to be some of the first places submerged in the problem are not the problem.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the fact of the matter is, is that on the other side of those developments that are typically houses that are not currently protected are also going to be submerged. And if we develop correctly and provide the mitigations necessary, we are actually not just mitigating for new development, but we're using that new development to incentivize and finance'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the protections for those existing residents in a way that the city would have to pay for if we aren't doing that. And I think the maps really help with that comment. I, I had a different take on the housing actions section.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I appreciate that it says we should consider things. I don't think it says we should just ignore the charter, etc.. I'd like to see a policy though. I think it does a great job of talking about the importance of land use and housing as it relates to climate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would like to see us add a policy that says that, you know, we should adopt a new general plan amendment as it relates to land use and zoning obviously will go through our planning board, etc.. Two other quick places I there are a number of places in which there is talk about rezoning property or creating tidelands'",
        "'speaker_6': 'neighborhoods, etc., where we are literally starting to talk about very small sections of the island whereby people who own and live in that housing may be asked to either give it up or change the nature of the housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to be careful that we don't get too far where we start impacting the property values of the land that is owned by those people without having really engaged them in a conversation about what it's going to take to protect that value and also give them an opportunity to participate in the discussion because it's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'real and that devaluing is going to come if we don't do something. But I just want to be you know, I think the plan walks carefully, but I think that now that it's starting to put these things in actions, we need to start engaging those people really, really soon about kind of what does this all mean as'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we start moving forward in time? I'm out of time, so I'll stop there. But I'm happy to support this if somebody makes that motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But we have another councilmember and another councilmember in the mayor to briefly speak. I mean, I'm going to speak before you may speak as long as you want it, Councilmember Bella.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you again, everyone who worked on this. I think that this was a tremendous undertaking and it shows that when we work together we get great work product. So a few comments in addition to the note about updating our fleet and electrifying it, I would also like some sort of notation or look at fleet reduction where'",
        "'speaker_11': 'possible. I think that it's not enough just to electrify, but I think we also need to really revisit how much of our fleet is necessary. And that's something that I think would be a cost savings, but also potentially a benefit, obviously, to the environment with regards to the traffic signals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Translation, if we could indicate I'm assuming that these and I think we've we've spoken about this these are Alameda traffic signals. But if if there's a possibility of also and I know we have continued to talk to Oakland about their signals but that that also be a part of this and that we note that there because I'",
        "'speaker_11': 'think it's important we have to work with them too. And there's significant issues with some of their signals. First and last mile modes of transit. I know we're still unfortunately lime bike is now just lime scooter. That said, I think having those connectors where AC transit and the ferry to connect those to where we have gaps and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to give an update on that and to note that in here, I think that's important. I don't know what we're doing. I know we have staff working on it, but I think including that in this is would be helpful in terms of where we're at.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then if I could just suggest that we add an appendix and that would be and to update this, this is a living document as much as it is a kind of it's a starting point, really. But to add an appendix every year when we do our budgets and when we revisit the mid-year budget cycle to include'",
        "'speaker_11': 'our expenditures to date towards this plan, and I know that we've been noting it, but I think adding it to this actual document will help keep us accountable as well as give us an accounting and the community and accounting in terms of seeing what portions of this plan we've moved on, where we made those expenditures, what funds'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we got them from. And I think that that's just a helpful kind of year to year feedback that we can be looking at both staff and council as well as the public. But I'm ready to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I know that, you know, there's there's different provisions in there that that might read differently. I think our intent, at least, has really been to move forward on this and to streamline different policies and procedures within the city so that we can actually be effective at achieving these goals.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So thank you very much. And I'm ready to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, I don't want to stand in the way, but very briefly, again, thank you to all the participants. And I was thinking back in the early days of CASA. It's hard to believe now, but in the Alameda Unified School District, our schools didn't even have recycling bins and receptacles where the students and faculty and staff could'",
        "'speaker_0': 'sort their their trash and and cancer came in. I think the city helped and communicated with the school district. And now the kids are some of our strongest advocates. I don't think you have to look very far back in time to see that climate change is real.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, if you've been following the news out of Louisiana and New Orleans and some of the other cities in the last week, that they're both undergoing heavy rains and some flooding and just unusual amounts of rain that have are saturating the the groundwater, the water table.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was just a report that came out today that Northern California by mid-century and we're almost at 2020, but my mid-century, our climates will be our temperatures will be sometimes ten degrees higher for months at a time because of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so climate is changing and we have to change to and I, I understand Councilmember de your sensitivity about measuring.

        "'speaker_2': 'Um, we included in the report and it still exists today that Taser has military grade server security and that the data is ours. It's not theirs to release. There has not been a breach at Axon or Taser. They were Taser when we got the contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Their axon. Now, they have not had a breach. They have not. There's been no unauthorized releasing of any of our videos. And the only videos that we released now is in response to 14 AB 1421 that passed January 1st or became effective and now 748, which became effective July 1st outside of that or a court order.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The videos aren't being released.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Understood. And how I'm assuming if you could give us a report, I guess, on how the how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're going to get a microphone. It's a little tricky when you're holding a baby. He doesn't speak very loud. We're going to I think we've got a remote microphone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Chief, there was a question about the efficacy of the body cameras and how they're doing in terms of protecting officers as well as members of the public, if you can speak on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I can give you some anecdotal numbers, and I know that the letter that we received from Oakland Privacy specifically asked the question about use of force incidents. That was not a problem that we were trying to combat at the time that we bought the cameras.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, the person who wrote the letter asked specifically if we had seen a, an increase or a reduction in use of force incidents since the cameras were implemented, they've gone up and down, but more or less they've been steady.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The high number was 29 in 2014 or 15 sorry, 2015 this year to date we've had six. And in the intervening years the numbers have bounced around 21, 22, 24. So it hasn't shown any an increase or decrease this year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we're on pace for a decrease, but there's no evidence that it's specifically related to the body cameras.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. Sure. My final question, which is also in the privacy letter, but is there a reason why this was a no bid contractor or why we didn't go out for bid on it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, because we're still in contract with them. We weren't asking for a new contract. We were extending the terms of the original contract to to pay for the data overages because of the the extra videos that we're recording.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also there's some new video redaction software so that we could be compliant with the new state laws. And so we're just trying to extend an existing contract. Thank you. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Of questions, statements. I'm prepared to support this contract moving forward, but I'd like to ask my colleagues to join me in providing some direction to staff as a part of this contract to bring back sometime this fall both what I would call the expanded Sanctuary City Data and Privacy Referral, which I believe is under discussion under the'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But I think it's we've had some kind of partial policy requests out there, and I think that if we're going to continue to move forward and collect more and more data about people who are in our community, I think we need to take the steps early on to ensure that we are in control of that data and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'know what is being done with it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you want to comment on that, Chief Hilary?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Just briefly, I would tell you that the retention schedule that we have in our existing policy right now is based on a couple of things. One, we're being compliant with the new state laws 1421 some 48 and then also the other things that we're dealing with are the Statue of Liberty.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Patience for the criminal offense that's committed. So a homicide, for example, we hold that forever. Other certain felonies might be three years, might be six years. Sexual assault could be longer. It just depends on the crime. So we're not going to destroy the video before the statute of limitations expires on that on that crime.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also in response to court orders, discovery motions and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if I understood the vice mayor correctly, you're also concerned or maybe even more concerned with release policy?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think I think the how we how these videos are released. Obviously in compliance with all state laws and federal laws, as it were. But I think that the council should actually have the power to set the policy on how we're releasing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, and we can certainly consider that as staff direction, although I do think in the policy now, we have criteria for release of the video. Are you are we thinking about public records request the news media or all of the above?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's if I could just interject, that's where Senate bill or Assembly Bill 1421 and 80, 47, 48 apply before before January 1st and July 1st. The videos couldn't be released in APRA. Now, now they have to be for certain, for certain types of offenses or officer misconduct, critical incidents, use of force, shooting, etc..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that but outside of that, we don't release them on, on prior requests.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if I understand correctly, you wanted to make sure that our policy is in compliance with state law.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And considered by the policymaking body of the city and in scope.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Manager Levitt so we can we could bring back what the current policy is and have a discussion consistent with and then also have the expanded discussion on data privacy in general.

        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Just two points. I think for me personally, I think the path of least resistance when it comes to dealing with the item before us is to move the staff's recommendation. Because I'm weary, at least of the second point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm weary of kind of interjecting certain issues that I still have to, you know, be brought up to speed on. So how it intersects, I suspect that Vice Mayor Knox White is not asking us to right now to to endorse a sanctuary city policy whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think I suspect he is probably suggesting that we have a conversation on how a sanctuary policy, sanctuary city policy intersects with things like this. But that still leads me to believe, though, that that should be a discussion separate from tonight, in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor. That's right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Just just to clarify, the city already has a sanctuary city policy, and we're not talking about that. There was a referral about a year and a half, maybe two years ago from other council members up here to look at how we are using data and how that fits with our sanctuary city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My request is that we actually bring that referral that has been sitting around for two years back, expand it to actually just look at privacy data in general and then fold this conversation into that conversation so that as we are continuing to provide longer and bigger contracts for collecting more and more data, we actually know that we're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'doing so with a kind of a comprehensive approach to protecting our citizens and cities data. And privacy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And and I will just add with regard to the comments that were made by the gentleman from Oakland privacy, I remember sitting in on the hearings. I'm including with representatives of the ACLU, the American Civil Liberties Union.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And they had done a white paper. And I read the whole thing. And one of the conclusions the ACLU came to was I remember them saying they surprised themselves in their support for body worn cameras, and they saw them as both protecting the public and protecting the police.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And but certainly, you know, any equipment is only as good as the policy that governs it. And I'm sure that it would be instructive to take a look at at what our policy is and with any necessary updates.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm hearing, I think, a motion and direction to staff. Is that is that fair assessment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I'll make that motion with the direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you move approval and then with the direction is stated. Okay. So a motion to have a second go.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, it is. Basically it's saying that we need to make sure that we have a policy for how we are addressing the data that is collected by these cameras and that we should just wrap that into the conversation that is already planning to come back later this fall.'",

On a staff between the city manager and I, we will work on getting as much information back as is reasonably consistent with the direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, well stated by a lawyer. Okay. But I think we have enough information on what of that policy relates to the body worn cameras. It will come back when we look at the body worn camera policy. Okay. And it almost sounds like two items, but I leave it in the capable hands.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're capable hands. Okay. Any further questions? Okay. We just get a second, right? No, we did it. We have a motion. Do we have a second? With a motion and a second discussion. All in favor, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hope.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion was as previously stated, we are moving this item with the staff direction. That was just. And the the in the motion is the one that the city clerk read about the body worn camera contract. Okay. Motion second.'",

No, no data supporting that. Several weeks ago, I pointed out data showing how year in, year out, the typical Alameda renter pays an affordable rent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's not to say that that there are hardships in Alameda, but the typical Alameda renter, based upon year in, year out census data, pays an affordable rent. Now in terms of policy, what that suggests is not an overarching undoing of the rental market that we are doing on the cusp of doing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What that what the data suggests is an incremental approach that's mediation based like we had in the previous the original 3148 ordinance. The data supports that. The data does not support the overarching things that we're doing this evening.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Out. In Berkley, you saw a significant reduction in the African-American population in South Berkeley from 1980 to 1990. Because Berkeley's popular rent control was adopted in 1980. And so you can analyze the two data points. So I appreciate the fact that the young Americans of Filipino descent came out to speak passionately, not just for rent control, but'",

For the working poor. So that's my concern. And I just also want to end by saying that the type of rent control that we're adopting, in my opinion'",

And M-1 was an effort to impose the hard caps just cause type of rent control that you're seeing today. And at that same election, the Alameda INS had supported L1, which was the mediation based rent control, because I think Alameda INS clearly understood then and they'",
        "'speaker_5': 'understood now that there is no place for a heavy handed city hall to come down and begin controlling, taking over a part of our local economy, a part of our civic society. And that's what you're doing. By adopting the rent control that you're going to do tonight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On a final note, I want to say how disappointed I am in adopting this rent control with the absence of data supporting it as to why it should be adopted. Which leads me to believe that this isn't. This is all about just politics.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But this kind of politics, there's going to be some real people who suffer. And the very people who will be young Americans who are passionate about it. Come back to me and come back to city hall in 11 years or 12 years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I guarantee you, alameda, this is not going to not gentrify alameda. The record of rent control. Is it gentrified? The places were hard capped. Rent control are adopted. Think about the movie that's being played right now in San Fran about San Francisco, the last African-American in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a movie right now. So think about that and think long and hard as to whether or not you benefit from this, because I do think that there was and is a viable opportunity in the mediation based rent control that had its deficiencies, no doubt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that but those deficiencies which could have been ameliorated. So. I think this is a sad day because I see this as incredible government overreach and heavy handedly coming down on a part of our community.'",

A lot of things have changed over the years. And back when we were in grad school in the 1980s, we that was before a law called Costa Hawkins went into effect, and that was in 1995'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And that's why rent control does not apply to any multifamily units or single family that were built after 1995. That was the compromise that the legislators in Sacramento made between the advocates who were saying some of the same things that we heard tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you impose rent control, then people are just going to start building multi-family units. And, you know, I am aware because I'm on the policy committee of the CASA, the Legislative Policy Committee for the CASA Compact, that there is some talk in Sacramento about modifying Costa Hawkins or it may go back to the voters, but right now'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it's right where it was in 1995. So between the 1980s and 1995, I would say that legislators did recognize some of those problems and that solution was adopted. And then since you mentioned the movie The Last Black Man in San Francisco, it's a fine, independent movie.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You should go see it. I do not believe that it supports opposing this measure. In fact, they have not. Okay. Remember my no applause rule, but I'm for a fine local insight if you're like me and you stay to watch the credits.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'I think that there's a difference. Well, when we look at data between causation and correlation, and I think that a lot is made tying certain things that might happen simultaneously and saying that one is the cause of the other.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'm I would like to be wary of doing that, especially on this issue. But I also think that there has been a lot of studies that have been done recently. One of them was by the Haas Institute for Fair for a Fair and Inclusive Society in Berkeley, out of UC Berkeley.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the report, the policy brief was done in 2018 and it's called Opening the Door for Rent Control towards a comprehensive approach to protecting California's renters. And a lot of the things that they look at are kind of the reason that the council is going about enacting these changes to this existing ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, among the things that they. Talk about our the inequitable impact of our housing crisis and how it housing affordability and and access to housing disproportionately affects seniors, low income families, people with disabilities and communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They also note that one part of our housing crisis relative to renters and what's continuing to set rent set renters back are that there are continuing to be rising rents, but there are stagnating wages. And so, you know, I think that that's important when we look at the CPI.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Some people are saying, well, we look at the CPI. Will a lot of employers make decisions about wage increases based off of the CPI and CPI? Q And so while not everyone is getting those increases, it is a point that that a lot of employers and employee groups, frankly, look at when when asking for different wage increases'",
        "'speaker_11': 'or setting different wage increases. And so I think part of what we're trying to do is be cognizant of how much of that increase is going towards one thing, whether it goes towards rental housing alone or to a number of other things that are increasing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other thing that this study looks at is beyond the monetary impacts, but the human cost of housing instability and displacement. And that's something that, you know, when we supported the Everyone Home Plan, we were looking at and and the folks that did the research and wrote this are housing research analysts for the California Community Partnerships Program'",

        "'speaker_11': ', Policy Link, among others, and the Program for Environmental and Regional Equity at USC. We were just talking about our Climate Action Plan, and this also goes to that. This is an ordinance. Part of what we're trying to do is update it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It can be updated later if things change. And one thing that I posit is there have been times that the CPI has been negative, meaning that. People. We've laid people off. People have actually, you know, it's actually dropped.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And, you know, as we look forward, we still have a base, a minimum in this range. And so even if the CPI were to drop or to go to zero, there can be rent increases in those years. And so I think that that's something to also keep in mind.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Just quickly, I can respect that council member De Zug has his own philosophy and opinion. Yeah, I think for every data point that he that he raises, there's another way to look at it. In Alameda, half the renters are paying more than 30% of their income.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is considered unaffordable. This ordinance is written to try to help those people. Councilmember De talks about his time in the late seventies and early eighties at UC Berkeley and the studies that he did. Many of the studies that were done in Berkeley on rent control at that time have been debunked in the in the school of'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I would like you know, I think it's really important if we're going to have this conversation to talk about the whole picture and to really talk about how this is a peace. And my hope is that at some point 20 years from now, when the Bay Area has hopefully recovered from this housing crisis, we can have a'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So we're better than any other place and there's no other place I'd rather live than right here. And I think a lot of people are that way. And on the back of the room there, we have that sign.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Everyone belongs here. So I think we need to make policy decisions based on that value and based on that priority. And it's been a long five years. You know, this is about the time five years ago, I decided to run for council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this was not an item that, you know, people were talking about. But yet I think it's the one thing that we spent the most time on in our council over the last five years. And I think it's pitted our community against each other.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's sad to me to see how that happened. And I hope that now, you know, we have the just cause, you know, that was in so and it's past the referendum period. So I don't know why that's being discussed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have this measure which hopefully will pass tonight. We have modifications to, you know, for some of the things that people in the audience had asked for, like the earthquake relocation, you know, we're going to have modifications come back.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mark Potter is going to bring those back in the fall. And I'm sorry that people think that we punish, but I think what we've done is protect. There was a tremendous amount of people at risk of being displaced, and we saw that happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think I called it social cleansing because that's what it is. And John talked about it a little bit. And Malia talk about, I'm sorry if using your first name is a bit of an emotional issue. So they talk about it a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, the pressure we have on the lower wage earners in our society and our city and our area is just tremendous. And we felt as a body that we had to do something to protect people. People were not able to afford the double digit rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And yet we put in our our controls. And the data I saw in in the Chronicle of that over the past year, Alameda is average 6.2% increase. So that's above five that's surely above CPI. So there's data here that shows even though we've we've tried to help, you know, it hasn't really filter down to benefit the most'",
        "'speaker_9': 'vulnerable. And I think that society is judged on how we take care of our most vulnerable, whether it's our children, whether it's our elders, whether it's, you know, those that that are just struggling to make ends meet. And I think that was our responsibility as a council, and that's what we did.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, if we have people working, we also increase the minimum wage, which I think also helped. But if we have people working for ten or $11 an hour and they can't afford to live here, they're going to live out in Modesto and Antioch and Pittsburgh, and they're either going to drive contributing to greenhouse gas and global'",
        "'speaker_9': 'warming, you know, or they're just not going to work here anymore. And then how does that impact our businesses? So everything is all connected in my mind. And if we really want to stand by those two signs that are back there and the things that we are, you know, have happy, smiling photo opportunities on three or four'",
        "'speaker_9': 'times a year, then I think we have to vote those values. And that's what I plan on doing today. This has been I hope that now that our staff and our council is wrapping this up, we can have a time of healing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that because we have protections, I think our tenants are not going to be afraid to speak up when they need a maintenance problem. They're not going to be afraid to speak up when they have an issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because the fear of. Addictions is gone. You know, we're not going to have a summer house, 22, 23 anymore. That's never going to happen again in Alameda. We're not going to have a470 central ever again happen in alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know those two things, we can sit here and say how sad it was, but if we just say how bad it was and we couldn't do anything and then do anything about it, then we have neglected our duty to you and we have neglected our duty to protect every resident of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, I mean, I do hear the concern and the fears of the small property owners. I do hear the concerns and the fears of the owner occupied. And, you know, I'm willing to sit down and talk to anybody any time if they have ideas.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, when Assemblymember Bonta ran for council, he said, I'll listen to any idea, doesn't have to come from me. But if it's a good idea, I'm going to listen to it. And I've tried to follow that advice and that guidance.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you have an idea that you think can help, by all means, talk to me. I'm open. I'll meet you for coffee. I love every single coffee shop in Alameda, and the more I can drink of it, the happier I am.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think there's things we can do to improve the city. You know, it's it's something we put in there to help when there are huge maintenance issues, like a large roof or, you know, foundation things like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we also have to do it in a fair way. So we put that in and it's only been used once, and I think that application got kicked. So please bring me your ideas. I want to sit and listen to everybody and make sure that we protect everybody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And when I sit here and I say everyone belongs here, you can be damn sure that I mean it. And I stand for it. And that's a value I believe in. And I'm going to fight for it as long as I'm sitting up here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. So we've heard from all the council members and I think I heard motion.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'Ultimately, each elected official will have to make their own decision on whether or not there is a conflict that's presented that would counsel for recusal. And when an elected official makes that decision, they announce that from the dais and they leave the room.'",

        "'speaker_0': '18 So when we have more than six public speakers, you each get 2 minutes.

        "'speaker_0': 'will, just scoot out to the aisle so you can get up to the the podium and you will have our undivided attention. And I would just request the audience and you've been a great audience, and I just continue to be respectful as you are.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Have one question. Of course. We've received a number of social media has been rife with comments. We've received a number of letters from people asking us tonight to take action to remove our colleagues. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how it is an elected official sitting on a city council in Alameda can'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be elected or removed from office.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Be happy to you generally. And in this case, there are essentially three methods that an elected official, for example, a council member, may be removed from office. One of them is through the district attorney's grand jury process, which is what we're here to discuss today, though, it's important to know that the grand jury did not return an'",
        "'speaker_12': 'accusation. And so that process is not before the council and it's not before the public. The second possibility and these are all just theoretical possibilities of if there is a elected official convicted of a felony under the state law and an elected official once convicted of such a crime will be automatically removed.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And thirdly, it's through the electoral process, either through a recall petition or at the ballot box at the regular election cycle. The Alameda City Charter does not provide for, nor does the general law provide for the opportunity for a city council to remove one of its members.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that particular action is not available to the council and certainly not before the council tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I ask just a clarifying you use the term accusation that the general that the grand jury did not return an accusation. Can you just talk about the.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Of that? Absolutely. So that is a legal term under state law. If a grand jury believes that a a crime that was committed and committed and it was serious enough and there were sufficient votes. The grand jury could forward what's essentially a legal document, which is called an accusation to the district attorney, requesting that the district attorney'",
        "'speaker_12': 'charged a public official with removal. And that did not occur in this case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'll follow up with to that. But the grand jury did comment on that, I believe, on the electoral process in talking about its decision not to make the accusation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Certainly the grand I mean, the report provides that the electoral the grand jury essentially deferred to the electoral process to make that decision, which is either at the ballot box or through a recall process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's just just the one last thing. So in this case, no crime where violating violating the charter is not a crime. So there's no felony charge or anything that the district attorney could prosecute. So the only way the district attorney would get involved in removing would be to prosecute a grand jury accusation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the process would be that the grand jury would be asked to look at that. They would make a finding. And then if they determined during that. Is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A question?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to. Yeah. That they would return an accusation that it would be prosecuted. And at that point in time, the removal would happen. Right. That so I want to just make sure I understand the process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I don't want to comment on whether or not a crime is or isn't present because that that's it's difficult for me to comment on what the district attorney may or may not determine whether or not a crime is present.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's certainly not before the council tonight and not before this and not what this action is. The the report itself speaks for itself.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And is the end of that process the end the end of the civil grand jury process.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Essentially, with this council having to take an action tonight to provide responses?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is an important distinction. This was a report by the civil grand jury.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay. Any further clarification questions? Okay. So with that, we're going to get started on public comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Russ Chia, Teeny, Laura Thomas and Tony Graham.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor Ashcraft, members of the city council. Tonight should be a night of celebration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is. Mike.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I'm sorry. Tonight should be a night of celebration. I say that because finally, an independent body, a cross-section of the community in Alameda County, had a chance to review the misconduct charges against Councilperson Vela A.D. in their investigation, unlike the city investigation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They got to hear all the evidence. They got to hear the tape recording, which is the best evidence in this case. Not surprisingly, the grand jury examined all the evidence, and they found that Councilman Vela and O.D. improperly tried to influence the selection of the new fire chief in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Maybe more shockingly, they concluded that the accused council persons were allowed to participate in the editing of the City Run Investigation Report. I got to tell you, I was a prosecutor for 40 years. We never invited the accused in to alter the police reports.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's that's the most primitive notion of conflict of interest, how they could participate in something that is examining their own conduct. But nevertheless, they did. So sadly, tonight, we're not celebrating. The handling of this matter by Syd. The city has been shameful at best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It erodes any confidence the taxpayer should have and elected to city officials. We've already paid out $1,000,000 for the mist, mis deeds of these two council persons. And now you're going to be making decisions on whether or not we pay $200,000 for their attorney fees.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All the while, the public's been kept in the dark. Public media has made requests for a copy of the tape, and the city has stonewalled too many major media outlets. So I would implore you to release the tape and not to vote to pay the attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Give estrogen tenure. Your next speaker is Thomas Graham. No, it's not Q&A. No. Later, you can ask of the city attorney if you had a question. But no, it was not Q&A. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. And council members present. I'm Laura Thomas with the Renewed Hope Housing Advocates. And tonight I'm speaking on behalf of Alameda, renters, seniors, labor and all who support our strong progressive council. I want to thank the grand jury for its work and the city for taking steps to resolve an issue that's become a distraction'",
        "'speaker_3': '. While many of us don't agree with all aspects of the findings or how the fire chief selection process was characterized, we should all be able to agree on the following. First, the Chief Rodriguez has been doing a great job leading the department and building trust with his firefighters and the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We thank the chief and the firefighters for responding so quickly to the Woodstock fire this weekend. Second, we can agree that with the new city leadership, new city manager, mayor and council members who have championed our 9911 our emergency medical or affordable housing and homeless services, that our city is positioned to address the challenges that remain.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our island is characterized now by a strong quality of life diversity and a welcoming spirit. Yet our immigrants are under attack like never before, and future generations of Alabamians may never be able to afford to live here. Traffic congestion threatens our quality of life, and we need real transit solutions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And finally, sea level rise will affect our unique island environment. We ask that you answer our call to move forward as a team to address these issues. We need the strong leadership that each one of you provides. And we have a coalition here tonight that is calling for this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All these everybody here. It is in that spirit, that vocal unable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ask you to sit down so you don't block the view of people behind you. But thank you. Your attendance is noted.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Queue up, if you would. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I want to express my appreciation to council members Jim Audy, Amelia Vella for their service to the Alamogordo community. During all of the council meetings I have attended or listened to over the course of several years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They have always been well-prepared to discuss the issues at hand. They consider input from their constituency. They have thoughtful questions and they give the reasons for their decisions. I believe that they have always acted in good faith. I do not intend to imply that other council members did not do this also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I want to single out members Odion Vella tonight because I believe they are under attack by political opponents. I want them to know that there are a lot of people in Alameda who support them. We are the people who elected them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that the Council will make changes to the city charter and enact new procedures that will make it very clear to council members now and in the future what they can and cannot do to represent their constituents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please decide when a letter of recommendation is in various interference and when it is, a council member is right to advocate for a constituent so that the door is not left open for politicizing council members actions and city procedures at great expense to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Duncan and Elizabeth Green, then Bernie Mathews. Okay. Mr.. Hello. You all know me. I'm Barney Duncan, and I came here for Jim and Leah. As far as I'm concerned, I'm a tenant. I know nothing about the law.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'The council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the staff members have to learn how to run the staff. That's what I got out of the whole thing. Okay. Maria Melia and Jim have helped the tenants out more than anyone else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They fought for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They backed us up. And as far as I'm concerned, if you get rid of them, you're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Getting rid of the two people that are really good on this council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We finally got a.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And you, John Whyte, care about the tenants. I, you know, I don't know the new city attorney or the city manager and the city clerk all I don't know. But I do know these people. I have spoke with them.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'That you expect to come out of my mouth. It doesn't come out of my mouth.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Person that wants to keep people in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That back doors up. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Green.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello again. I've reviewed the grand jury's report and the city's draft response to the grand jury. I strongly encourage the city to revise its response letter to completely accept the grand jury's findings and recommendations without qualifications. I find many of the city's draft responses to be filled with wiggle words such as staff and council worked together to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'consider options for additional training or consider strengthening the charter. That's not good enough. All the option to responses have to go. The Grand Juries report makes it clear that both council members one and two, behaved unethically in their coercion of this former city manager.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city must take concrete actions now, including revising the city charter to prevent conflicts of interest and council interference with the city manager. The city must implement a code of conduct and mandate regular ethics training for council members and senior staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, let's take a step back and look back. Look at this event in a maybe simpler, less legalistic way. I think what we really have here is a case of two council members who attempted to bully the former city manager, have not admitted their errors and now seek to be rewarded for their bad behavior by requesting reimbursement'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for their legal expenses. Perhaps they may even pursue legal action against the city in order to be reimbursed. How can this possibly be okay? How can we explain to our children that our city government is so corrupt that it allows bullies to call the shots?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I've stated in the past I am extremely concerned about the demonstrated lack of leadership, ethical behavior, failures to following the rules and regulations, the law, and owning up to mistakes by the City Council. Specifically, two of its members whose lack of ethical behavior, which has been documented in the recent Alameda County Grand Jury Report regarding the debacle'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The proposition that the offending members did not know that this was a violation of the law but also was a violation of common sense and honor, is truly unbelievable to believe that Mrs. Vella, an attorney as well as an adjunct professor at Mills College, teaching ethics and Mr. O.D., a state director for California Assembly member, did not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know that this was a violation is simply laughable. Also, sadly, when all totals are going to cost the taxpayers over $1,000,000, of course, mingled in all this intrigue is a five ton elephant in the room, the Alameda Firefighters Union, which has a strong hold and influence on this council in this case, certainly Mr. O.D. and as well'",

        "'speaker_4': 'The grand jury process doesn't give the council members really any point to clarify any of their actions. It's not that process. All they do is they provide oversight. They make recommendations. They can start formal accusations, but they're not that kind of body to claim and give them an opportunity to make their case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'People like to use it as a statement of fact of what actually occurred. And I don't believe that they acted unethically myself. I think that my actions and are watching them. They are honorable people. And so given all that specifically on this this thing, I would ask you on finding 19 four, you respond with option two in'",

Council members Villa and Odie violated the city charter and interfered with the city manager's duties. These two have damaged the city and the people of Alameda to the tune of $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These two have damaged the integrity of this city government, and now they have insulted the people of Alameda by asking us to pay for their attorney's fees to cover the cost of their unlawful conduct. They say there should be some more training for these two malarkey.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'It's not, but it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Your time is starting.'",
        "'speaker_10': '17, 17. A 17 year old girl stood up here and was crying today. She was crying because she's looking for protection. She was talking to the leader. She was looking for help. And yet she's talking to two people up here who a grand jury found were fighting to hire somebody who's less than the best to give her'",
        "'speaker_10': 'protection. A less than qualified chief of the fire department than what was otherwise available. That's what they were fighting for. And that's what these are. It's just frustrating. So the bottom line is this. The council has already approved a million bucks to help to try to clean up the problem.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There's an implication of people screwed up in that to go ahead and say you screwed up and you're also going to get reimbursed the 200 bucks, the $200,000. That's just talk about setting a bad precedent. You three need to have a deep talk with each of yourselves because their behavior is reflecting on you right now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'What your reactions are to this and coming out and talking about whether or not you endorse the behavior that took place or not. That's going to be what I'm really going to be waiting for and listening to, not as a complete counsel.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'll be listening to that, but as the individuals on the council as well. Removal for malfeasance. Just create the process for doing that and get rid of them. You have the powers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To bring in. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is Johansen and have Todd then Trish Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I first want to applaud Councilman Desai and Councilman White for already starting this process by holding public hearings on how to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Revise and update the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was fortunate to attend one of those meetings and I think that's a great step in the right direction. Basically, what this is an issue along with some of the other issues that has divided our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It it's preventing us from moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our two council members have worked Derrick.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have been dedicated to Alameda and to the people of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this issue has just kind of been holding us back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm hoping that we can get beyond it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That we can make recommendations, that we can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that we can have training and that we can revise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The charter so that it's more specific how to regulate this and that we continue with the team that we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because I think we're moving forward in Alameda and we need to concentrate on much more the climate action and a lot of trafficking and rent and families and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of other issues. So I'm hoping that we all can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In a positive way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Todd. Mr. TEICH.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, everybody. This is very distressing. The poor are holding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Closer to the microphone, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Better?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just briefly. Before coming here, I reread the Declaration of Independence, the full marvel that enumerated all the aggressions or. Or failings of the despot in England. I'm reading it, and all along it is. It's detailing what's happening today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not only here in Alameda, but across the country. There's an organization called Equal Justice. They take on all cases to just resolution. I sat on a grand jury a couple of years ago in Lake County. Now, I can't go back there unless I'm armed and involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Crystal meth. This disturbing grand jury report is scathing. There's no there's just no glossing over it. Something must be done. Somebody needs to become contrite instead of demanding a payment for attorney services that they created. Nobody's going to pay for my defender, my public defender.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They stand up there and don't do a thing. I still get guilty. Equal justice. Whether it's for an officer, city councilman, a street person. A. Victim of mortgage and securities violations. These are all real. They take place every day in our society and nobody cares who holds the deed on this property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which bank is it sitting? It would deed. What bank is holding the deed on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Todd. Ernie Martin here is thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Trish Spencer, Barbara Cohn and Rosalind Fortuna.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Ms.. Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. Thank you. The charter language is very clear. Article two, section two, dash to a council. Appoint city manager. Article seven, Section seven, dash two. City manager shall have the power and it shall be his or her duty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See to appoint employees of the city under his or her jurisdiction. That includes the fire chief. Section seven, Dash three. Neither council nor any member shall interfere with the execution by the city manager of their duties and an attempt by a City Council member to influence the City Manager in the making of any appointment shall subject such'",
        "'speaker_1': 'City and City Council member to removal from office for malfeasance. So I think that's actually very clear. I think the grand jury did get it wrong. I know in regards to the vote for the multimillion dollar settlement, it was 3 to 2 with member Vela and myself voting no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that has to be corrected. I think that's significant because Member Ody did vote as part of the three to support it. For clarification, I was not interviewed by the grand jury finding 19 dash one failure to provide council members with adequate training.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's sufficient training, and I don't think there's any problem with the training. And as was stated before, you have to the both councilmembers are attorneys. So I would say option two on that partially disagree. Friday night 19 Dash two Charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fails to provide enforcement mechanisms. Again, I think the charter is very clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Subject to removal. So for that, I would say option to 19 Dash three participation and editing. I again would say option two. I we asked the city attorney at the time they were told they could participate. But at the end of the day, I think the report was independent.'",
        "'speaker_1': '19 Dash four Was there interference? I would partially disagree because the question is an attempt to influence. That's what our charter provides.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you for being here. Next speaker is Ms.. Cohen. I believe Ms.. Cohen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't really need a mike because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually you do. But I do. People I'm listening to television won't hear you unless you're in talking to Mike.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm just going to be short and sweet. My name is Barbara Cohn. I'm a resident of Alameda, been living here for the last 40 years. I second most of what the people have said before me in terms of the behavior of these two council people, I would think presumed on how intelligent and well prepared they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They would have known better than to violate the city charter. So my question to you is, when is this going to be resolved? Is it going to be behind closed door? And we're going to read about it in the Sun or the journal, and we'll find out that the city council has paid for their legal fees, which'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I find very questionable. And is there going to be a future meeting on this so that we know what's going on? Is this going to be done behind a closed door? And my other recommendation is, I think the three minute rule for all speakers is good.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it should also be applied to the members of the city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Okay. And just for clarification, because that was addressed. We actually do have a time limit. We have 9 minutes per item and we have our clocks in front of us as well. But since we're making the policy and not just commenting on an item, that was something that was determined.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do find that our speakers are quite able to enunciate their views in two or 3 minutes. And our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is Rosa, Linda Fortuna. Then Doug Briggs, then Doyle Saylor. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You heard the clerk. So be ready and we'll keep this moving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, I'm Rosa, Linda Fortuna. I want to thank council members Vella and Odie for their decision to recuse themselves because of their conflict of interest. The public needs to be allowed to review the unredacted independent investigation report, which is originally 70 pages along with the city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The City Council Members Redacted report, which the Council edited and reduced this outsiders report from 70 pages to 13 pages. The grand jury concluded that the council's editing of the report from 70 pages to only 13 pages, damaged the independence of the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The grand jury also concluded that the council members should not have participated in the acceptance and editing of this report. They should not have been allowed to participate, period, because of their personal interest that conflicted with their official capacities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mayor Ashcroft's recommendation, heard in her letter to Judge Carvill for city council workshops, does not resolve the problem that we have. Both council members, Belen OED are licensed California attorneys. They both had to pass the ethics tests for the state bar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any lawyer can read City Charter Section seven, Dash three, and know that any attempt by a council member to influence the city manager in the making of any important man shall subject such council member to removal. Any lawyer should be competent to read and understand the law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilman Bruce Belen already knew exactly what they were doing. I would like Alameda who are watching this council meeting on TV to remember when elections come next year in 2020 when voting for two open seat city council members between.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe Mr. Biggs is there next. Thank you for your comments, Mr. Biggs. And Mr. Biggs is followed by Mr. Saylor. Do I hear? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Doug Biggs. I'm a resident of Alameda. I want to appreciate the comments that Vice Mayor John actually began at this meeting. Your job is not tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that just 1/2 and hold this time, please? I'm gonna ask that anyone who wants to make conversation in the audience do so in the hall so we can concentrate on the speaker. So can I get anyone who wants to make conversation to take that outside to the hall?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. This is the speaker's time. Please present Mr. Biggs, clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I appreciate the comment that was made in the clarification that your job tonight isn't to seek removal and you have no grounds to seek removal of any council member. And also, you're not here to talk about legal fees, although I do want to comment about that in a minute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think what the fact that most of the people up here calling for the heads of the council members have not really read the grand jury report. They're using it for their own purpose of stifling. First Amendment rights in the hope that these people will not speak out for the poorest, for the most needy in the future'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And that is a dangerous path to take. When you read the grand jury report carefully and there are flaws and those need do need to be acknowledged and called out to them at the bottom of it. What they're saying really is that the charter has to be updated.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's ambiguity in the charter, and there's there's there's lack of of accountability in the charter. That's what needs to be dealt with. And we also need to work on the charter to make sure that council members that need to express their First Amendment rights are allowed to do that in an appropriate way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just one thing regarding the legal fees, as others have said, that requiring council members to pay their own legal fees is going to chill the opportunity for people who can't afford to be volunteer council members to sign up for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think you need to be very careful going down that route. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Saylor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then Robin TARULLO.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Doyle Saylor. Thank you for a moment to talk to mayor and city council members. I just want to say that I fully support Jim Odie and Melissa Bella. I will fight for them. And I think this is a politically motivated attack coming tonight and therefore I will be one to stand behind them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Aiello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you. I'm here to support both Councilmember Jim Cody and Malia Vella. I believe, just as Mr. BOLLING mentioned, that the grand jury report is very flawed, as most of the grand jury reports are. But that's another story.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just wanted to mention that they should be supported as they are a dedicated hard work, hard working council members that well represent their constituents as they were well voted into office. And we should remember all that as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if anything should be attended to them, it should be done at the ballot box and not any other way. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And our next speaker is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Catherine Behar with our tour, Rodriguez and Rock Herman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, you're up. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. My name's Catherine. Mr. Santini and Mr. Matthew statements are absolutely correct. However, we asked for it before, but I find it curious that Ms.. Jill Climatique agrees to release the tape. Why won't Mr. Jim Oti and Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Melia Vella is it to telling the independent counsel never even heard the tape, but for $1 million? I believe we're entitled to hear it. I, for one, would love to have a listen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. The next speaker is Arturo Rodriguez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello. Amateur RODRIGUEZ And I've had the opportunity to travel throughout the state and live in many different cities. And let me tell you that Alameda has one of, if not the best fire departments I've ever seen. I've seen them involved in the community like you wouldn't believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the professionalism that they take upon when they respond to their calls is amazing. So I feel disappointed in that they would be used as a pawn for a political attack on our council members that have been serving the city so well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And let me make note that for the record, when when they were asked to stand up to see in the crowd how many supported Jim and Malia, over 90% of the crowd stood up. And just for that, it is clear to me that this is a political attack.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and it's unfortunate that our public servants, the people that we call to rely on when something happens, is being used as a political attack. And it's kind of shameful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Herman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had a mayor. Council members. Well, here we are again talking about the tape and the firing and everything that ensued since then. And the public still hasn't heard that tape. And I think Cathy said you heard it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not even sure that's true. So here we are after all this time and a million bucks down the drain. And the tape is still a secret, and it's a secret from more people than you want to acknowledge at this point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we were previously led to believe it was illegal. In fact, that investigative report that I still hope you haven't paid for said verbatim. I don't want to listen to that tape because I don't want to abet a felony.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now we know now because the D.A. and the grand jury looked at that, that that was false. It was misleading. It was erroneous. So, Mr. City Attorney Russ hit on you for that, and I'm going to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We need to see that tape out there. If there's nothing to hide, if the truth is the truth and the truth is on the tape, then the public needs to know. You've been selective in what's been released. This has already cost $1,000,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of things could be done with that. All of you stood in solidarity. Think of what that could have done for your programs and their all good programs. That's $1,000,000 you're not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Going to get, Mr. Herman, if you don't speak to the speaker, all the people watching on TV won't hear you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So the future involves the claim for legal fees. As I understand from a newspaper story, I didn't get to see the draft report. You seem to be enamored with relying on the investigative report for the conflict between whether one or both committed misconduct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And let's not forget that the investigative report thought that they did that a felony by listening to the tape. That can't be what happens in this case. You cannot rely on it. There would be further laughing stock for this council to produce something like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next is Catherine Pelling and Andrew Huntoon. And then that's our last Larry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Miss Poling, where are you? There. You're. And Mr. Huntoon. There you are. Okay. You're on deck.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank. Hello, Mayor and council. I want to go back to the statements that I made over a year ago when all of this was breaking. A city manager whose job is handling human resources. If somebody is acting in an inappropriate way, you call them on it and you stop it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, this thing of turning this into sort of a witch hunt to overturn our more progressive council who is finally listening to working people and seniors and those of us who need it. And it's being turned into something else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Beyond, I feel like we're just going on and on in circles. It's not about the tape. It's about a really difficult thing that happened. The city manager thought it had to do with her employment, her her review, which turned out to be a delay because of staff workload.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was she was acting out of fear. She felt bullied. All of this, the city settled. That was it. We had an election after this event happened and we spoke very clearly. I'm very proud to have been part of a coalition of labor, of faith, of renters, of homeowners, of small business owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We worked very hard in that election to elect people that would represent our views. And it would be wrong for that one unfortunate incident to suddenly remove the representatives that we elected. We ask that you've been working very strong and very well together and just six months you've accomplished a tremendous amount.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I urge you to continue to stay strong, to work together. The jury, I'm very pleased. The grand jury determined no further accusatory action is needed. I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. Thank you. Mr. Huntoon, you're. Annette was our last speaker. If anyone still has something to say. I hesitate to say this between the speaker slip, Mr. Hinton.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Council members, but fellow citizens. My name's Danny here. And to them, a lifelong Alameda resident. I wanted to point out that the loss of the city goes beyond the monetary $4 million that we seem to be so focused on and that we've lost confidence in our leaders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've lost a legitimate role model that we should be looking to for our council members. You should all be in positions where we can say, I want my children to grow up to act like these people, and this is totally out of line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In addition to the monetary loss, we lost a city administrator that had the integrity and the backbone to stand up. And not only that, but to record this incident so that we could all hear what's been kept from us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These council members, many had their techniques, and we wonder how many times these tactics were not brought in, made public in additionally, this report that this whole meeting is about, that the response to the report appears to have been written by the lawyers that have been paid up to $200,000 to defend these people that don't need defending'",
        "'speaker_2': '. That's my statement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Hinton. And was it our last speaker?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's one more now. There's one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'More speaker. Okay. His Marilyn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is bow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, hello. Thank you. I'm Marilyn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bow. And this afternoon, I printed the grand jury executive summary. I want to read a part of it. Well, it's only two pages, so you can go to 2000 1819 Alameda County Grand Jury Final report. And this is Alameda City Council interference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the middle, it says in the case of Alameda, two members of the city council violated the city charter. They took steps in the behest of a labor organization to push for its candidate by privately meeting with the city manager and pressing the issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They also appeared to use the city manager performance review as leverage in the matter. Remember, this is the grand jury executive report. One councilmember went further by making an indirect threat to the city manager manager's job to a member of the city manager's leadership team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The same council member also wrote a letter using city letterhead, openly advocating for the labor backed candidate. These actions put the city manager in a very awkward position, creating a reasonable belief that her job was on the line if the Labor backed candidate was not selected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a result, she took steps to publicly protest the inappropriate interference in the process. The city manager also sought to peacefully recorded the conversation. She helped the two council members out of fear of additional threats. So 39 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to say after listening to everyone, it's clear they violate the city charter. I hope the city manager's listening. And it says if you do that, you have to be removed. So anyway, I just want to say that I read the grand jury report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're not making it up. It's not a political witch hunt. I don't know why people are saying that. You can read it in black and white from a grand jury. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Poe. And that is our final speaker. Okay. Public comment is now closed. And and I want to thank all of you who came and spoke. As you can see, on the very same set of facts, there is a wide range of of opinion and views.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in just a minute, this counsel, the three of us are going to have a discussion out in public. We are presumably going to have some findings. I want to just give my brief introduction. This regrettable chapter in our city's history came to the attention of the Alameda County Civil Grand Jury, whose legal authority allows it to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'inquire into charges that a public official engaged in willful misconduct while in office. The grand jury undertook an extensive investigation that included testimony from current and former city staff, elected officials and statewide governance experts. The grand jury's report found that the interference of two city council members in the city manager's hiring of a new fire chief violated'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the city charter and ultimately cost the city of Alameda more than $1,000,000. But the cost to the city was not just financial. Public trust in government was diminished, and our city's reputation has been tarnished. The executive summary of the Grand Jury report noted that the Alameda City County Charter is filled with rules and principles to ensure the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'effective and honest administration of government and plainly prohibits the City Council from interfering in the hiring process or trying to influence the city manager, and that this prohibition is common in municipal charters throughout our nation. It is intended to combat cronyism and corrupt government decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We cannot pretend that this series of events didn't happen or wish it away. The only way to bring closure to our city is to address the issue head on. It is imperative that we do so now because this Council has so many important issues to resolve, many of which are on tonight's agenda, including climate change, our aging'",
        "'speaker_0': 'infrastructure, homelessness, renter protections, improving transit, making our streets safer that require the full attention of this body. And I do mean this body of five, but the three of us now, before you have the opportunity and the responsibility with our responses to the grand jury's findings and recommendations to put this episode behind us, I am confident that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our responses will support transparency and good governance and help restore the public's trust in our local government. And I just want to say quickly, my couple of side notes that I took while I was taking notes while all of you spoke, but a couple stood out for me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One of the things to remember is that people are complex and one person is many things. We are talking about a particular episode, a particular point in time. I will second what others have said. This Council. Since we were elected, I became mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been a pleasure to work with all of my colleagues. We have gotten a lot of things done. But again, as I said before, we cannot look away. We cannot pretend that the past didn't happen. We are being watched for our response and I think we can come through on the other side a better council and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to set examples for this body and future bodies. And one of the points that the grand jury made in its report was that in some councils, a strong, capable mayor would have put a stop to to what was going on, but that that was not the case here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a different council now, and I believe that we are going to take this matter into hand and do the right thing. So we are not here to, as we previously said, remove our colleagues. That is not an option before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are not here to. Undo or demean any of the good work they have done. We have all done together to address some very important causes. But we have a grand jury report, findings and recommendations, and we're going to address that now on other council comments before we dig into the meat of the item before us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do. I'm sorry. City council member did you want to comment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, my comment is whether it's. I'm just going to comment. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You. Yeah. And then we'll get into I'm going to just so for the housekeeping details, what I propose to do as we go through the findings one by one and the recommendations one by one and the other little housekeeping detail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I talked to the city attorney earlier today. As I previously noted, we do impose a nine minute time limit on ourselves. I would like a motion out of necessity to just dispense with the time limit. We may not talk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I mean, I've already done half mine, but I just feel that this is an important enough matter for the public to hear our deliberation, that we should be able to go over it. Our nine minute limit. Is that agreeable to my colleagues?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A second. Was that a second? Okay. All in favor. I and so and because normally under our ordinance you would require four votes to approve this. But the city attorney explained to me, do you want to just put your legal explanation on there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Ma'am? Yes, Madam Mayor. So the council has imposed a rule upon itself. It's not an ordinance that each council councilmembers speak for 9 minutes. And given that the recusals at hand, I believe that the rule of necessity would apply.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And and additionally, generally on procedural votes, even a majority of the minority of the Council present might be able to alter rules for process, not substance. All right. This is substance. And I do recommend unanimity in all these matters, given the council rules.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Shinn. Okay. So with that, do you want to make some comments, Councilmember per se.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Let me begin by stating what I think are the principles at stake that the residents need to hear. These are the principles as I see them. The first principle is that no person is above the law and all are equal before the law.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the law of the land is the Alameda City Charter. To me, that's the first principle. Related to the first principle is a second principle that in our democracy here in Alameda takes the form of a professionally run city manager type of government and us having that form.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um. Was not an accident. That there was in 1936, 1937 here in Alameda, a similar, somewhat similar major crises that ultimately resulted in the district attorney and the superior court getting involved to ultimately remove the city manager at that time in 1936, as well as remove the mayor and two other council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe the situation that's facing us is of a similar magnitude and that as council members for the residents here and also for the generations of residents, much in the way some look back at 1936, 1937, that we need to indicate to here and to the future that our local government will still be a professionally run city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'manager form of government. It wasn't by accident that that that we we have that and it wasn't by accident that our city charter was reformed in 1937. So our predecessors fought hard for the type of government that we have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Above all. We are reminded all about our history books, about Tammany Hall cronyism. And that's what that's the principle at stake is whether we're going to have a professionally run city manager form of government. But I also think the biggest principle at stake is that no person is above the law and that we're all equal before the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'law and that the law of the land is the city charter. There are specific details that we are going to respond to after our kind of opening statements. And my hope is that as we move forward on the particular findings and the recommendations that that that we not read more into the grand jury report beyond what is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'already there in plain, simple English. So. That we not quibble over about over facts or the way in which certain matters are characterized or not. The grand jury report and its findings are what they are, and we are being asked to respond to them in black or white, yes or no?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think we deserve. We owe it to future residents of Alameda that we. That we do so. So there will be more things that I want to touch on. But let me just say, there were some items that were discussed this evening which I hope to have a discussion over regarding access to tapes, regarding censure, regarding'",
        "'speaker_5': 'making information available, and. I hope to have a discussion about those as well as what's before us with regard to the grand jury report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember de SAC by summary. Not quite. You want to make any comment?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. I bet I have. Just a couple quick questions I want to ask. Councilmember de SAC reminded me that I wanted to ask about there's been talk about tonight about releasing the tape, that that is not something we could do tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Audience. Audience. You've been stellar up till now. The city attorney is going to answer that question. We will get out of here on the same day we started if you don't do the audience participation thing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mr. SHINN Councilmember That's correct. The agenda item we have not agenda is this as an item to consider that particular action by the Council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then and I'm not sure who to ask this question of, but since it came up a couple of times, it relates to the independent Jenkins report. I think I'm going to look at I never get to call in the city clerk, but is the is the one executive staff who was here at the time that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the grand jury report says that there were problems with allowing the editing. But at the end of the day, a decision by the council was to release the original document, plus the Arata sheet, which was the changes that were proposed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct? And we talked. But to your knowledge, there is no there was no other draft that was presented of the full report of the hundred page report that was edited and never seen redacted to keep names and things out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But correct. That original report is the same first original report the council read.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. This is not a not a fun conversation. Know when I was asked, how do you want to handle this? I said I wasn't here. I don't want I don't want to have to deal with it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's clearly not an option. I come at this from my knowledge. For the most part, it comes from two reports that were written and with a couple of degrees of difference, come to similar conclusions. Both one finds that what?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Both find that when city manager or city councilmember violated the charter and the other one of the other two finds the same, I think any careful reading of the document finds. I can identify that the grand jury report does not say that both members were at the same level in the spectrum of of of influence, etc. They'",
        "'speaker_6': 'specifically call that out. Both documents recommend not moving forward with removal. And as somebody who has to come at this from reading the reports and knowing that people are looking at that I am I tonight am here to accept this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I do agree that there needs to be some acknowledgment that things did not go the way they were supposed to. We would not be sitting here if they had. You know, I'm not going to. It is true that some people are using these reports for political purposes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'At the same time, you know, I am ready tonight to actually just vote, to agree on all four of the findings and more or less accept the recommendations of the grand jury. I personally don't feel that I need a lot of conversation about that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in the end, I do think it's important for our community. We are at the end of the process tonight. This is the this is the. Somebody asked, when does this end? Tonight is the end. There is no unless we don't agree.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we have to come back in September and start the conversation over again, which, trust me, I don't want to do. And my guess is my council member council friends don't want to as well. You know, tonight is the end of the process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We went through the process. We had the opportunity to have the grand jury look at this. They looked at this. They did not recommend for either council member that they be removed. To me, that suggests that there is a spectrum that influence interference happens on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they did not feel that that spectrum was crossed to the extent that that anybody could go to a to the D.A. and be successful and be having a chance of success for removal from office through that process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I you know, I have to accept that. I think we have to be very careful not to accept certain parts of the report and ignore others. Both reports show a city in chaos. Have you read the 100 page Jenkins report?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It shows just absolute chaos across across the organization. The grand jury basically that basically specifically said everybody played a role in this. But we're we we were asked to look at the two council members. And I think we have to own that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, it hurts me. I understand when people sit here and say, we have we the three of us have lost your trust. I understand that. And that is a reasonable thing. On the other hand, the three of us were not a part of that grand jury report.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Tony and I hadn't even been elected. We weren't here when it happened. Two of the other people who were here and it takes three votes to kind of make things happen. So I have questions about why some of this didn't get dealt with before now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But for me tonight, I'm ready to move forward. I would like to see us kind of quickly move forward, put this, you know, accept the findings and put this behind us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor. As much as you know, I also wish we weren't dealing with this. We don't have a way to turn back the clock. But here we are now. And as I often say, we play the hand were dealt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what I propose to do is go through we've all read this report probably several times. The grand jury has made four findings 19 Dash one, two, 19 Dash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Four and four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Closely related recommendations as well. Let's take a look at the first one, which is 19 dash one, finding 19 dash one. If you're in the staff report, it's page two of four. So the city of Alameda is failure to provide council members with adequate training upon first being elected to city council as well as annual training on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'governance helped contribute to an inappropriate interference in the fire chief hiring process. I have trouble agreeing with this finding completely. I think it is a good thing to have training. I know that our council, our city, offers and pays for new council members and in fact, new mayors to attend the League of California Cities boot boot camp'",
        "'speaker_0': ', they call it, for elected officials in Sacramento. Some people avail themselves of that opportunity. Others don't. We do all swear an oath when we're sworn into office to uphold the charter, and presumably one would read and know what it was they were agreeing to uphold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am also mindful of the fact and the vice mayor just noted this, that anything we decide tonight has to be by unanimous vote, because we, a majority of the council, no matter how many are sitting at the dais, is three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In some cases, if we were doing a conveyance of real property, we would need four votes. But so we have to we have to come to agreement. And I don't see the the benefit of coming back in September because I'm not sure what would happen in those intervening weeks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But Councilmember Desai, can I ask you to weigh in on finding 19 dash one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On finding on the findings, will you will find that my approach is, for the most part, the same and three out of four so far for finding number 19 dash one. I believe we should just keep it simple.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As I said from in in my outset, I said, let us not read more into the grand jury report beyond what is already there in plain English. So by keeping it simple, my recommendation is simply to write a letter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In our letter that we transmit that we indicate that the following we agree with the finding that 19 dash one comma, which comma in summary form indicates that. And this and that and the wording that's there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I could just point out it for the finding, for each finding, it is required that the response shall either be agree or disagree wholly with an explanation or disagree partially with an explanation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So agree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So this is one of these areas where I think it's it's probably more important to get this report back to the grand jury with our finding. I think in general, in principle, a new council members should have training, but not all council members are created equal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do believe my two council colleagues we are discussing are very smart, talented attorneys. Their background and experience has been noted. But if what you're saying council member did so, is that for the good of this organization moving forward with this process, do you think we should just agree this is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This finding, in my opinion. While it speaks mostly, I think, to the larger body of council members and while the larger body of council members, myself included, would rather not be implicated in in this, nonetheless accepting it, I'm not going to lose sleep over or over acknowledging that, yeah, we need we need better training.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm fine with the findings of 19 dash one as. As written. I you know, I don't see any necessity to amplify it one way or another. I don't see any necessary necessity to introduce something called the Jenkins Report and all that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just just accept it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you for sharing that. And Vice Mayor Knox White, I suspect you feel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would concur.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The same. Okay. So so with that then and actually what I'm also going to propose is that we take a vote on each each one of these items, just so it's clear for the record. So, Madam Clerk, and where we may have times where we're actually going to do some editing of the the letter that's in the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'staff report, in this case, the editing is just delete, delete, delete all. Okay. Is it okay? It's up before us now. Yeah. Okay. So. But I would say it is simply agree. And the bottom paragraph. While the city of Alameda currently provides area at it, it's just degree that goes so, so moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're on a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And let me explain. This is a finding. It's in the recommendations where we're going to, you know, give meet to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. Right. Right, right. Okay. So. So we have a motion. You want to second that? Okay. We have a motion. And second, all in favor. I, I look at that unanimity. Okay. We will move on then. So let me ask it a little differently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll still take separate votes. Does anybody on the findings? 19 Dash Tuna, 19 Dash three and 19 dash four have other than an agree that they want to offer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the one where I do have there's a slight march which.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Went.'",
        "'speaker_5': '19 dash to is the one where I would I do have a slight modification to the language because the language that's in there right now does not accurately characterize the charter review process that's underway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And go ahead. And then before I interrupt, you could to explain.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As a council, we made the decision to bifurcate the charter implications resulting from Councilmember Avella and Councilmember Otis actions in 2017. We made a decision to bifurcate that from the charter review process that is described in the in the in the, in the draft letter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the agreement was that that council itself would take on the matter of what kind of the remedies that we would come up with to deal with the seven, specifically to deal with a7-3 step.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilmember Daza, if I could just interject that this is a finding. And so it is talking about the city of our need is charter at this point in time, at the point in time where the grand jury reviewed the charter in conjunction with their investigation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think your points would perhaps be better applied when we come to the recommendations. I'm just talking about the finding. Finding 19 dash to the city of Almeida's charter fails to provide enforcement mechanisms when council members and staff violate provisions of the of the charter, creating uncertainty when such violations occur.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just that let me be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clear, Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the draft letter to Judge Carvell under finding 19 Dash two currently we have before us two options. Well, I would not move forward with option two. What I'm saying is option one has kind of it doesn't tell the full story of what we're doing, that's all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I make a recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually I just want to clarify that because this actually bothered me about the staff report. If all we were being asked to do, if we agreed, was to agree with that explanation, I think the and I know staff was well and trying to capture a lot of different views.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't again, that that verbiage doesn't belong in the explanation of the finding. It belongs over in the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The words are used where you were.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was just going to propose that we just say response. Agree.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. End of story. Much in the same way. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would that be a motion?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That would be my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would there be a second? Second? All right, all in favor. Okay. So the response to 19, Dash two, Madam Clerk, who's our scribe, is just agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So moving on, finding 19 Dash three from the grand jury is council members who were the obvious subjects of the independent investigation were allowed to participate in the editing of the outside investigators report, damaging the independence of the analysis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And again, I'm just going to voice my disagreement with going into the explanation in the draft letter that, well, you know, it might have, but then we released the report, but that would be arguing that then we released the flawed report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, I think this one is just an agree or maybe it's not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let me member decide.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For if there's any frustration on the part of the public here or the viewing public. My reaction to the findings is that where the real meat on the bones occurs is in our response to the recommendations section. So there are four recommendations section, and that's separate from the findings section.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if somehow you feel like, wait, all they're doing is saying yes to 2 to 19, that's 119. That's to 19, actually 19. That's four. Yes, we are doing that. But only because, you know, if you're not ready to accept the findings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doesn't that say something? And if you're going to quibble over the findings, does that say something about your, you know, follow through potential when it comes to recommendations? So at a minimum, let us at least accept the findings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is for that reason I'm suggesting that we not, as I said from the outset, that we not read too much language into it. Let's just accept it. I mean, it was a historic and the findings are historic unto themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you like to make a motion?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Agree. I agree with finding number 19, dash three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you so you move that our response to 1993 will be agree. So second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All in favor. I oppose abstain motion carries unanimously. Okay. The fourth and last finding in violation of the city's charter they had sworn to uphold. Two council members did interfere with the city manager's ability to conduct an open and transparent recruitment for a new fire chief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Every day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So let me throw in one more qualifying comment. I am of the opinion that as a council member when I agree with finding that 19 days for that in plain English says in violation of the city charter these two these two council members had sworn to uphold.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Two council members did interfere. I am of the opinion that I am making sending a straightforward message that we did not agree with the actions that had occurred in 2017 and subsequent to that. So I believe that maybe in agree using one word agree to finding 19 dash four.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To me, one word is as powerful as 100 words or 200 words. So that's why. I'm okay with just agreeing with 19 dash four and one through three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And again, our options are agree, disagree wholly or disagree partially. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I will move approval of our response being agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. I will second that. Now, let me make sure to say when I'm responding to agree, I am not accepting the verbiage. It's just a we agree. That's okay. Thank you. Thank you. The second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What does that mean?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it's nice to see the way the way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That the draft letter is written. And then there's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, you know, and I'm so and also with three. I do want you to get rid of the additional verbiage. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I did. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Oh, you're doing that? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's on our screen. It's just a little smaller. Okay, so you made a motion and you seconded, right? Okay. All in favor. Hi. Okay. So the findings are all unanimous. And again, they're all one word responses. No explanations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're having a little technical difficulty. Your I will just noted that the vice mayor was actually going to make it even simpler by just saying findings 19 dash one through 19 dash.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For agree agree.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To all. I hate it when he shows me up like that. You're not kidding. Okay, let's move then to the recommendations. I'm vice mayor. Do you want to take the lead on that? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I believe similarly. So I wrote up some notes here. I believe we need to I believe we should accept the recommendations. I would change some of the language because I think that the proposed language, which I believe is for the most part, an option one each time, suggests that things have not been done when actually we have'",
        "'speaker_6': 'been taking action on some of these things before the grand jury report came out. So on on 19 Dash one, I would recommend that our response be this recommendation will be implemented in the near future. Staff City staff expects to return to the council at an agenda sized public meeting within the next six months to provide recommendations'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on implementation of this policy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for the benefit of the audience that might not be following along. Recommendation one is that the the City Council must establish policies for mandating initial training in orientation and ongoing training for elected officials and senior staff related to ethics and governance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember de so I am of the opinion that the so now this is where we start putting meat on the bones, you know, so, so this is where we start putting meat on the bones. I am of the opinion that the response should be the following.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The City of Alameda will implement strategies and develop a work plan for implementation. City staff will return to council at an agenda public meeting for update and discussion. Not more than six months after this, Will says, we will do it, it, it, it, it it confirms that we are taking this seriously and we're giving ourselves a timeline'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Not, I believe the phraseology of will conduct additional research on implementation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a little yeah, we were we were getting rid of their verbiage. That was. Although Madam click are you how how's that working?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, if I wanted to allow you guys to deliberate, I didn't want to type something until you've had consensus or. I mean, if you want me to just try and type both options and then have them up, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you read back what Councilmember De Sykes said? I feel like it might be the same thing the vice mayor said, but with a little.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'More.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Affirmative dramatic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Type it. But I think if you go a little bit far I could type it as you say it can you could you reread it again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Slowly this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Scratch sentence one recommendation 19 dash one requires further analysis. No. The new will read as follows The city of Alameda will implement strategies and develop a work plan for implementation. City staff will return to council at an agenda meeting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was there a timeframe?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, maybe six months. I mean, not more than six says not more than six months. I'm going to work within that. Not more than six months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that reasonable stuff? Yeah. Well, you wrote it. This is true. Why am I asking you that? And I mean, I do think that it is important. It's part of the closure that we address this soon. But, you know, you you all should feel free to chime in if you have some things that you want us to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'hear. Okay. You know, city attorney, the city clerk, city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just want to add one point of a technical point, please. Penal code requires that if we are going this route, which is that the recommendation will be implemented, we must lead the sentence with the recommendation has not been implemented.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Okay. So we must lead with that. But then we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Continue.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'With the the city of Alameda will implement the protocol requires a leading phrase that it has not been implemented. And I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why we have a city attorney sitting here. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and that was exactly my question. There are the same there is multiple options that you have to use. And that's exactly what I was going to ask about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I would say let's keep it legal. So on the recommendations, yes, please use the the responses with the necessary language and in the first sentence, but then.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Essentially an option to. But Councilmember De Sung has said instead of city staff expects to return to council, the city staff will return to council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The recommendation does not that will be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then essentially when he proposed his option to with the meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So cities have yet down an option to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of got it here is that little.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Farther down option to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought Councilmember de SAC said will see development and will implement strategies and develop a plan. Climate mobilization. Sorry that little thing daily and city staff will and then sentence above is what the city attorney needed added. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So option two goes away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, no. Option two does go away. It might. The changes that I indicate are for option one. The City of Alameda will implement and develop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. The option one just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, the word option. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. Okay. So that first sentence has two states has the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just pulled up the sentence from option two that the city attorney indicated was needed? So is that correct? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good. Good with you. Okay. So do we vote to approve this language?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member. Dave Oh yeah. Second rate all in favor of this wording before us. I think that passed unanimously. So we go on to recommendation to city clerk. You want to read the recommendations?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are going to count. City Council must investigate possible charter or municipal code amendments to clarify and strengthen provisions relating to city governance. The Charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, Dash three, as well as outline an enforcement process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So who wants to lead on this one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh. City manager, Mr. Lovett.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we had. So I was thinking that on your statement 19 dash one the you were saying six months from when. Tonight. But city attorney was saying that it would be six months from the issuance. So I would ask that you say six months from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The day, the letter, which is tonight. That way, if it ends up going to the end of December or first week of January or January, we don't we aren't in violation of your statement. I'm hoping to be sooner, but just in case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Six months from the date of this letter. Is that what you're saying?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's what I'm requesting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So six months. It's July. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Are you okay with that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay. So now. Okay, we've just heard recommendation 19, dash two. So, uh, anybody want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I said my recommendation on recommendation 19. Dash two is to start off with language that. That ignore that that says that we the city of Alameda agrees with recommendation 19, dash two and then all the language that you see in there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But then at the word at the end of the word enforcement process, period. Add the following phraseology as well as outline and enforcement. Process. Process perron such as? Censure. Comma City Council sponsored recall. Karma. Etc..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would prefer to keep details of this out, I think. I think that we're getting well ahead of ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Limits of my touch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So hold that thought. I actually worked on this one a little since it was I who named the subcommittee. The two of you. So what I said, and you can just listen to this, and if you don't like it, we'll do something else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I said, whatever the magic language is, we need to hit first magic language. And then upon being sworn into office in December 2018, Mayor Maryland, as he Ashcraft noted that quote, I have this that I can hand you to Laura in quotation in Alameda, The public trust has been shaken by turbulent events of this past year'",
        "'speaker_0': 'period. We need to restore public trust and make city government more effective. One place to start is by bringing our city charter in line with current day needs and realities. Close quote. Mayor, as he Ashcraft established a city charter subcommittee consisting of Vice Mayor Knox, Wade and Councilmember desire to review the city charter and return to the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'council with proposed changes and amendments to provide greater guidance and clarity to city officials, staff and the public. So I would I believe the two of you as a subcommittee are still doing your work, and I believe you're going to come back to that in the fall to the council with these proposals.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So rather than wordsmithing what those proposals would be, you could bring them back to us in a package at that time. But your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I hear what you're saying. And let me just first address my concern about this goes to what I was saying from the outset, the paragraph that begins on March 16th, 2019, the charter review process. That whole paragraph only tells part of the story of the charter review process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if we're going to have that paragraph in there, and I think this is important, we also have to have a separate paragraph that says as part of that, something along the lines of as part of the charter review process, city council as a whole agreed to separate out the the situations that led up to 7-3 violations'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and the possible remedies to that. And that the city council would have a week because we said we ourselves were going to have a conversation about the remedies. So that's where where we would begin to address, you know, should it be censure or should it be a city council sponsored recall or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that is a missing paragraph because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's hear from your subcommittee member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I was. I was. Yeah, I was okay with the language you proposed. It didn't actually have any this kind of what I would call extraneous. The workshop wasn't about this item. It feels odd to even mention it, even though it did happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did a lot of work, but it didn't talk about this issue. I like the idea that we have a subcommittee. You and I are working on it. We're going to bring back some recommendations for discussion at the City Council at an agenda meeting in the fall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's kind of what we're and that's what we're doing. I think it basically says we're on it and we're moving it forward.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I agree. Then I think, though, that for purposes of the residence and for the purpose of giving clarity to the grand jury, because also we the judge is going to be looking at this and say, okay, what's the timeline when they're going to get it done?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We again, have to give a timeline as to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you'd go with my language if we could put in a timeline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where does that go and what do we say? Yeah, you're right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To provide greater guidance and clarity to city officials, staff and the public. The work is expected to return to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will return.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Will return.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will exactly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will return.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Yes. The next update and discussion will return to the full council in early fall 2019. For consideration. You know, it will be considered to put before the voters in 2020. Right. Oh, that's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good clarification. So so when we're talking about amending the charter, this is done by a vote of the people. So it is not something that this council can sit here tonight and do or when we come back in September.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But among the things they're looking at, they're looking at a number of things that may go on the ballot in 2020, either the March primary or the June general election. So you'd be coming back to us in six months with those recommendations?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I think the last time the council discussed this, we decided not March because it's nothing on the just to set expectations. There's nothing local on the March ballot. So it would be an $800,000 addition for us to join, whereas it's much cheaper for us to go next November.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I'd say that conversation is still taking place in different quarters, but yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, several things let me make sure to capture. I mean, my thoughts are that, you know, if we're going to reference the city charter review process, that we then need to clarify that that we had bifurcated the process that we, in an effort to take seriously, take in an effort to take seriously by the city council members'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the 7-3 item, which is has to do with the charter that says you can't interfere in job selections, hiring selections. And that I think we should also have language that says that city that the charter review committee will return to the city council as a whole with our recommendations with regard to 7-3 violations and again giving the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'timeline. And I think it gives and I think that's important because we as a council have have decided to separate out 7-3 from the other charter review process. By the way, the other charter I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Don't think that was actually the council that was you and I as the subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will just I will just interject that I don't really think the presiding judge cares about bifurcation. I think that Judge Carvell just cares about what we're going to do with regard to recommendation 19, Dash two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can we just can we can we just the one thing that's not overly overly clear, right? It just so if we go back to the the subcommittee will return will continue their work providing regular updates to the city council and consideration of potential changes to the charter on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. So that we're being clear for consideration of presentation to voters in 2020. The next update in discussion by the full Council is expected will occur in early fall 2019.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can that be said with fewer words? Probably skip every window did. I mean, we just want to let the judge know that the subcommittee work is continuing. I mean, do you anticipate more than one update or do you think you're going to be ready to come forward with a recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember Desai whatever the recommendations are. Again, going back to what I said from the outset, I want to respond to the plain text reading of what the grand jury report says and the plain text reading of recommendation 19.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dash two specifically calls out some kind of response to seven, Dash three. So all I'm saying is that that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When we say we're coming back with charter review amendments, we have to specifically say how we're going to come back, that we're going to come back with Charter Review Amendments two seven, Dash three that align with the concerns raised in recommending that recommendation 19 Dash two those concerns being the need to clarify and the need to strengthen'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Right. And I would just tend to delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of 7-3, as well as outline and enforcement process. So you all are going to work on that in the subcommittee. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And let me let me just for the edification of the public, because the charter review process has coming down the pike deals with. District voting deals with ranked choice voting and to other items. So I don't want us just to think that and those things that I just enumerated are not related to 7-3.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I want to be clear to the judge or whomever that we will. You know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It just. I agree. Can we just can we just add that to the the language? And I think we're I think we're all saying the same thing and we're all in agreement. So if we can just get that written, maybe we can just vote to move this thing forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I'm mindful of the fact we have far more media, three or four media items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's ten, 1030. Okay, almost. What do you have, madam? Close to what? I think we need to give you a quick a little more direction on what we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going to need. The same first sentence in the response, right? Yep. Oh, let me. I'm right here. Okay. And then I. So we're we we're sticking with this. Are we going with what they may have read you? I know we're talking to the end of it, but the beginning part she's I keep on hitting that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I feel like let's go with whatever is shorter. Okay. Well, I would I don't want that second paragraph about everything that happened on March 16th. So just delete that, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can we can we change in recent months to in December 2018?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yeah. And to start in December 2018.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then and then at the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'End, the mayor established a subcommittee. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The. Let's see. So, yeah, they arrested the city officials, staff and the public. The subcommittee will return.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just go right to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To the full city council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That last sentence.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With proposed changes to seven. Dash three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The suits will return. Oh, jeez. I'm really bad at this keyboard. Maybe I'll go to other keyboards. I would kill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She's doing well where? I didn't see where that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is what I read more or less earlier.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I was.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just saying, if it got typed, then we can. So.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the in the language that was just mentioned now. I would mimic the language that's in the grand jury report. Don't just say return with changes to seven, dash three. I would say, well, come return with changes that clarify and strengthen and outline an enforcement process with regard to 7-3.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's what the language says. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think the prescriptive part of that paragraph is the charter should delineate the specific types of conduct constitute a violation as well as outline enforcement. So that's what I would be looking for you to bring back. And then I think by doing that, you're satisfying the direction in the previous sentence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An enforcement process clarifies and strengthens as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I would say if I were doing it, I would say that the subcommittee will return with a report delineating the specific types of conduct as well as outlining, you know, dot, dot, dot, as well as outlining an enforcement process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think by doing that, you're satisfying the clarity and strengthening that the grand jury is asking for recommending.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I say instead of a report. Can we say a proposal? I don't know that it's going to be a report. I think it's going to be a proposal. It's a potential language for discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proposal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Problem with that. And it's a problem that's inherent in the way that the grand jury wrote this report. So the way the recommendation the third paragraph reads, the third paragraph reads the recommendation 19 dash two sentence to the charter should delineate the specific types of conduct that constitute a violation of Section seven, DASH three.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we're starting to violate the getting into the weeds. I don't think we have to be so precise, so prescriptive as to I think the idea with responses to grand jury stuff at work on a regular basis because the San Francisco grand jury is very, very well busy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and I think that this would be this would be a fine. I think they just want to hear we're going to look we're looking at it, we're coming back and it's in motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that satisfies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For my to be satisfied that I'm trying to convey something to the public. What I'm trying to convey is this in in my delineating seven, dash three as said here, my effort is not to re change the plain text language of 7-3 that says neither the Council nor any members shall interfere with the execution of the city'",
        "'speaker_5': 'managers. Not to change that, nor is it to change an attempt by a council member to influence the city manager in the making of. So by delineating, I don't anticipate changing that. I anticipate focusing on enforcement processes because that's what's that and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're saying that councilmember de so that's that sentence that right there the subcommittee will return to council with the proposal delineating the specific types of misconduct that constitute a violation of Section seven three, as well as outlining an enforcement process not more than six months after the date of this letter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I appreciate that. I just have to say it out loud.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you don't need the language in the letter, right? Great. Do we have a motion to accept that wording moved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Second all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In favor. I. Okay, that pass. Let's move on to 19 dash three. Okay. So 19 dash three. I will read it. The American City Council should adopt a policy stating that council members who knowingly violate ethical codes of conduct or charter provisions may not seek reimbursement for related legal representation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thoughts. Comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now that I understand the has not been implemented, I would propose we just go straight with option number two. It has the timeline. It says it's going to implement this thing, it will implement this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a question for the city attorney then this came up with in some of the comments. Is there a reason we can't implement a change now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because it's not agenda? Madam Chair, the agenda provides that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council for the response.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The Council is providing guidance for the response of the Council wishes to actually implement the policy. We should agenda set for a future meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And is it necessary to wait and looking back through the responses. Is it necessary to wait for what do we say, six months.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And expects to return within?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um. Is it possible? I mean, do we have to have everything come back at the same time in six months or could some things come back sooner?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No, everything does not need to come back all in one package. They could come back piecemeal. I will defer to the city manager on timeframes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City manager, your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For this particular this particular one. Yeah. So in some ways. This is for this particular one. So in some ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'She didn't speak into the microphone. So everyone captures what you saw.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in some ways, this is probably the some of the others are going to take more length in some of the research or how well developed the policies in this one. This one is probably a little more complex than that as as you as a city council know and dealing with litigation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anytime there's claims, there's always things. So I think it could come back probably in four months and then you could have a discussion on it. I mean, probably I would say. For four months. I mean. There's always all these nuances on any type of litigation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So because this is talking about future claims. So there's always there's anticipated issues on litigation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Mr. Shen I think to add to the city manager's comment, I think that I'll echo his concern that given that there are ongoing claims that this policy may or may not implicate city managers wisely, advising some cost prudence and giving us sufficient time to get to the right place.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think we're coming back within six months, and I think I heard the city manager say as soon as possible. But giving us additional latitude is a wise decision.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And of course, we don't discuss pending litigation in open session, but we also don't want to do anything that would jeopardize pending litigation.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Precisely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai, would you like to comment?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my druthers with this is similar to what we said before is something along the lines of. Option two as modified. This recommendation has not yet been implemented, but will be implemented in the future. The City Council at an agenda public meeting within the next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Eight months, six months will provide recommendations, will implement that will implement this policy. We're being asked to implement something historic has happened and we're being asked to change our policies. So we need to rise to the level of the historical importance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're being asked to adopt a policy. We have none at this point.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Exactly. But I'm saying we're going to commit to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think I heard the city manager say it could come back within four months. But do the two of you concur on that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As I said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Enthusiasm is palpable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I said for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I said four months that we can come back with options for you to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So let's. Okay. So. Instruments will, yes. Provide recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you just like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We aren't going to implement this in four months, that's not what's being recommended.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll will provide recommendations for implementation of this policy. Derek Kilmer deserves.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just think we should do what we have to. When we devise a policy, we have to implement it. So we will we will implement a policy. Right. So there's no need to say provide recommendations to implement. We will adopt a policy one way or another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we will you as a city council always have the option whether you don't adopt a policy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But the thing is, we don't have options here. We do. It's the grand jury thing that you will adopt if you agree with the findings, which we did. You will adopt a policy. So we have to adopt a policy.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not sure if it's that clear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that's not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How it works. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I, I'm fine with. I intend to adopt to work to adopt a policy. The grand jury does not direct our work and cannot compel us to adopt a policy. They are saying that they are recommending that we are doing it and we are telling them we intend to do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We are planning to do that. And a year from now, if for whatever reason, we can't get to a policy that we like or there's legal, legal issues or whatever else, we will be asked to report on whether or not we did it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at the end of the day, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I like what's written.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Its recommendations will be original within the next four months, will provide recommendations for implementation of this policy. I find this affirmative councilmember desire. We're saying we're going to do it for months. We have to respect that. There's some litigation and it takes some time for staff to put this together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But no one's saying it's not happening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Four months instead of six months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's there, right there in front of us for months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. You want to move approval of that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not going to move for a wait.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I want to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We may want to say four months from the date of this meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Oh, okay. Rather than within the next four months. Within four months of the date of the letter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which is what we're saying in the other things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So do I have a motion? So moved in a second.'",
        "'speaker_5': '1/2.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will. Second. All in favor. I. Okay. That passed. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Last one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I don't do that often. Okay, last one. Recommendation 19 dash four chest went away. The Alameda City Council, working with the city attorney, city manager and city clerk must develop and implement a code of Conduct and Council Member Handbook.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this one's pretty straightforward, I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Vice Mayor I would just that's pretty recommend option two. I would take what I would call the data edit and change expects to return to will return. Um, and I'm just going to look to city staff to make sure that now that they know what their what they've signed up for whether six months is the realistic policy'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and it's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Within six months from the date of this letter rather than within the next six months. I'm Mr. Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm relatively comfortable on the implementation development implementation of code of conduct. I'm a little more concerned on the councilmember handbook because that's a possibly a more lengthy document. And so what.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Timeframe would you recommend?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd say a year for the second part, but six months for the first part I'd be comfortable with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How do we feel about that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. That's the city manager's.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that can really mean it's not even on the screen yet, guys. Okay, we're getting there. So. So city staff will return to council. Oh. So we're directing or the. Oh yeah. That is. This is staff which you see within the next six, within six months we can get rid of the next within six months of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the date of this letter to provide recommendations on developing a code of conduct. And within one year from the date of this letter to provide recommendations on developing and by the way, the verb is developing in the previous line I developing a council member handbook.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customer Handbook? Yes. And Madam Clark, if you look at the third line to provide recommendations on, it's developing now. Thank you. Okay. How does that sound? Colleagues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I wanted to ask.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is it an option.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If the option to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A large.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I would put a I would put a comma after conduct for developing a code of conduct comma and within one year from the date to provide because those are two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I've got another little wordsmithing on the first line. Let's make it. These recommendations have not been implemented since we're bifurcating the handbook from the Code of Conduct. So these recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, except its recommendation 9.4.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uh. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just. I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's recommended.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The recommendation has not been done. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Good. Move. Approval. Okay. I have a motion to have a second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will second that and let me just offer my closing comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, let's vote on it first. Your closing comments in the whole thing. Yeah, yeah. Let's vote on this finding, then you put your closing comments. Okay, we have a motion. We have a second. All in favor of recommendation 90 dash for the response to 90.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dash four. I. Okay. That passed unanimously closing comments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But can we. Can I make just a motion? I'd like to just approve the letter as written. There's an intro in and out, whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want an opening paragraph in the closing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Yeah. Which is as proposed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that okay with you?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Yes. And I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember de SACS, closing comments. Yes. Well, that was a motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm going to move move approval of the full letter and authorize the mayor to send it on our behalf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the full letter as we've revised it tonight. Okay. I have a motion to have a second. And then you can make your comments. And how about we get a motion second? We have a discussion if this is the topic that you want to discuss.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Um. Yeah. I think somewhere along the lines we have to recognize that the people want more information and we have to recognize that the implementations strategies that that we're going to do that that are going to result from it when we were discussing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we have to give a flavor as to what we're talking about. And I think the way that you do that is have a sentence that's in the final paragraph that at least acknowledges the fact that something along the lines of residents of Alameda through throughout this process, residents of Alameda have voiced a desire for not'",
        "'speaker_5': 'only transparency in the form of of any information, including electronic recordings being released, but also for for strong remedies, including censure, as well as some form of city recall. I'm not saying that we're going to do censure. I'm not saying that that that we're going to do recall.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All I'm saying is I'm trying to reflect the fact that the people have said that. And so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Desai I would submit that the people have said a lot of things here tonight and that was said by a few, but not all. And I also think that that language is going beyond the scope of what the presiding judge is asking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that we want to be responsive to the findings and recommendations. I think we've done that. And I think there's still time as these matters come back to us to explore how we implement what the people want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think we've done our task.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, that I just I don't think that's an appropriate statement to put in a letter to the judge that this letter to the judge is not a letter to the community. And I, I think, per se, I think you've been very clear that that that is where you see this going and important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's incumbent upon each of us to communicate to not just our our entire community, but the community of the message that we'd like them to hear. But I would not feel comfortable, including in a response to the grand jury judgment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Statement that is not really written as a part of the response that we are legally required to give. It starts to muddy up what the what this document is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think we're very close to completing this task and getting this letter sent off to the. The presiding judge in response to the grand jury's findings. I would hate to have to bring this back in September because we couldn't agree on the first and last paragraph after doing all this work up until now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would ask you, council member decide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go with the first and last paragraphs as staff wrote them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, let me just say. You know what people are upset about, as I said from the very outset, is that. There is a that the grand jury report has clearly indicated that some have felt that they are above the law and that that we have a process in place that's not transparent enough to gather information, to demonstrate'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the extent to which. Some have been above the law and that's hence the call for four tapes because they want to hear it themselves. But they've also been frustrated. The people have been frustrated by the inadequacy of remedies.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In seven, dash three, seven, Dash three says this is the penalty, but the way in which the penalties implement implement is not clear. And I just wanted to somehow capture that in the letter to the judge, because I think that underscores the the importance and historic nature of this and the way in which residents are concerned.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But and I would submit to you that everything we've done in terms of our agreement with the grand jury's findings and the responses that we have made in response to those findings does everything you said without your specific interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the simple fact is you don't have two votes to go with you. So either we move this letter forward now and get it sent off to the grand jury, which I think is sending a powerful message in itself that the city council is ready to address this issue head on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or we. Come back after our break in September and are really pressed for time and try to get the closing paragraph written. And I just think that you've had your say, and I think there's other ways to communicate to the people that you're referring to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is a letter to the presiding judge of the Superior Court, and it is time to put closure on this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that the power of this document is in the fact that three council members, a majority of the city council members, have agreed with grand jury findings. And the grand jury findings are. I mean, they were pretty serious stuff and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think, you know, I, I think it is time to move on. People know how I feel on the other issues. And we'll and through the process that we talked about through recommendations 19 at 19.2 or 9.2.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, we'll deal with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Your remarks have been noted. I have a motion to the vice mayors made to send the letter. As we have. I drafted it with our edits. Second, I have a second all in favor. The motion passes unanimously.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, everyone. Okay, so yes, you may.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know it's not typical, but I just. I feel like we have gone through a lot. I wonder, I, I instead of speaking before we voted, because I know the U.S. Council member decided to wait until after. Would like to just say a couple of you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'May.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Things not quite as prepared as I actually expected it to be. I don't think this was an easy evening for for any any of the folks up here. I think at the end of the day, our city council has said that things did not go the way that they should have gone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I it would be hard for me to believe that anybody can kind of look at the acrimony and everything else that has happened over the last year and a half that happened two years ago, actually, and not see the things things went badly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, from my standpoint. I think this council has acknowledged that mistakes were made. And I think we have said that, and we acknowledge that unanimously and actually quite civilly. And I also hear Councilmember de SOG and mayor as the Ashcraft, and I'll say it right now as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think it's also time for our community to move forward and move on. We can't control political conversations around this and whatever else. You know, I, for one, believe that both the investigative report and the grand jury came to the right conclusion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People made mistakes. It doesn't mean that they should be removed from office. I, for one, am willing to accept this. We don't have a censure process right now, but this is about as close as a council can get to it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Public bodies all over the the region, the state, the nation have censure processes. People get censured. You move on and you start working together. And I believe that strongly that we can do that tonight. And I'm actually just asking the community to find a way to join us in figuring out how we can move forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There is no process for removing people. There is an election in a year. People can certainly, you know, have their say at the ballot box and whatnot, and everybody will. But I think it's now time for our community to move forward and be the best animator we can be.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I want to thank both my my my colleagues. Those are my statements. You know, I'm sure we all have a slightly different perspective, but I want to thank you. This was a civil and respectful conversation. And I appreciate this because it was not easy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. My very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Briefly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Brief closing comment is simply that I don't believe that the city of Alameda is ready to move on yet. It's only when we look at the recommendations that we come at that come out of our specific charter review committee and council recommendation that come out of 19 dash two on how we are going to strengthen 7-3.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's the only time when when I think healing can begin. I think right now there is still kind of a scab there that hasn't healed yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will concur that I think the process takes time. But I think we took a very important first step. And no, it wasn't easy, but when we signed up for this job, we signed up to take responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we've done that tonight. So thank you very much. If we could bring I'm just getting close to 11:00 and. Okay. Five minute break. Can we do 5 minutes? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So do you think a vote as soon as you get back to continue continuing to do what you want to do. Well, need to wait for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Um, you know what? I actually saw that you just. Could we get everyone to take their seats, please? Amelia, can.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We can vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We thank you, everyone. We have to vote because it's almost 11:00. We have to take a vote. And we need for affirmative votes to continue items past 11 so that the four remaining items are item six. C is the the midway developer and exclusive negotiating agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Six Stormwater Fees. Six Zoning for New Fires Facility. 90 is a referral, a council referral and the Commission on Disability. I will just throw in that. I would be okay if we didn't get all the way to the council referral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do think that six Sydney are important to be heard tonight. Do I have a motion to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And count? Yes. Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Could we consider limiting the amount of speaker time? In light of the late hour on the remaining items.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What do you propose?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd like to reduce the speaker time by commit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, if we could reduce it by 2 minutes. That was.'",
        "'speaker_0': '2 minutes. It. Well, do we have many public speakers. We have four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We could reduce it to 2 minutes each. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's for just for this item or for all of the remaining customs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or just for the six C, there's four speakers on 60 and no others.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we could we could potentially get more speaker slips.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Okay. I, I, I mean, that's okay with me. What do we think?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll be okay with that? I'm sorry. That's okay. I'll be okay with that. But can staff kind of be concise too because.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sure. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So there's no some of these issues are like the second or third time, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, okay. And Vice Mayor, I'm supportive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to make sure nobody is here to address the commission and disability issue because I didn't see folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Earlier, I did see a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Lag.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if anybody was planning on staying here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you leave? I do not see anyone here in the commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I'm sorry. We do have one more speaker slip on six D as well. One for. Yeah. No, I my proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My proposal is that we hear all of the regular agenda item six Sydney and but that we drop the council referral until our September meeting is okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'On. Okay. Have a motion to have a second. Hours growing later, picking oak has been moved by the vice mayor, seconded by Councilmember Odie. All in favor. I have any abstention, any loss that I have from you, Councilmember.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Hi. Selecting a development team for the West Midway Project and authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute an exclusive negotiation. Right. To negotiate agreement. Sorry. With Selected Development team. Okay. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. We're looking for the CliffsNotes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Version of the statue is, um, let's see. We're here tonight to recommend that you select the development team for the West Midway Project and that you authorize the city manager to execute an exclusive negotiation agreement with selected development team.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Um, you familiar with the area of the map and exhibit one? And the process has basically been, uh, we came here about a year ago, July 10th, you authorized the RFQ, we've received seven qualified proposals. And in February you narrow the field down to two finalists, alameda point and Jamestown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cypress Equity Investments. Uh, have some members Odion de sag. They're appointed to a subcommittee to develop supplemental questions for staff intended to gain more information about the finalists. Um, between March 6th and March, uh, May 6th, the two finalists, Alameda Point Partners and Jamestown.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I requested additional time to explore potential partnership to develop West Midway and submitted responses in supplemental questions. On May 21st, Jamestown withdrew the developer selection process due to uncertainty about the viability of a commercial development. Given the phasing and increased costs of infrastructure with the withdrawal of Jamestown CEI, there are few alternatives that council can take tonight'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in selecting a development team. One Council could select AP as the remaining finalists shortlisted by council, and they have completed the supplemental questions. Another alternative is to reconsider. Brookfield, Brookfield Residential and or Telis Council could confirm that there is they are still interested based on their original submittal and then require them to respond to the supplemental questions'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Another alternative is to reinstate the RFQ process, which would take about 6 to 9 months before coming back to council for a final selection. Um, so staff's recommendation of council is to select a development team for West Midway and authorize, um, execution of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will say that each of the development teams has a representative here to speak to any questions you might have. And that concludes my presentation. I'd be happy to answer your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Nice work. Any clarifying questions on the separate? I want to just hasten to thank my colleagues, Councilmember Odie and Councilmember De. So you did a nice job on the questions that were posed to the finalists, so thank you for for your work on that subcommittee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we go ahead and here are public speakers and then have our deliberations. Okay, let's do that. And so I think we've said 2 minutes per public. Speaker So go ahead, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Karen Bay, Joe Ernst, Doug Biggs and Bruce Starkman.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening, Buttermere City Council Staff. So it's been more than two years since the Main Street neighborhood specific plan was approved. It's been a year since CRF two was issued. We had four developers that were shortlisted and then we narrowed it down to two.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'One of those developers, James Town, backed out and said, We're left with a two point partners. I think it's time to move forward and make a decision. And I'm here to support our point partners and let them choose a partner if they so desire to choose a partner.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We've been through this before where we selected a partner for someone and it didn't work. And so I think AP Partners has earned the project at this point. They've been vetted. Are their financially committed? They have a great vision for the project.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They've done their due diligence. They know the project site. They have a great construction team that's ready to go. And I think that there's benefit by having sort of a this master developer that has a vision so that we don't have a sort of a hodgepodge type of project with people, developers with different visions.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think there's a great benefit to having them move forward with the Main Street Development Project. So I urge you to select Alameda Point Park. Nice for the Main Street Project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. Bay. I just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor Ashcraft, members of the council. I'm Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I'll try to make this quick. I'm happy to be here and talk about this because I do as I've mentioned to many before, I do believe we bring a lot to the table here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainty. I think we can deliver with shorter time frames. We've already gone through the process of negotiating DDA documents, etc. with the city. We have a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience in working with the various systems that agencies issues, economies.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We know cost here is critical and we have with our phase one work site A, we can bring economies with that work. Vision, I believe our vision for the project is most consistent with with delivering reshape, which is so critical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But also the other objectives that we've talked about for years jobs, social impact, trip generation, transit development and reduction of trips. But I want to address, most importantly, you know, one of your big concerns. One we respect. And that's the issue of diversity.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I appreciate the questions about how do we mitigate risk, be comfortable. You know, we know what gets funded. I think all of the developers in this room know that a well-designed, thoughtful project that has community support, that will pencil and then is delivered by an experienced operator, you know, we all go through whether we have our own'",
        "'speaker_4': 'capital or we work with third parties. It's a very efficient market we go through. We have fiduciary responsibilities to investors, independent boards. So at the end of the day, you know, projects that get funded are those that pencil and have experienced operators who've demonstrated track record.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we went through that with City. We ran into issues in 2016.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. 2 minutes. Okay. Next, I see Doug Biggs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name's Doug Biggs, executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative. And speaking here on behalf of the Reshape Collaborative Partners. You want to get out of here before midnight? We want to get out of this process before the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First and foremost, take the idea of an RFP off the table. That is just untenable. There is a lot of funding coming down the pike now for housing and we need to take advantage of it and we need to be ready to do this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And lengthy delays in selecting the metro developer for the Main Street project will severely impact that it's time to move forward. We early on met with all four partners. We determined that all four are capable of fully capable of of doing the work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have full faith in them. We've enjoyed working with and meeting with each of them throughout the process. You have a process you embarked on last year that has resulted in having one, one, one developer standing tonight. And you either need to move forward on that or, you know, if you can do it without delays, you could'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do the questionnaire process as long as it's a very quick turnaround. But we you know, you set a process in motion that's resulted in where you're at tonight. There's rationale for finishing that out. There is if you feel like you need to do other vetting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there's some rationale for doing the questionnaire. We're not going to tell you which route to go. That's why you're sitting up there. But please don't do a process that's going to delay moving forward on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Bruce Dorfman, listen next. Speaker. Yes, Mr. Dorfman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I was hoping to keep it short and basically second, everything my partner Joe earned said, but he didn't get through all his points. So I'd just like to restate what we've said before, that we think that we can offer greater certainty, shorter timeframes and lower costs by moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have a DDA that we relatively recently negotiated with the city. We know the pricing for doing the work out there. We've completed the physical due diligence and understand the constraints. We have good working relationships that have been developed over the years with the city and related agencies, and we're prepared to execute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Phase one, as we discussed at the groundbreaking of BLOCK Eight last week, is going quite well now that we're out of the rainy season. And we even though we've incurred, I think it was close to 70 days of rain and weather delay, we've gotten to a very important point been the 50% completion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And frankly, the second 50% of this work we think is going to go much quicker. So we are very interested in moving forward and just getting to one of Joe's points about the diversity aspect. On phase one of site, we had six different development parcels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have sold three of those to different developers, and diversity has occurred that way. We're looking at moving forward with phase two. We're currently processing the vesting, tentative map and the infrastructure improvements that will be in front of you later on this year for review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And consequently, I think that being able to roll right into West Midway is appropriate and frankly, given the neighbor neighboring.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Dorfman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Approvals. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So I'm going to close public comment. Okay. Counsel comment. Who wants to start Councilmember Odie?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. I'll go first and I appreciate the thanks on the questionnaire. And you were.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Very helpful.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'To work with my colleague and I also appreciate the answers. And I think they were frank. They were honest. And, you know, one of the things I learned in this job is that, you know, developments don't always take as fast as you wish.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'city's perspective it was in. So I don't see any reason why we had this discussion a while back where we narrowed it to two. I mean, in an ideal world, the partnership had a lot of appeal, but one dropped out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I mean, the point of narrowing it is, you know, you narrow it and then you go, you know, with who you have. So I trust AP to get this done. They've had shovels in the ground. They know what's under there and they know what to do.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I don't see any reason why we would change horses, you know, right now and start the process over or even ask others to do the questionnaire, because this is the direction of the council from a while ago.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, thank you. Thank you also for your kind comments. Much appreciated, in my opinion. The process worked. You know, we started out with a multitude of developers through the request for a qualification process, and then it came down to two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was actually three because because one of them was like on the bubble. And then so and then we came down to the two of Jamestown and, and AP, but Jamestown, you know, fell by the wayside. And so Alameda Point Partners is and we're not backing into app.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a developer who has proven themselves and also I have always appreciated the substantial commitments that they've made through the DDA Shell shuttles running on a on a particular time frame. The amount of investments in in bus rapid transit and investments in the ferry terminal set are not to talk about not to mention the infrastructure dollars'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that that had would go down. So I'm satisfied with moving forward with staff's recommendation, with selecting a winner for the for the West Midway Project and that being AP, I appreciate the other developers who are here especially could tell us I appreciate the work that you guys have done in Bayport and also in Alameda Landing.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'If there was a you know, I think if there was somebody that I would trust to put our eggs in one basket, I said this back in February as well. They do have a history of delivering, you know, in a tough market where we've watched a number of other development entities walk away, come back and ask us'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to reduce their things so they can sell to somebody else, etc.. You know, I'll be interested to see where everybody else is.

        "'speaker_0': 'One, I was just. If you were speaking to the microphone, we could all hear you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, that there would be a concern if there's too many of the same kind of units being delivered to Mark at any one time. So that will be something knowing what we're doing with phase one today, phase two safety as we think about the product type for West Midway, that we have the ability to manage that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and not create something that's going to compete with one another and jeopardize the project.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Microphone, gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Excuse me. So we had three different product types in content. One was a rental community. Another was townhomes. The third was single family. So consequently, the the highest density project would be the largest of the three being the multifamily component.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The townhomes would be next, and then we would have the fewest number of single family homes. So the townhomes and the single family, we will be selling off to third party developers. And frankly, one thing that we're doing with phase one and phase two is we are by working with true MA Homes right now, introducing those phases'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for the townhomes specifically where there's probably saw absorption and certainly the multifamily component in, you know, every 6 to 9 months, the 60 units. So that speaks to that absorption. But I'm not overly concerned about cannibalizing, if that's what the concern is, because again, in the big scheme of things, this is relatively small.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Oh, I will present a Cliff Notes version. I'm actually starting with the last slide here, which is the staff recommendation. Now we're recommending moving forward with two resolutions to initiate a Prop 13 process for option number one, the property related fee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'll talk a little bit about this and in the presentation, let's talk about what it means. If council does move in this direction, it means that on August 10th there'll be a notice to all property owners with a fee range of between 45 and $78 annually for an average sized single, single family residence.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's an alternative here where the city council could direct staff to mail a notice with a single specific rate. That is something for the council to consider. Then we'd have a. Round of public education in August and September.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we'd have an October 1st hearing, which is really a two term, to determine whether there's a majority protest, meaning the notices that we send out on the 10th. Is there a majority protest based on those notices?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If not, then it's the council's discretion at that point to initiate the proceedings, to go out to ballot, to set an actual rate, to go out the ballot on those ballots could be mailed as soon as October 10th and would be back by November 25th with results to council in December.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that that is a timeline that could flow from action tonight. Now, I'm going to back up a little bit and just talk about how we got here back in April. Council directed staff to come back with options to explore and also some survey results to match up with those options to help the council moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And here we've laid out the two options. Number one being the property related fee in which property owners vote. Number two, the parcel tax in which registered voters vote. The big difference there being the simple majority for the property related fee and the supermajority for the parcel tax.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Unless there's burning questions about this slide, I'll keep moving.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Keep moving. I'm sorry, Councilor Rody.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I said one real quick one. You mean hypothetically under the schedule? Can you compare the date? We would know the results versus the last date possible to put something on the ballot and say if it lost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I see.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is there enough time to do it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In other words, for the March 2020 or write orders for the March 2020 ballot? I think it would be December.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's December something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right at the beginning of December.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. True.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this is coming back in October, right? The ballot would be submitted in October. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The ballots.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It would be mailed October 10th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm. And then comes back, what, November 10th, 2015?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is that enough time? I mean, I'm confident will do well, but just in case, I think we should have a backup plan, that's all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is definitely something coming out of tonight we can give more thought to in terms of how to have that back up plan, because that would also mean having staff, reports and resolutions ready to go earlier than that November 25th when ballots would be due.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Avila.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Could it be scheduled as a special meeting or does it have to be scheduled as a regular? Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a question for a city attorney or the city clerk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I can skip the question and just say I think the deadline is the beginning of December to get it into the county. So I don't know that getting a special meeting versus a regular meeting is going to give us that much more time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just I have to do the election calendar really quickly and I could try, but. Let me see. I'll try and calculate it. Really? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I had confidence in the statistics, but whatever. Did you finish? Was that especially possible? Okay. Can somebody suck?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My. Quick point of view is if it lost in November 25th, that lost. The people have spoken. There's no need to rush or have another. Yeah. Property owners have spoken so well. They're the people who vote.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I can't remember Villa.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I have a problem saying that the people have spoken. If it's the property owners. I think that there's a lot of people in Alameda who would say that they have a voice certainly for the type of election that we would be choosing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That would be the subset. But to say that the people have spoken and then dismiss them summarily from, you know, voters as voters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, you know, what I would go would probably put more stock in. Do you actually did the polling both from the the property owners, which only required a simple majority versus all the voters which required the two thirds?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it was definitely closer. I mean, they were still pretty decent results. But I, I mean, if we had to, we would the only thing I think it begs the question that if they turned it down, is that a sentiment that would be carried out?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we can explore those. I think we need to keep moving for to answer the questions that are before us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can quickly add that that in order to get something on the March 3rd, 2020 ballot, it would have to be due to the Registrar of Voters by Friday, December 6th. Okay. So really, that first meeting in December is pretty much until.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can work some stuff backwards from that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And maybe walking through the survey results slide might help the discussion. So this first slide is about the property related fees. So again, this is the universe of voters is property owners. And here we've got a simple majority threshold and under the $36 rate, that's the lower rate we found 59.5% support.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You've got to discount that by the margin of error, which is around 3%, still a healthy margin above 50%. At the higher rate, it drops to 56%. So again, with the margin of error, you still got some some room above that 50% threshold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So and no voter education to speak of to date just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Factor to consider. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And now we're turning to the parcel tax, which again has the supermajority requirement and they're at the lower rate. We're just at that threshold actually slightly above it. However, once you consider the margin of error, your error, you're actually below below that threshold.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then if you go to that higher rate, you are already under the threshold without the margin of error, and then you include the margin of error, you're further under the threshold. So I think it informs that discussion a little bit just in terms of if we were unsuccessful on the property fee, it might be a tough road'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to hoe on the on the supermajority requirement. There was a couple other pieces of information that came out of the surveys that were of interest to council, at least back in April. And that is around sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Back in April it wasn't so close to midnight. But. Okay, quickly. And do we want to do okay?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, no, I can I can skip this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to know this. Will you read this? I'm presuming. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's go to just context for a moment. The last slide and then that I will back up is just to give these stormwater fees. Some context is even at the max rate being considered on the lower left corner, you see that the max rate would be about for the new fee would be about $6.50 per month.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's on top of the current fee, which is approximately 4.67 $4.67 for a total of a little over $11 per month. And then you compare that to average monthly bills for garbage and recycling, sewer and water. And you see there's quite a bit of difference in terms of those those bills with the storm fees being much more'",
        "'speaker_7': 'modest than those other monthly bills. And so with that will land again on the recommend. Did I not. Give me one moment. Did everybody see the average monthly bills on the lower right hand corner of that slide? Uh huh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are you sure about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The $150 or any.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As as an average over the course of the year?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Prevent launch.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you're running a highly efficient household.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I won probably only that gas.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a couple questions for you, Mr. Galan. Can you explain? This is in the staff report. There is the, uh, page five of the staff report you talked about. There's two different rate structures based on storm runoff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it's modeled on estimating how much impervious surface is in each parcel. There's low development and parcels that drain into the bay. How do you how do you determine that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So I'll start us off and then I'm going to ask Jerry Bradshaw, who's an expert with CCI, consultant who helped develop the fee study. Overall, the way these fees are developed, as you look at the residential side, you're looking at per parcel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you're looking at an average sized single family home, then lower and then higher than that. And you're looking at the permeability or as this prior slide shows, just give me a moment. If you look at that sponge, you're looking at some properties, act as a sponge and keep that stormwater infiltrated on that parcel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That means they're contributing less to the stormwater system and should be charged less.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understand that. How do you figure out which is which?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am going to ask Jerry to come up to talk about the statistics behind that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm really looking for the thumbnail sketch. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We take a statistical approach to this, so we break the parcels into different groups and residential. We have we looked at all sizes of parcels and did a sampling of those and actually went on aerials and measured rooftops, driveways and anything like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we did a statistical sampling to come up with that and then broke it into size.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Groups from that helps. Thank you. Appreciate that. Okay, you're back, Mr. Garland.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or are you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone have any questions for Mr. Garland?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I have one. In determining whether or not we were to set a specific fee or send out a letter with a range of fee. What's the tradeoff? Why? Why? Why would we do one or the other?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What the range of fees affords the City Council is more discretion at that October 1st public hearing to set a fee within that range. If you set a fee now, you're bound by that fee at that October 1st public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So so I guess I. Can I make a comment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, and I you made a comment. I have a follow up question to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I guess to me, I think that the then the trade off is is there confusion caused by sending a letter that says 45 to 78 or an expectation of lower if we decide to go higher later, as opposed to determining where we'd like, where the sweet spot is that we think we would like to proceed with'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And just going with that, right, is that it's late. I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You. It seemed like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The right tradeoff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I was the one that I was the one that recommended they give you the options. If you had a specific rate that you wanted to go forward of that you could put it. And that's what my my my experience has been on to a teens, but there is an opposite experience and that is to give the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'range. So so I don't know that there's advantage one way or the other. I think it depends on your on your view. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What will we know in October that we don't know now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'll have probably not survey data to back this up. We'll have a better sense from the community and a couple of community meetings about the level of tolerance for either that a low fee versus the high fee. So it won't be a formal survey results.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll have an October 1st, but at least have anecdotal sense about what the community is sensing. Remember the big difference between the fees being one fee? Make sure we have continuity of our operations and maintenance. Another fee ensures that continuity and ensures at least a chunk of some important capital projects get done right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Planet. Oh, okay. So Council's we have a public speaker. Okay, so we'll get to our deliberation as soon as we've heard from our public speaker and our public speaker here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ruth, Abby?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ruth. Abby. Oh, there's another one who was here for the 530 idea being everyone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just to let you know that I think there's a constituency out there that really believes that this is sort of essential public services, that is absolutely fundamental, that we have a stormwater system that will be resilient, both in terms of our existing issues and future impacts of climate change.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just hung around to make sure that you knew the city was out there and that we would very much support the idea of moving forward with asking the property owners to add this as a fee to their property related fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for your comments and for your good work. Okay. We were starting to have council discussions, so we have options. Well, first of all, is there a sense of the council that this is something important that we want to move forward on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will just hasten to add that the paragraph on page seven that says To meet the challenge of sea level rise, rising groundwater and more frequent and intense storms, the city's funding of its stormwater pumps, etc., etc., must be commensurate with its maintenance, operations and capital needs by increasing revenue to get closer to the stormwater systems, current'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and projected needs. This action is one of the most important near-term actions recommended in the city's draft Climate Action and Resiliency Plan. Your thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilmember Odie Sure. I'll go first. Things were serious. Thanks, Leon, for this report. And I had some questions the first time you brought this, but they were all answered. And I appreciate the survey that that gave me a lot of information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, my history of dealing with polls, although they're not like the election, they're pretty accurate. So it's comforting to know that, you know, even at the higher end, which I'd be more inclined to go at the higher end that we're still above above 50%.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm perfectly comfortable moving forward with this and thanks, Ruth, for spending some time with me and talking more about it. I would like us to have a backup plan because there is a disparity between, you know, the 67% that would approve and, you know, the 53.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it makes me feel like we could win a parcel tax. I'd rather not do that unless we have to. But it'd be great to have a backup plan just in case. I mean, I'm crossing my fingers and will be.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, that's all I'll say that that it passes because as you said the last time you were here, this fund is pretty much depleted. And we just did a climate emergency thing a few months ago and we just did the Climate Action Plan earlier today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So, again, we can't just put that on the shelf. We have to we have to actually act based on those decisions we made. And I think this is the first step we can take. While second, if you count veterans court in in implementing what you've asked us to implement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Really, who else? Councilmember Vice mayor and we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All second everything Councilmember Ody has said. And I think he makes a compelling argument for why we should ask for the if we if we feel comfortable. And I think that survey data doesn't show a significant drop from the low end to the high end of the of this, that if we're going to be serious about our'",
        "'speaker_6': 'climate, we are going to have to pay for these projects. Then you want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To make a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Motion.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I will move approval moving forward with a recommendation for $78. Second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any comment? I mean, any discussion? Yeah, we. Yes, discussion. Yeah. I guess somebody said.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Real quickly when I looked at these survey respondents, it looked like there was like 250 response out of roughly almost 2900. So usually I think around you want 600 responses in order to get 90 or 95% certainty. So it's not just the margin of error, but you also want I get that you're 95% sure that that the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'probable finding falls within the mean and the margin error. But you need 600 usually I think is the number. But so your so your your number is probably not 90% or 95% is probably 80% or 85%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That might have been a little confusing in the staff report. The the surveys were mailed to nearly 12,000 people. And as this slide shows, we had 2200 responses received so many more than 200. I think what you're referring to is that we looked at just the universe of tenants who were registered voters, and in that we had'",
        "'speaker_7': 'a lower response rate and a higher margin of error. But for the survey results on these slides, those had margins of error of about 3%, which actually better than some of the polls the city has been involved in over the past few years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Well, if you're if you're surveying 2000, and that's a good number came in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you mailed almost 12,000 surveys, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So just just by way of background, when when the census does their asks, they're surveying 400 households and that's based upon 400 households providing. So it's pretty amazing. But I am concerned about $78. I would prefer the smaller $45 and I get the permeable surface thing, but I'm always hung up with the fact that, you know, the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'apartments over there, what are they called now, summer home or whatever they're called. I mean, they only pay $289 for that one whole parcel. They only pay $289 towards the hospital tax and I pay $289 towards the hospital tax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's unfair because Summer House has 500 units or whatever. And so that's piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So would you rather have them pay $36 a year?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, I would rather have them pay an amount that would be pro-rata equivalent to what I have to pay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's that's not good for us because. Yeah. And there's a reason that it has to be this configuration. Okay. Anything further? Okay. We have a motion to move forward with. Councilman Ravello.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just want to say, moving forward, this, at least from my perspective, because there was a statement made that the people have spoken and it still just rubs me the wrong way. But moving forward this and I'm in support of the higher fee and putting it forward to towards a vote using this this option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that in no way means or should diminish the fact that everybody, regardless of whether or not they own property, are a voter that matters or a constituent for that matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At least in my. I would agree with that. All right. We've had a motion seconded on favor I opposed. Okay. So that motion carries 4 to 1. Thank you. Thank you very much. Okay. We are going to speed do one last item and that is a6e.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Public hearing to consider. Introduction of ordinance amending Alameda Municipal Code Section 30 dash to be zoning regulations to define animal shelter and Section 30 Dash 410 Zoning regulations to add animal shelter and supervise outdoor animal runs as uses requiring a use permit within the sea and commercial manufacturing zoning district council.'"
