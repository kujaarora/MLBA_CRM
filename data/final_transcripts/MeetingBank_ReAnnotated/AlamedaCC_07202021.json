        "'speaker_3': 'considering. We were also attempting to provide options sprinkled throughout the city of Alameda in order to be equitable. Possible sites described in our staff reporting. The Alameda point and its courts. The bottled parcel grant pavilion. Parking lot. Alameda Point Campgrounds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parking lot. The Marina village. And then the locations of future potential homes. Staff is taking direction from Councilor Knight in the following ways regarding the type of homeless housing that City Council prefers that we further investigate if staff should pursue one type of homeless housing in the short run or another, and another type in the long run'",
        "'speaker_3': 'locations that the Council prefers of this housing be located or located because the Council prefers that we not further investigate. We wish to stress that this staff report is very preliminary and only offers a high level look at some of these options.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We anticipate that this conversation with council that we're beginning tonight will be the first of a number of conversations related to this very important topic, and it will take significant effort to house our unhoused neighbors. So we will be talking with you further about this as we develop additional facts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what we wanted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To be sure that prior to investing the city's resources, whether those be monetary or staff time, that we come forward to have this initial conversation and seek your direction about which type of housing seems the most preferable to you, whether it's two types.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like I said, that we can pursue one currently and one subsequently knowing that it's a bigger left and will take more money with council direction. Following that follow and receiving that tonight, we'll do a deeper dove into a particular housing type.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For instance, will then consider the cost to construct the project or repair or remodel a project. The operating budget for the Park Project funding and finance opportunities whether those the ARPA project ROOMKEY grants, tax credit deals, loans, vouchers, etc. a project schedule development partner and operating partner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The population to be served the best site for the particular project and various other factors that I'm sure we'll discover as we continue down this journey. We anticipate returning to council to provide more specificity on the project as we develop those facts that for Council's consideration, staff currently recommends that we pursue, in the short run, a community'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cabin project that would offer approximately 20 cabins, including 88 cabins and and staff space and community space. We represent we recommend providing a higher quality cabin such as the group Delphi or the Pallet Option. We could provide bathrooms depending on council's preference and we would also provide community spaces for queer folks can gather and get to know'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one another, enjoy meals, potentially gardened or potentially have pets so they can exercise. So at this point, I welcome I'll open this up to your questions and your comments, and I look forward to hearing more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we will thank you, miss back. So we will entertain any questions about the staff report itself. We will hold our comments until we have heard from our public speakers and we have at least a few public speakers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So any clarifying questions about the staff report counts from a desk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In terms of the pallet approach, how does.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How does that affect system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Work? I mean, you know, it can get cold out at Alameda Point at nighttime. I mean, how does.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The heaters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Work? I mean, so it's like any other house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So the pallet this is lots butler. For the record, the pallet option would have heating and air conditioning as part of the unit and it would need to get connected to the utility systems.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Any other clarifying questions? Counsel for her, Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mary. I'd like you to discuss the funding sources for these different projects. And why didn't you bring back a bigger discussion of where you're going to get so much money or have access to so much for ARPA, so much for this homekey and what are the different projects?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As well as working with the Alameda Housing Authority, which had presented some ideas back in March and I don't see any of their is being considered.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the funding sources, we still need to do further investigation. And some of the responses that I would wish I could provide to at this point, such as ARPA funds that we have available and potential project HOMEKEY funds where available are that that information isn't determined yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're you as a councilor discussing ARPA this evening and maybe you'll choose to allocate some of the funds in this direction. Project Homekey is still also a developing topic. We understand we won't even have the opportunity to submit an application into the fall.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We estimate we could potentially be eligible for $10 million for a larger project, but that is our best guess. And the rules related to those that that particular fund aren't even finalized yet. But like I mentioned, otherwise we'll explore all sources.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, if we can apply for grants, if there's loan opportunities, tax credit deals, we will definitely turn over all the stones. But we'll need to return back to you to discuss the package of options that we're considering and get your input on those in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We'd also be talking to the housing authority in particular. We are interested in seeing if there's some sort of an arrangement to be made with respect to affordable housing vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hey. Anything further?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So Councilmember Knox Slate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. I'm wonder if you could speak really quickly about how you're thinking about locations and what makes a successful location. And one of the reasons I'm asked, you know, often there is let's just put it out at the end of the base, but the base doesn't have transit services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of a lot of things sometimes depend where it goes. So as we're thinking through, you know, sites and whatnot, how is staff thinking about that? Which sites would be what would make a successful site?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're correct. There's a variety of elements and items that we need to consider with respect to each site. But yes, access to services such as grocery or other sorts of local amenities are important and transit line access. This is a consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We certainly are going to need to have a robust conversation with the community and the neighbors and, you know, make sure that we can have a and a comfortable relationship among the various uses, for instance, that with respect to bottled water.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we would be having conversations with the local residents as well as the College of Alameda, since we would have adjacency there and there would be a constant consideration because we need to be able to successfully implement this project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There would be operating costs, long term cost that we would need to come up with year after year to consider utilities. It's a very multifaceted consideration of considerations that we'll be discussing with you as we put the pros and cons of each site together in more detail to the extent you direct us to look at a particular'",
        "'speaker_3': 'site. Also, as I mentioned, equity, like trying not to place all particular services such as homeless provision services on Alameda Point where they are currently and just trying to look at a little more broadly than that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Miss Factor. Thank you. Thank you, counselor. Next week. Okay, good questions, everyone. So I'm not seeing any more council questions. So, Madam Clerk, I think we have public speech. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we do. We have eight. Oh, there's more reason there. We have nine public speakers, so the chime automatically lowers to 2 minutes. And so our first public speaker is Nancy Schmidt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Good evening. Speaker Simek.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Thank you all for your service. Very much appreciated. And also, I wanted to thank Lisa and Lois, if you were the ones developing the spending plan, perhaps along with a city manager. The proposals are really clear, and I appreciate all the information you're sharing with the public.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did want to ask a couple of questions and hopefully they'll get answered in more discussion. And one is what role does the city of Alameda have in the larger regional approach to homelessness? This is not an approach that just is within our city boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we know it is as people are pushed from one location, they move to another. And this is something that we need to look at much more broadly than just our city issues. I wanted to know what kinds of involvement there is there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The second is my concern, particularly looking at the hotel acquisition and the hotel operation in, I believe, close to $28 million till 2026, recognizing that the homeless unhoused issue will continue way beyond that. And I appreciate Lisa's comments about what can we do beyond that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My big concern is the costs, particularly for hotel operation, is very costly and it won't be reduced. And it looks like from then on, that general fund would be required to pitch in. So I'm just curious about kind of beyond the 2026.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're kind of almost in 2022. So I'm feeling like, you know, four short years from now, we'll be kind of hanging. And I just keep in mind that the Marina Village and residents were cut off on January 31st and without much ramp down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for your comments. Our next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker, Sherry Johansen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Johansen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. And council and staff. I am actually speaking tonight with the voice of the Alameda progressives. We commend the city staff for the proposals and success. However, we believe the marina in transformation is the most viable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is a logical.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Extension of its use during the COVID.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Crisis. We urge Council to approve the necessary expenditures to convert the marina and to a permanent facility. We strongly recommend that this facility or the approved facilities include a resiliency center, a sort of batsman of services and information, a resiliency center where both residents and members of the Alameda Public have access to counseling for transitioning from the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'streets or from the crisis to continue as viable members of the Alameda Committee. It's suggested resources would include in the center would be financial assistance, as well as banking and financial.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Management behavior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And physical health services, transportation, legal services, nutrition and food access. The center would provide showers and laundry facilities. The Senate, without to avail itself of resources and volunteers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the Alameda community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The faith based business and public. And we hope that the council will provide space for community gardens at all the suggested locations. In this time of crisis, thousands of our neighbors are about one disaster.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Paycheck.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Away from losing their home. Many of these are single mothers with children. Many are elderly. The heart of Alameda on both sides of grand has always been compassion. The Alameda Progressive urged you at this moment in time and opportunity to take this step towards eliminating homelessness in our community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker Johansen our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Grover Wyman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Women Brown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, council members. Thanks to the city staff for putting together these off these options, they are you know, they give many options to the community and they're well considered as a long time advocate for affordable housing. Who myself was unhoused as a young person.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I, I wish that we actually could just do all these things because that's actually what's needed to address the scale of the problem. But given these options and the resources we have in Alameda and the resources that are available from the state government for a very rare opportunity, I'm I'm calling to support the Marina Village in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'project project Roomkey. As the previous speaker mentioned, was the short term project. And unfortunately, people were asked to leave that that hotel lodging quickly. My hope was that the city would have been selected to leverage it to project Homekey, which is a really unique opportunity to take that that building that already exists, that's already connected to plumbing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and water, and let it be a temporary and transitional home for people as they get on their feet. And our need to end homelessness is both urgent and long term. It's going to keep going. And so I hope that the city uses these funds, pairs it with ARPA, project, homekey and the things that are available to invest'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in something durable, not something short term that could easily catch fire, that needs to be connected to water and sewage. And that isn't a place that people can feel like they really belong in community. Marina Village is close to grocery stores and transit, and it's in the center of the island, allowing people to more easily integrate, find'",
        "'speaker_0': 'jobs, connect with friends and family. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Marilyn Rothman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Rothman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. Oops. Hello. I just want to second what the last speaker has said. I feel like it would be very valuable to use the Marina Village Insight as it's, you know, pretty much ready to go as far as starting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ah, are ending a homelessness for people. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Austin Austintown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker tam.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Mayor and City Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Urge you to support the marine band inside. And they second what my colleagues, Jerry and Grover have said. And the speaker. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denise Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I just wanted to call in and support item six a. I really look forward to our city making more of an effort to assist some of our more vulnerable neighbors. I think all of these are a step in the right direction, but feel more in a village in May be the best way to get people'",
        "'speaker_0': 'into sheltering the most expediently. I saw a lot of concerns from people about an increase in crime in the correspondence, but this is a lot of the same NIMBY argument that we hear on so many issues in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We need to invest in everyone's safety, not just some people's. And that means getting them into housing and helping them with the services to find and maintain more permanent housing in their.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speaker, Lauren, myself.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Eisele. But welcome back, Chi Chi. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Marion. City Council Members. Thank you for my comments. As a member of the village community, we have worked with Project in the past, in the past to make their residents at the Marina Village in a win win situation when they were here during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we welcome a positive opportunity for housing the homeless in Alameda in the future. However, I would really, really recommend that whatever reuse that happens, whether it's at the Marina Village in other places in the city that we consider all of the other auxiliary issues that come along with housing, unhoused people related to their health and security'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and safety and in particular fire hazards. We all know that there have been lots of fire hazards in our community and and making sure that we are all safe from fires. Their number one concern and in our in our community so just considering.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That and the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Safety and the welfare of all the residents, this is something that we would be very much interested in considering and also taking into consideration other issues related to safety and security of the nearby residents as well as residents that we're considering.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing is something that we also need to consider. So before the city decides to authorize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And your time is up. Thank you so much. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Josh Guyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Speaker Guyer Good evening, American Living Vice Mayor and other City Council members. So I am a member of Renewed Hope here in Alameda. I think the best project like other folks have said, the best individual project is the acquisition of Marina Village.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's doubtlessly the fastest way to get the most units online as possible. It's a great site. It's near a lot of different commercial activities, job opportunities and transit it all over and a lot of other amenities. It's a great site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My druthers would be as to just echo Grover Wayman Brown. All of the above. There can never be enough new housing in Alameda. We need it desperately, desperately, both for people who are here and people who are here already.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People have been forced out and other people who would like to join us in our community. I the only other thing I would say is I'm looking at housing type one here from the pallet shelter, something that kind of jumped out at me as a red flag is that the shelters intentionally do not have restrooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a part of the company's philosophy, and they believe that helps give residents a reason to leave their cabin and socialize. I think having an inn unit bathroom is like really about human dignity in a lot of instances, especially to people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For people who have not had privacy in some amount of time. I think it's a it's a it's a huge deal. And I think it's pretty paternalistic to for this company to to assert that that they know best and they should be depriving people of having a private bathroom in order to to, like, coerce them into meeting'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I'm sure they will get out. The weather's beautiful here. I'm sure there will be a service realizing as much as they need to. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Margaret Thatcher.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcomes speaker question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Hi, can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can hear you. Welcome. Yes. Do you want to tell us who you're with, by the way? Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor and council members. I guess I'm an echo.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We hear you sound defined from our side, Marguerite, but I know that can be annoying. And we're not going to time you till you start talking. Oh, and you're muted now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I'm so sorry. I wanted to thank the staff for putting this together. I think it's really great to start the conversation. This is definitely a moment in time that we can take advantage of the opportunities of the statewide funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We were up. I'm from Operation Dignity and we do that. So we do the transitional housing for veterans on the base, and we also do mobile outreach for the city of Alameda. We know that the long term unhoused residents of Alameda really deserve to have a safe and secure place to live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when looking at all these options, I would really encourage you to consider thinking about not only the marina village in, but also either modular or prefab. Those are all eligible under Project HOMEKEY And you want to think about if you're inheriting a lot of problems potentially with a with an existing facility that hasn't been updated or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'upgraded in a long time as opposed to modular housing, which can be built offsite. It's not expensive, but you can bring in plumbing. It's all put together somewhere else and then it comes in. You have plummeted electrical and you can stack it so you could really house the folks that you need to house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would encourage you to really look at all the opportunities to think about what makes sense for the city of Alameda. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And I'm just going to put in a little plug in addition to being a very hardworking staff person at director at Operation Dignity and as Rashan has been a member of my mayor's vaccine task force doing amazing work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Laura Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening, Speaker Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now you can hear me right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There you go. Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Well, thanks. Thanks for letting me speak. Good evening, everybody. I don't want to. I'm from Renewed Hope housing advocates. And I don't want to take up too much time because the other people have spoken of I pretty much second what most of the speakers have said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do want to say that the the motel the motel purchase is a good idea because the idea of supporting permanent housing as opposed to transitional housing, I think is something the city has to take very seriously, because basically a lot of people that are out there that are unhoused, as we call them now, are people who'",
        "'speaker_3': 'once had homes and the result of rising rents and other problems of forced move out of their homes onto the street. And so transitional housing works, I guess, primarily for people who may have been long term homeless. And I'm sure there's plenty of those people we wish to help and they need the services and everything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But transitional homeless transitional projects always mean that you're trying to get somebody into permanent housing. And permanent housing is really the challenge is trying to give people where they have stable housing. And so I think the motel is the best option.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And has Sherrie Johanson pointed out, people are one step away from a paycheck. So again, people who have had homes have been forced out. They know how to take care of themselves if they have a roof over their head that's stable.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's what the city is to start to focus on, is how do we create permanent housing for the people we need, the people we actually rely upon. Often people who are low wage workers are the most vulnerable and the people we need to really provide this housing for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I thank you for this for this option, and I hope you go forward with it. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Friend, Pauline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Pauline. Are you able to admit there? Monica. There you are. We can hear you. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry, I'm. I'm also speaking in support of purchasing the marina village and for transitional housing. Actually, let me say again. Hello, Mayor. Council and your hard working staff. Once again, I want to thank you for recognizing and acting on the need for affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is a situation further worsened by COVID. I think the decision to have a more permanent transitional housing location is smart. I think stabilizing people earlier in the crisis is far more effective than watching a very predictable downward spiral.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Additionally, as a senior on fixed income and facing my own stress and housing insecurity, I truly appreciate your plan for a mental health center at Alameda Hospital for respite and resources before someone needs police intervention or hospitalization along the same line.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to speak on the need for a resiliency hub located in Central Alameda as a member of our. I've spoken to too many renters who did not learn the relevant information and resources early enough to use it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Online listings alone are not really working. People are being displaced without being counted, without receiving aid that would have been available to them. I believe strongly that a staffed One-Stop Center would make a real difference. Finally, I wish to encourage consideration of land trust purchases of rental complexes that tenants could ultimately own and truly stabilize their housing'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Again, thank you for not just acknowledging me, but acting to find and put in place solutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Zack BOLLING. And then we have one more speaker after that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Good evening, Speaker BOLLING.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just wanted to quickly throw my support in also for the Marina Village and project. And I'm not going to take up too much time since everybody else has already made a lot of great points that I was going to hopefully make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But thankfully, everyone else has done it. So just trying my. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Linda Fortuna.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker fortuna. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I wasn't planning on speaking tonight, but after hearing all of these comments, I. I think I need to say something to protect the citizens of Alameda and to sort of give my opinion of being a property owner for many years in rehabbing and rehabilitating old buildings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The marina village in is not new. We all know that the cost of retrofitting it will probably not make sense for this project. I think that the modular housing is is the best solution because you can use solar technology for each modular house or cabin and you'll be you have no gas, no grid.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No. It'll be a more efficient way of housing these homeless individuals. And I think that the homeless need more social help. They need rehab. And that is the most important thing that we can offer them also. So a combination of that and modular housing, I think would be a good solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I oppose the marina village in as a homeless center right on the waterfront, which is and should be used for the public. And and that way it's shared by all. Alameda. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, speaker, for today. And our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One more speaker. Kristen van gumble.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Fun.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Van Gumble. Well, good evening. Thank you, everyone. We just my husband and I, we just wanted to second everything that Rosalind just said. And we agree the cost is going to be too much for the Marina Village and strongly urge you to consider the modular housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was our final speaker. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that, I am closing public comment on item six A and we will return to the council. I'd like to start.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I'll start.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Kazak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you very much. You know, having reviewed the staff packet and analyzed the situation, I'm of the opinion that in the marina village in we have a rare opportunity to do something fantastic. And let me say why.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Above all, who are trying to serve our families, particularly single woman headed families with children who are coming out of homelessness in a variety of crisis situations. When you look at the Marina Village in and its proximity to the west, to the Shoreline Park, its proximity to the east of Wind River Park and to the south in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a straight line down triumph drive to the Jean Sweeney Park, as well as the breadth of shoreline around the area. You find an environment that I believe will be conducive to families who are transitioning out of area, a place of crises so that the children can hopefully not only recover but achieve the full capacity that we expect'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of any children, whether they're children of homeless families or children of families in the foreign side or in the west end of Alameda. So this is a rare opportunity. There is no doubt that it will cost more. But I think in the long run it would be a better facility than a modular house or it would be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a better facility than pallets. So I think that we should not miss this opportunity to do something bold. So I think, you know, the environment is definitely conducive to that, to families and helping them make a recovery. But as indicated, there are other elements that also make this location really ideal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's proximity to the job. Rich Marina, Village Business Park. You know, as a as a city council, I would encourage our city staff to figure out ways to work with businesses there to to get families and individuals into jobs there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's proximity to Lucky is proximity to a CVS pharmacy and above all, its proximity to a range of transits. There's the marina village shell shuttle. I don't know if it's still running right now, pandemic time, but there's the marina village shuttle, which is free and it goes directly to downtown San Francisco, downtown Oakland, stopping at the BART'",
        "'speaker_2': 'station. There's the city of Alameda is when it's up and running again. Our own internal shuttle, by the way, which goes right by there. And finally, there's the AC Transit bus that we had rerouted to go through that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I do think that the wealth of natural and social amenities makes the marina village in an ideal place to to to have this facility. Yes, it will cost money. And yes, we as a city council, we will have to do our due diligence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if it's going to come in as too expensive, then, you know, then we'll have to think about, you know, what to do. And when that when we're asked to cross that bridge. But if you're asking me if staff is asking me, looking at all the things that's kind of laid out for us, you know, what?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we should do. I'm of the opinion that that we should move forward with with the marina village in. I just want to say on a final note, you know, so much of our community have always come to the attention of trying to help out families in need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know for many years ago it started out with the United Filipinos of Alameda, then transitioned to the Filipino, the Alameda Community Service Agency fixer, where we ran a shelter for for homeless women coming out coming out of a crisis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so, you know, it's part of our DNA to be helpful. And I think that that if we're going to do something, let's do it in a place that's really going to help transition people to to to to going can help transition people out of crises.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think in the marina village and that's what I see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Counselor de Desert. Wow. Thank you. Who wants to go next? I am happy to go next. Councilmember De Saag. I see you and I see eye to eye. I was really moved by your comments. One of the things that I have learned from working on housing issues and in, you know, statewide and in the Greater'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bay Area is that there is a serious shortage of housing that is appropriate and eligible for families because there are restrictions. For instance, when staff and I took a field trip down to San Jose a couple months ago and saw some really exciting modular development that the city of San Jose is doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Those were for adults who could have either one adult or maximum two in a unit with it in a bedroom with its own bathroom. And. Josh Guyer. I second everything you said about pallet homes, rather flimsy argument for no bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll get to that in a minute. But one of the things San Jose was excited about as they were building the first ever family shelter or family transitional housing, it wasn't done yet, so we couldn't go visit it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But here in Alameda and we certainly don't have something like that, we have, you know, Midway Shelter. It's emergency housing. But I do think that the marina village in Prevent presents so many opportunities. Is there a cost to rehabbing it?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, there is. What value do you place on giving children and families a good place, a safe, healthy place to grow up? I appreciate the residents of Marina Village, the neighbors who spoke I spoke earlier in the evening yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had a conversation with one of them. And they you know, we talked about when Marina Village in was used as a project roomkey home for women and children who were homeless and needed to be have a safe place to stay during COVID.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there you know, there were some bumps in the road at first. There always was with changes. But I really applaud the neighbors. I applaud city staff who worked with the county staff, folks from building futures, who who all work together to make sure that it was a living environment that was respectful of everyone, the folks who'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lived there, but also the neighbors. And it was very moving to attend a town hall organized by our supervisor, Wilma Chan, to hear from the neighbors who by then had been working and getting to know the situation and better.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they were so supportive, wanted to know what can we do? Making donations, collecting supplies, wanted to host a holiday party. Did the kids need tutoring? And just really heartwarming response. But it is also true that we need to, you know, will need to do communication and make sure that everyone is is on board.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I do think for all the reasons that have been stated, that this is something the city should definitely pursue, look into, and there are as mismatched. So know that there are multiple funding sources coming down the pike right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we really do need to seize this opportunity. It doesn't come around very often, and I think we can really make a difference in people's lives as far as housing types. I am partial to the model that was presented by Delphi, in part because it is a local company out at Alameda Point, which I think is great'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And the. I also will say that I was not a fan of the argument by pallet homes that that said need to find it in my know my notes here that they because pallets model does happen to be just a small structure with no bathroom community bathrooms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will tell you that the community bathroom model is a just favored model now even before COVID, but especially during COVID for health reasons, but even before that, that it just leads to unnecessary conflicts. And is Mr. Geier, one of our speakers, very eloquently stated this is about human dignity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we visited and walk through these two different sites in San Jose, people were so just pleased and relaxed to be there, to have a place where they could sleep inside. Not sleep with one eye open because they were worried about what would happen, not had to get up and leave, go walk someplace to use the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bathroom, walk outdoors to use the bathroom, but, you know, do the things that you and I do. We don't have to go out unless we're camping. We don't have to be going outside to find the facilities. And so there are better places to socialize than than a restroom.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, in fact, these developments would be set up to have a place to do laundry, to access services like the the the counseling and the resources and whatnot, to have a garden, a community garden, even a dog run, because pets are generally allowed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as far as locations, I, I think that the well again Marina village and I think we can do more than one thing I think the marina village in is definitely an attractive option but also I think the bottle parcel over near the College of Alameda is close to amenities and would be a good location.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I to second what Miss Maxwell said earlier about equity. We are not just saying, okay, let's put all of our homeless resources at Alameda Point. So again, staff, I want to thank you for bringing all these options to us, really doing a great survey and bringing them to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm really excited to see these funding opportunities that are coming. Let's seize the moment. We came really close. We were on the short list to get funding to transition the marina village in from a Project Roomkey to Project Homekey.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we just didn't get off the waitlist before those funds ran out. So I know that the county certainly thought it was a good project. Anyway, that's all from me. And who wants to go next? Vice Mayor. That's mayor of L.A..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to try to keep my comments really brief. I cosign what has been said by my two colleagues. I really think that the guiding principles here. Well, first of all, we know that there is a significant need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also know that this need is not going to go away any time soon. I'm very much interested in finding opportunities for permanent a permanent, affordable and permanent transitional housing. Just because folks are in a state of transition does not mean that the units themselves need to be transitional.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really want to second the comments that were made by Councilmember de SOG and Mayor Ashcroft. I think when we talk about housing, we really need to lead with the value of empathy. We need to lead with the value of making sure that we are addressing the human dignity aspect of things and providing and providing a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'home. And that is to say, I do not like the pallet suggestion. I think that there are options. I think that there are a number of issues that have been addressed by my colleagues that I also find to be of concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, you know, I very much support pursuing Marina Village, and I think that there's a huge opportunity for us there. But I also want to just say that I think that this is a yes and conversation. I think this is yes, we need to do Marina Village.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we also need to find and be looking for opportunities. We know what the numbers are. We we've heard the reports. We know that there is a significant need for transitional housing. So this is not going to be enough.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We know. We know that. So I think we always need to be on the lookout for other opportunities for sites where we can either build permanent affordable housing or build permanent transitional housing. And that's really what I want to see, because these needs are not going to go away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In terms of who's going to administer it and how that's going to be going, I'll be looking forward to the staff report. I think that there are a number of different options out there. I think we need to look at that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do think that there is a difference between permanent affordable housing and providing the services needed to operate a temporary or transitional housing site. And so I want to see that fleshed out a little more in terms of what that will look like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I'm very much supportive of moving forward with Marina Village in and as well as other options. I did like. I do like the idea of modular. I think that there are some limitations with it. And as the mayor noted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you Vice Mayor Vella and I did also under when we talk about homeless families who are experiencing homelessness. I heard recently from someone with us that there are at least 57 children in the Unified School District who are from homeless families.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we're thinking of them to council members. Spencer Herrera, Spencer, let's hear from you there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate the comments of the callers as well as my fellow council members. I am concerned that back in March, the Housing Authority came up with some suggestions of using stimulus funds that would also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Make it so that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing was available quickly. For instance, they could purchase 18 very low and low income homes for very low and low income families. They could bid competitively on a purchased land disposition from a U.S. that could house 30 affordable family apartments they had on this list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They could use 8 million to expedite the first two phases of federal funding for the housing authorities. North Housing Development, which includes units of mixed supportive housing for homeless senior and family housing. They could buy existing units or restrict them to at least 80% of the area median income.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They could also they said that for every $10 million, they could generate nearly 30 units of the rent restricted apartments. So I think it's important that staff, city staff work with the housing authority and see what are the viable options.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The comments that the Bring a village in is so important that we need to just disregard the cost. I'm very concerned about I think the focus has to be that we do in fact have limited funds. And what is the best way to spend this money to meet the needs of the unsheltered?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do prefer permanent housing rather than the temporary relief. She made the comments of not supporting not having bathrooms in housing units. I don't think that that is appropriate in regards to the other sites that some of these proposed sites, for instance, the marina village in as well as the Grand Pavilion, have brought revenue to the city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'over the years. When this comes back, I'd like to see what is the tax, for instance, the transit occupancy tax, any revenues that the city has made in the last five years, pre-COVID, so that we can have the analysis of what revenue stream we would then be using if we're converting these to housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then any estimate of the upgrading the facilities. I think that we really do have to look at the total cost as well as what the cost would be to purchase. But I think we should really keep our options open broader at this time to acquire, get more information working with the Housing Authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another issue I'm concerned about is that this covenant, 55 year covenant. What that really means and I would like that language to be more specific when it comes back to the public understands is that the people that end up operating it then after 55 years could actually end up owning the property and then they flip it to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'market rates. So it's not long term affordable housing. So I think it's real important that recraft these documents so that they end up being owned by the city or the housing authority long term for the benefit of sheltering those with low income and that they do not eventually become market rate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm very concerned about that happening. That's a real serious issue. So I would like those all of this to be better vetted. But I really want the city staff to work more collaboratively with the housing authority and to make sure that we're getting the most housing for the dollars and not be so narrow in our focus at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this time. And then I also want to look at other uses of this money, because there have been suggestions that the universal basic income, for instance, and I would like to be able to see how.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It comes out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Piecemeal with these monies. I would like to continue. Please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's the next item that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can speak in regards to the money on this that I'm concerned with any any other uses of the money to make sure that we're not eliminating our narrowing our options probably at this time, ARPA monies could be used for multiple things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do want to look at our other all of our options. Some people had suggested the support services and locations and all of that and distance. That's critical. So for instance, this auto parcel is near the college and that's a lot of benefit for services that's already there and to Maxima and also close to James Rainey'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Park. And they will be having community gardens and that's one of the common areas of public comment. I spoke about that. So when we're looking at sites, I think it is important then member Knox. So I have brought up and I agree some of the sites out at the base, public transportation is really hard, is not there'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at all. So I'm not sure that those are really viable locations. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And in my conversations with staff, I understand that they certainly have reached out to the housing authority and they are just waiting for a little more concrete proposals. But there is nothing that stops the housing authority from using their funds, certainly to purchase buildings to address our housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Knox, why did you want to wait?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't have much more to add, I think. Yeah, it sounds like we're heading pretty strongly toward some form of. Yes. And I guess my one concern is, you know, well, I think arguments for both the marina village in and the battle parcel are very good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want us to maybe double down in thinking about where else we can be. Look for sites. You know, I will throw out my perennial solo shot of we have a large building across the street from city hall that has been vacant for the 20 years I have lived in this city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We continue to wait to find something to do with it. And I do think that housing and homelessness are two of our biggest priorities. And I do think that we should consider whether the Carnegie has a role to play in this at this point in time, especially with this much money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, you know, I would like that at least on the table. It may be too expensive. It may not work because of. Etc.. But, you know, we keep trying and we keep not finding a use for it at certain point in time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've got to do something. But but I definitely agree that we need to go big. I want to make sure that before we go too far down the road with Marina Village in that there is public engagement very early because I know that it is causing a lot of stress from folks who have inhabit that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I also think that a lot of the folks I'm talking to also understand that it doesn't matter what neighborhood you're going to suggest for, for this type of housing, that that neighborhood is going to raise concerns. And I've heard from a lot of very open, reasonable people who just want to hear that the city is considering'",
        "'speaker_2': 'their concerns and working with them to to address them. And so I think, you know, we're out there early. We can do that, you know. But again, I think that when that when these items come back, what I would I would like is I know that the county has done a lot of work thinking about who we'",
        "'speaker_2': 'need to help, where we need to help, etc.. I'd like to hear a little bit about where that where the needs that the county is identifying for for our not just city but region as well. So that, you know, we are making sure that we're moving forward with services and housing for the folks who are kind of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at the at the greatest need as well, and not unintentionally picking and choosing winners and losers based on, you know. Characteristics that might not be where the greatest need is. So I think thinking about how we're feeling in the cities kind of spectrum of services and housing options, I think will be very helpful in just understanding how'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we're how we're moving forward. But I definitely think that the more that we can do some form of both transitional and looking at a larger permanent project like the Marina Village and or something else of that, if that's not the one that works, I would be fully supportive of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exploring next week, Councilor RIDDIFORD.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh. I just want to make sure to say that. Just. Just a form of a correction. I, I did not say, quote, that we will disregard cost. What I did say was that, Marina, whatever we do at Marina Village will probably be expensive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But that, you know, we will have to analyze, you know, the data and the cost information that the staff make brings forward. I think I said something to that effect and determine if that makes sense. But I did not say that we will disregard cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just want to make sure to clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for that. And good points raised by all of you. But Councilmember, not quite to your last point. We did hear from San Jose City staff when we did the walkthroughs of these two developments in San Jose that it took a lot of outreach with the neighbors and and it's a combination of their security provided there'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But there has to be that constant outreach and communication and ahead of time. And but again, I think the groundwork was laid when Marina Village in was a Project Roomkey Hotel. So hopefully we can build on if this ends up being a site, we could build on that so well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So let's see. Just going back, we're looking for providing direction on constructing or installing temporary shelters, transitional housing and or permanent supportive housing, provide direction on the types of projects to pursue and location staff. Do you feel that you have enough direction from?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is this maximum as Butler looks? Counter weight care counselor Harry Spencer has a handout. Sorry. Say that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mary. I wanted to follow up with regards to a number not quite common in regards to the Carnegie. I, too, would be interested in looking at that, that if that's at all a viable option, it is absolutely centrally located.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think it's a great idea to consider that also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. Back to staff. Would you need more from us and city manager Levitt? Feel free if you want to chime in. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you before the shake of the head. Okay. Miss Maxwell. Miss Butler.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I understand correctly, it sounds as though we should be sort of better assessing the group Delphi opportunity for some transitional housing that could be done in the potential shorter term, but then also do some further financial analysis around the Marina Village in the battle parcel and if there's any other particular sites that lend themselves to something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'comparable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will need to know by far what we're going to apply for through the county. So we'll have to be cognizant of our timing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I sense that we're ready for you to bring it back to us as soon as you can. I really miss. But did you want to add anything?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I was going to summarize similar to what Maxwell summarized.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Well, I think I speak on behalf of the entire city council to thank you profusely for all your hard work on this very important topic. So is this a real opportunity, I think, for us in Alameda to to take action on helping solve a big problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you so much. Okay. At this point Council, we are going to take a ten minute break. We've been at this for more than 2 hours. So it is almost 925. We will come back at 935. So everybody take a break.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Rest your eyes, get a snack, what have you, and we'll see you at 935. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The club. Girl.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I need to talk to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You treat.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's silly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm doing my nose count. Sean's there. There's Tony. So I just don't know if familiar.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Who've you got? Can you tell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Laura? There's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's Chris. Okay, so we're just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seeing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If Melissa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's some ask to start video features that I've asked a couple of people, so hopefully they're getting the notice. We're already in the chambers, we're live, so we're good at any point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Let's see. I'll send a quick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Quick text.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will wait one more minute and then we're going to get started. To try and just know. He just. I never know why that is that people. Relocate to another. Location on the screen. Keeps me guessing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, tell you what, it is just about 940, it's 939. And we did say there is Councilmember Vela. Vice mayor. Vice Mayor. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've got everyone. Are you. But we've got staff. I'm glad everybody took snacking seriously. It's. It's important. So, Miss Speller, is this are you doing this presentation or are we also waiting for Miss Maxwell?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, I think it's nice. Butler. Yes, ma'am. Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you like me to read the title?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just. There she is. Okay. You ready to go, Miss Butler? Yes. All right. Yes, Madam Clerk, would you. So welcome back, everyone. And we are moving on to our next item, native clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': '60 is a recommendation received direction from the City Council regarding uses for a potential homeless housing assistance and prevention grant towards.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And all right. Good evening, Mayor and members of city council. For the record, I'm Lois Butler, Economic Development and Community Services Manager. The county shared information with the city regarding a potential award of homeless housing assistance and prevention grant funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Each HAP funds in the amount of $285,767. In order to prepare to receive this grant, award, staff is requesting direction from City Council. Once the grant funds are available, we will return to City Council with a recommendation that reflects your direction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are several potential uses of the funds, including providing emergency funds for shelter to shelter. The UN has provided mental health emergency support for the unhoused, providing one time emergency assistance to those on the verge of becoming house, supporting community cabins and providing direct assistance to the unhoused who have located housing and have no means to pay'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for but can't afford rent. So they can't afford to pay for the initial move in costs. Staff is recommending the following allocations 125,000 to provide overnight shelter to the day center. This would allow up to ten persons to stay overnight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Customers would be able to use the facilities throughout the day and night, and this would allow the city to house a small number of the city's homeless population until we have longer term shelters for them, and then 75,000 to augment existing street outreach with mental health.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This would enhance street outreach and street based case management with mental health support. These funds would be targeted to the unhoused that need the most, it seems, with that need moderate to extreme mental health services and then finally allocate roughly 86,000 for flexible funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This would provide one time assistance for homeless prevention. The funds would be used for car repair, back rent, utility payments for previously homeless, or those on the verge of becoming homeless. The funds would also support homeless individuals with emergency expenses, such as car repair for those living in vehicles, emergency help motel stays working with the unhoused to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'clear up credit or other related records, such as driving records. If the funding is sufficient to address the mental health needs of the city. If other funding is sufficient, staff recommends that the proposed mental health funding go to the other remaining categories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Increasing the overall. Amount for overnight shelter to 186,000 and the flexible funds to 100,000. Alternatively, the funds could be used to support traditional transitional housing, such as those that were mentioned in the previous report. Based on the City Council's direction, staff will return with a contract for award of the funds after the county has received its funding'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Miss Butler. It's always nice to get fans we weren't anticipating. And that's what we have here. And thank you for your report. And Madam Kirk, do we have public speakers on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We do not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, counsel, it's if we have no public speakers, then I'm going to go ahead. They're going to go ahead and close public comment and we will just launch right into council questions, comments, motion, what have you. So Council, what's your pleasure, Councilmember Herrera Spencer and then Councilmember Knox.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Jack, for this report. I'd like some more information about the all of these items. How, for instance, how did you come up with the ratio? Is there some formula that the reference of the 125,000, if I heard correctly, and I read this correctly, it's ten persons, but I don't know for how'",
        "'speaker_0': 'many nights. And I'd like to actually know what is the cost per night that you're estimating. And then the second one, the Street Outreach, Mental Health. Do we have an organization right now that you're working with that you're extending what is the 75,000 buy and then the last digit, the amount that.'",
        "'speaker_1': '85,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is actually the most broad. That could actually be my preference. And I don't know if you could allocate more money to that. I really like the idea of that includes assistance for car repairs, paying back rent and utilities for previously homeless or those most vulnerable are on the verge of becoming homeless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this to me is actually, if I'm understanding correctly, is the most similar to some sort of universal basic income where we help, we treat people that they know that they how to spend the money work best and can get the most bang out of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that that might actually be my highest priority is where I think it could be most efficient. But so I would like more information of, you know, what is the cost per night for the overnight shelter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think maybe some people can figure it out, maybe lower if we give them more money to spend. Thanks. Okay. So I don't have the cost per night, but I could probably calculate it. I would need to go through my notes for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I do, what I do have is that. And the way we the way that it was figured out was we were trying to have a stopgap measure for a for for shelter. We need a way to put people in shelter temporarily.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It cost about $100 per night to have people in in shelter temporarily. And this would allow us to get some of the most vulnerable off the street. People say that they don't have a place to stay at all, and that's why they're setting up camp in our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We would be able to move them temporarily to a shelter. So I will I will come back to that item. As far as as the other items are concerned, mental health, we do have a provider that we're working with that that does provide mental health services that could tack on to what they are providing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have not negotiated a deal with them, but we we have talked I have talked to them about perhaps having them work with some of our moderate and extreme mental health folks that that that we have in and that are homeless in Alameda that were trying to get in into permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we can't do that because their health condition is such that they can't be trusted in housing at this point. And then with the flexible funds, the amount was based on being able to provide the temporary shelter and the mental health service, and that was the remaining amount.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I will get back to you on the the shelter item. Okay. You have to do a calculation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Councilmember Harris, as you had more questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like to know who that provider is that you're looking that's currently working with the city that you're looking at extending. Um, the, the shelter, the, the case provider would be Operation Dignity. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had a question having to do with mental health assistance, Mr. Butler. Is it possible if we were to augment the amount we're spending on those services now, that we could have someone on call 24 seven for somebody who's just having an episode and looks like they could use some assistance, as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Operation Dignity. I think they do outreach. Outreach, correct. And what you know, what are their what are their what's their structure now? Is it Monday through Friday certain hours? Is it on the weekend?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it's not on the weekend. It's Monday through Friday. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So would there be a possibility of extending to the weekends and maybe the evenings?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could look at doing that with the dollars instead of doing the mental health piece. Are you? Are you? We don't have them doing any mental health. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was confused when you said Operation Dignity. I was. Yeah. So who who would be providing the mental health services?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I would be proposing is operation. Technically, they provide it in other jurisdictions within hours. Got it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do we not currently provide some mental health assistance to our homeless population?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, we only provide case management. Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Okay, so this would actually be something new. We're starting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, then I could see the I could see the the reasoning for starting with a monday through Friday model. But hopefully, perhaps if it's successful, it could be expanded to to longer, because I think we could probably all agree that people that just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have their mental health crises Monday through Friday. Okay, I, I have some other thoughts, but I'd love to hear from the rest of the council council members. Anybody want to add anything or to be like these recommendations? Council member, not quite when it was.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ready to move the staff recommendation. I think they did a great job and I just want to thank them for their work. They moved the staff recommendation. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And did. Okay. Let's have a say and then maybe have a just a little bit more discussion. Council member, they said, are you seconding? Okay, perfect. We've had a motion by council member that's. Wait a second. By councilor would decide the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to. I love everything you proposed. Ms.. Butler and then on the page three where it says if well, it's a carryover from page two, if other funding is sufficient to address the mental illness needs of the city's housed staff recommends that the proposed mental health funding referenced above be divided between and allocated to the'",
        "'speaker_1': 'other two categories, that being increasing the 67,000 plus fortnightly shelter to 185,000 plus, and then increasing the flexible funds from 14,000 some to 100,000. Alternatively, the funds could be used for transitional housing programs such as the community cabins.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I might like to see some of that money going to try to help get those shelters where people could go. That I do think more than 14,000 for flexible funds is a good thing and jumping it all the way up to 100,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's quite a bit. And again, this is only if we find that there's funding coming in to cover the mental health services that Ms.. Butler's proposing. But I. Anybody else have any thoughts about that? Ms.. Butler ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I should say that this cut, the funding cut, can span over a couple of years. It's not just a one year funding amount. And so the the moneys for the flexible funds, which just extend for a longer period of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thank you for that clarification. What period of time are we talking about?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Currently the funding would probably last about a year, just over a year and a half. And if you extended it, it would last approximately two years. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for that clarification. Okay. Councilmember Herrera Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Q In regards to mental health services, I don't know if we've looked in at Almeida Family Services, and I know they provide quite a bit of mental health support to other APEC, I believe, as well as our schools.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And obviously within the community they offer quite a bit of counseling. So I don't know if you checked with them, if they would be eligible to help with any of your ideas. But I, we we could we could extend it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could do an RFP for these services. We don't have to go with the entity that I spoke with. It was just that I spoke with them because they do provide it in other locations. It's my understanding when analysts here she had spoken to Alameda Family Services in the past for services and they they are interested in'",
        "'speaker_0': 'providing services but maybe not of this type. I can go back to them and speak with them about that again. And then APEC, I was not aware that they provided mental health services, so I can also speak with them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Family Services at least provide some mental health services to APC. Sorry if I misspoke. Okay. I really value our services of the different locations within the community already. And I and I this my understanding that they have the capability to do the Weekender 24 seven services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I can I can definitely speak with them. So just this is, you know, something to look into. But regardless of the formula, how is it the bet is that this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This allocation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Really the best use of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The money?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not really sure because I'm not really sure what it's based on. But I, I do like with, you know, flexible funds and letting it can go to a lot of different options. So I just think that so when you're saying the one 2575 and then the 86, is that like at some point it means the city'",
        "'speaker_0': 'gets these means that they could reallocate depending upon what things actually cost and where we actually see the greater need to meet people's needs. Yes. So to answer your first question about the the cost, it would be $1,250 a week, and that would be five, five days a week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just $50 plus the weekends. So it would be seven days a week. And then your second question. I'm sorry, I was doing the calculation to try to get you your information. What was the second question going back to the first one then?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it how many days does. Over a year? It's over a year, 50 to 52 days and ten people. And it's $1,250 a week. Okay. So depending upon if that really is the best uses the program unfolds, I'd like to hope that we can have some flexibility there because I think keeping people in their homes might actually'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be a good use of that tool, which is the flexibility issue option.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anything for the second baseman, Avila. Okay. Vice mayor of L.A..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It just we know that our unhoused population has grown. We have a significant need with the folks that are going to our shelter. We also know that they do not have a place to go at night. And I think that this is a good opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that what we are going to find is that this is insufficient to serve. That need is substantially insufficient. This is not a huge amount of money that we're talking about. I'm very supportive of the staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it is trying to maximize the space that we have at our data center while still addressing with dignity the needs of the folks that we have. So I'm prepared to support the proposal tonight. And I also just think that at the end of the day, I also want to be cognizant of staff time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We are having this staff work on a number of different issues. And so I actually don't support having them try to go back and kind of do work a second time. We keep bringing up Alameda Point or we keep bringing up different vendors relative to the mental health services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have vendors that are already operating in this space and so are providers, I should say. And I think that we need to honor the work that's been done rather than second guessing it and, you know, move forward with this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's going to be other opportunities. This is not something where I think that, you know, an RFP or anything like that is needed. I think it would actually delay providing these services that are very, very much needed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would say I agree with that approach. Anyone else want to add anything before we vote on approving the staff proposal? Remind me. We had a motion by Council member Knox White and it was seconded right. By former SA.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, then. Well, let's take a roll call vote, if we could, please. Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember de SAG. Yes. Herrera. Spencer, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Knox Light. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fella. I mayor as Ashcraft high.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That carries by five eyes. Great. Thank you. And Ms.. Butler, thank you again for all your hard work in following up on this. It is so important we have not had a place in Alameda where every day of the year there is someplace that an and sheltered person could lay down their head and have a roof over'",
        "'speaker_1': 'their head. And so now this is an important first step toward doing that. So thank you so much for all your hard work and we'll look forward to hearing more from you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'All right. So with that, we're going to close. I turn six B and we're moving on to item 60. Madam Kirk, will you introduce that item for us, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Recommendation to assign a portion of the 28.68 million funding from the federal government through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to assist this recovery from the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Who doesn't like talking about money coming into the city, huh? And I see some familiar financial faces. We have our finance director and Anita, we have Jennifer, 12, also from finance. And I think. Do you ladies have a presentation?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I believe you've got a PowerPoint. Is that you, city manager?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I think. Mr. Bowden, are you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm going to try. I'm going to do the presentation, but these folks are critical to the conversation. So we'll tag team the responses and Q&A segment. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anyway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Council members, we have another update for you on the the American Rescue Plan Act funding. We hope that the conversation tonight starts to start to funnel our our priorities into a particular direction. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you. So as you all know, we've got $28.68 million in ARPA funding coming to the city of Alameda on June 17th. We received our first tranche, which is a $14.34 million, and we had City Council direction on this topic back in May.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There were a couple of themes to the meeting in May. One of the things that we took away from that meeting was setting up a framework for us to be able to allocate these funds. So we did set up some guiding principles for council's consideration this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also distilled down the topic from the main meeting into four topic areas supplementing revenue loss. This is general fund revenue. Loss was one of the topic areas. Addressing housing, homelessness and behavioral health matters was another topic area building broadband infrastructure in the community and really investing in that in that key and really underinvested in piece of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'infrastructure in the community was another topic area that came to light. And then finally the household and local small business assistance programing, which which is essentially a bucket at this point. There is no program designed around this like we had with prior funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First, with respect to COVID, COVID response and recovery, the monies are intended to be a response to COVID. So that is a critical, critical theme, underlying theme that needs to be considered throughout the discussion. Next slide. So these are the guiding principles.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are eight of them on the screen. The ones that I guess all I'll I'll call out this this information is all fleshed out a little further in the staff report. But we did want to make sure that we called out the equity lens as a particular item that we're wanted to emphasize with the ARPA dollars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a response to COVID. And COVID did impact certain certain elements in our community, certain folks in our community, more so than others. And so as we look to funding opportunities, this is a way to to ensure that we are spreading those resources a little more generously to areas that were harder hit by the pandemic and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the impacts also that the general fund has taken a hit during COVID, and we did bring in less revenue. And so the idea of being able to top up the general fund, which does provide services across the community, is is a topic area that we wanted to make sure was in there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And finally, the one time expenditures element was a theme that we pulled out as well from the the main the main discussion. This is this is one time money. So anything that we create that creates an ongoing operational cost is going to be something that the city's general fund or other funding sources would have to absorb.'"
    ],
    "Allocation of American Rescue Plan Act Funds for COVID-19 Recovery.": [
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that, we'll say next slide, please, and thank you. The interim final rule is really what guides the the elements that are eligible for the that the spending. There are there are some pretty big buckets there. We did using the interim final rule, using the the guiding principles, using the city council priorities that had been established'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in those kind of general topic areas. We did come up with three recommendations or a recommendation and two alternatives. These are for discussion purposes. We still really are at the early stages. There's time to refine and make changes to this program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Overall, we've heard five as recently as today from the Housing Authority and it's clear that we need to have some additional conversation with that group. The options that have been presented will likely will likely generate they're the kinds of projects that will likely have a blend of funding sources.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I'm mentioning that because the the way that the staff report is structured, it's 100% ARPA funding for each of these topic areas. So for example, the Marina Village project, if we were to move forward with that and it's a little bit of a webbed agenda here this evening with closed session, the prior the prior item'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that was discussed as six a and now this item. But if we were to move forward with the Marina Village Hotel project or motel project and conversion, there would likely be a series of funding sources or a number of funding sources that would develop that project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This report looks at it as if ARPA was 100% of the funding source. So the reason I'm mentioning this is that with any alternative that we or any projects that we move forward with, we're likely to be checking in with council every 3 to 6 months.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As projects firm up and spending starts, we'll be able to better assess the amount of ARPA funding that's remaining on the table. So I'll say next slide and we can talk more about that maybe during the Q&A. So the requests that are in the report total a little over $51 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they're in those kind of four broad topic areas that that I discussed earlier. Next slide. The staff recommendation focused on, I'll call it, spreading the wealth, but spending kind of creating a program that was within the means provided by ARPA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's about $28 million. The first year or two is about $14 million, which is what we have in our first tranche. And this really allowed us to hit the ground running on some of the supportive transitional housing options that are available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was listening loud and clear to the conversation earlier this evening and recognize that this recommendation may need to be adjusted. But that was the rationale behind the staff recommendation. These are properties that the city owned that we had the ability to move on quite quickly and actually start to spend money in the in the next year'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So with that, I'll move on to the alternatives because, well, I think it's important to based on the prior discussion this evening here, those as well. Next slide, please. So we had some housing proposals. These these did look at going all in on housing, including both transitional and hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, with a blend of funding sources, we could likely get the the $28 million of ARPA to go the distance and actually probably even be able to fund other options that are not considered in this option. Next slide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This this is the opposite flip of the switch where we did not focus on housing, but focused on things like broadband, small business support and and creating those kinds of lending hotspots and other technology support for for members of the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It applies the same a similar equity lens. What we learned and saw loud and clear during the pandemic is that not having access to Internet for certain populations was particularly difficult. And it created challenges that that we we likely could have foreseen had we had we predicted the pandemic but are really important to address moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide. So if that this is this is a point in time where we have an opportunity over the next essentially three and a little bit years to to program our ARPA spending. And we have about four and a half to five years to spend these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is our first attempt at identifying some priority projects. There'll be a lot more discussion. We want to be accountable and transparent to the community, so we will be reporting back regularly on how the money is spent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so with that, we'd like to hear counsel's direction and on the guiding principles that are included in the report. And if there's anything else you'd like us to associate with those so we can use those moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then if there are projects that we want to that we want to start to move forward on at this point in time relative to the overall ARPA investment, that would be great. So with that, I'll conclude staff's recommendation and our presentation and we'll move on to questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Bird. Nice report. And madam, click, do we have public speakers on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You do not. Oh, now we have one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, well, we will have any clarifying questions from council, and then we'll hear our public speaker. Or maybe there might be more than one council member next. But if you can say your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you. And thank you for the thorough report. For the revenue loss proposal. Does the current budget that the Council adopt adopted include $8 million in revenue loss, or would that be that would be new funding not not considered in the correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we would bring that back as part of either midyear or mid-cycle update, depending on when the actions occur, when the directions received. Or sooner, if that's if that's possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Okay. Any other clarifying questions before we get our public comment or comments? Okay. Madam Kirk, you're going to call the first speaker or the only speaker when you've got two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right? Three. First is Josh Dyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Dyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can living you. So I am a member of a recent member of a really great group here in Olmedo called Transform Alameda. And we some of us along with us the Alameda Justice Alliance and Renewed Hope and an ARC and other groups have the opportunity to meet with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We appreciate that to talk about your thoughts and our thoughts on how to use these ARPA funds. And we are also glad for the opportunity to share our kind of more developed proposal with you. So I just wanted to for those who had other people who may be listening, what kind of briefly what our ideas are that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'so transform. Alameda believes that the city of Alameda has a once in a generation opportunity here to use its ARPA funds to establish comprehensive, integrated public services that are fundamental. We feel for a safe, healthy and thriving community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'AMO is created in response to this terrible public health and economic crisis that has, as we all know, impacted the poor and the marginalized more so even than than others. The goal of ARPA is to lift up members of our community in a way that supports and sustains well-being in this unprecedented infusion of federal funds should be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'used in that spirit, we transform Alameda. We propose that the city use these other funds directly to address our communities in interconnected needs and struggles, specifically around housing, mental health, economic security and climate vulnerability. We realize, obviously, that not not all of you think these things can be fully addressed with this one funding source.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we think that this is these are the lenses through which we should be looking at how to spend these moneys and minds in the future to provide the fundamentals for a functioning community. So for housing, we really strongly support the Rainy Village in project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also would like to the City Council to consider looking to fund a community land trust or some other sort of thing to preserve housing, look ownership here. We love the idea of a mental health clinic that could potentially be housed in a park in a part of the hospital that's being underused right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'd love to see a a a resilience hub on the east and or central part of the island in order to when it inevitably gets very hot, we can have people have access to cooling in other parts of the island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And finally, we're really interested in a UBI pilot that fits Alameda specific needs. So I'll stop there. Thanks very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Laura Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Living there. It's nice to speak to you again. And you and the entire council I standing in for renewed hope advocates here and to say that we stand in full support of those priorities that were listed in the letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think you got a letter from me today to that effect. And I'm really happy to hear Josh talk before me because he pretty much put out all those priorities that we talked with you yesterday. I just want to say in general that I think this notion of community resilience is going to be very, very important'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in the years to come. I just think cities and towns everywhere and their leaders are going to be called to more and more to help the residents survive those natural disasters and a certain amount of social upheaval, as we can see from what came down just with COVID.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think the the loss of workers, the fact that we don't have workers in our restaurants and our businesses is really has made us less resilient in the last year. I think that's it's really unfortunate and it's something we're we're going to be looking at with if we follow these priorities through, I think our survival will'",
        "'speaker_3': 'depend on making sure that we all help one another and and erase that divide between the haves and have nots that seems to be growing, especially in the Bay Area. And all of these proposals really speak to values that we hold and renewed hope and we hold them in the Alameda Justice Alliance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think we actually many people in this community that have marched just in the last year to see past injustices remedied also hold these values. Everybody wants to see us move towards the care of the entire community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when we do move to care for the community, I think we're actually going to have that safe and secure community everybody really wants. So I thank you for your attention. I think these priorities are very important and renewed, hopefully supports them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nancy Schmidt.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Schmidt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thank you. I really appreciate your proposals here and the discussion completely and wholeheartedly agree. I did want to make sure that we come up with some kind of community criteria that does reflect our values when it comes to social justice and equity, and that if there is a way that we could measure how these dollars are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being spent and identify kind of almost a scoring mechanism, if we could, the reason being that one is this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and every penny that we get really needs to be spent to the best possible use and to have the most effect for the most people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So many are in need. And I I'm just curious because there had been discussions earlier in the previous agenda item discussing looking at different housing options. Kind of when it comes to cost effectiveness, but also impact, what's the impact going to be?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And are there ways that we can look at the impact of those dollars and not just simply looking at how much they cost and what those alternatives are, but to really look at the social impact, the equity impact, and then also how it reflects our values so that we if we were to give a report card back'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the community of Alameda, what would that report card say as far as how we chose to decide to spend those dollars? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So with that, I'm going to close public comment. And, you know, Mr. President, if I could just ask you, we've been on a couple of webinars together about our refunds, and I think you've probably been on even more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To just give the listeners an overview of the the reporting requirements, how strict it is to adhere to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The the structure, the requirements of this funding opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. And I'm going to I'm going to invite Andy and Jennifer into the conversation, if that's okay with you as well. But the the reporting where it's frequent, we have to be updating the federal government regularly on the use of our funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And he sent a calendar which I don't have in front of me right now, but I think she's looking for it. I think it's every three months or so that we are we're required to report. And really, the thing that's been stressed by all of the folks from the federal government who've talked with with city officials, is'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the the importance of of adhering to the to the the the eligible project list and making sure that there is accountability for the dollars that are spent so that the federal program doesn't have there's no ability to. It's beyond reproach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The idea is that these are these are an investment in your community. And they they we are ensuring that we are taking good care of the public dollar as we're investing in the community. And so any we'll have a lot more detail on the the report, the actual reporting requirements and frequency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the overall intent is to make sure that local governments are doing their their very best to be transparent with the community and investing in a way that's consistent with the interim final rule from the U.S. Department of Treasury.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Ms.. Two, what would you add to that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Jason, very comprehensive. Before you go, I know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I apologize for interrupting. I'm hearing a lot of static, as are others, too. Yes, it's very garbled. Any suggestions this way? I figure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do have a headset and I can share my screen with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You seen the screen?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so this is on the calendar. These are the operating dates is pretty much the first day is August 31st with interim report. And then there's a lot of strict requirements on a quarterly basis. By October 31st, we'll have to complete our second and third quarter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And every quarter we have to some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Points maybe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can call in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And actually, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I think this is probably deeper information than I really need. I suffice it to say, there are strict reporting requirements that the city will have to adhere to. But I think I wanted sort of the overview so far.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you both very much. And yeah, we we will have to figure out what the audio challenge was there. Council questions, comments, your recommendations, who would like to start? Councilmember Knox White thinks so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I really appreciate coming back with three different concepts. You know, for the most part, I do. I'm fairly supportive of the of the housing proposal. I do. I would I would be open to considering some form of you know, I would say say hybrid that had a little bit of business assistance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But for me, business assistance is not grants to businesses, but thinking about things that again, one time, one time funds that could actually go to rebuilding the resilience of our of our business areas, specifically downtown and in Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So whether that's ways in which to kind of make permanent some of the some of the things that we put in that are attracting people to our downtowns in order to in order to strengthen the local economy, those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason I asked about the budget, I think that if we were to put some of this into revenue loss and then we would have the flexibility to use that on projects we wanted to use. That would be the about the only way that I would be willing to consider revenue loss in this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to just see it as kind of backfilling things we've already actually dealt with in the budget. It's not to say that we didn't have pinches in the budget, but I really appreciated that what the first principle of one time only costs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But for the most part, I think your housing only proposal as it links up with item, our conversation around item six eight is probably the most impactful. I do agree with the this is a one time opportunity. Let's see and let's use it to to, you know, have some ongoing and strong future outcomes that we can look'",
        "'speaker_2': 'back and say we didn't we didn't squander this and just throw around 5000 here and 5000 there and wonder what happened with all the money. So thank you. It's a great, great, great work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Now it's like Councilmember Harry Spencer. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor, and thank you staff for this very comprehensive report. I am concerned about dedicating the 20 plus million dollars out of this 28 million for the purchase of the hotel. For me, I'd like to actually spread this as much as possible to impact as many people as possible that really have, I think, been greatly impacted and left'",
        "'speaker_0': 'out that the Internet, smart city, wireless hotspot service, wireless hotspots. I think that those are critical. This this gap of the digital gap, I think now we're having an opportunity to close it. And as we all know, we're having a meeting right now online that many people cannot access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They haven't been able to apply for honestly supports. They haven't been able to. All of the students trying to study this really been a hardship. They've been left out of our society for a year and a half now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for me, that's actually a very high priority. I also noticed in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Exhibit five that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's just comments in regards to your possibilities to support public health, support for isolation, quarantine, vulnerable populations to medical and public health services. I think that that's actually a very, very important to try to figure out how people that are vulnerable, when they're impacted from COVID, how how do they exist, they need help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that that does meet the needs. The assistance to households. That was another thing on exhibit five, food, rent, mortgage, utility, legal aid, cash assistance, things like that, as well as new and expanded child care. I think those types of services that cover low income, lots of people that are very vulnerable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that that's a very good use of this money and I'm really concerned when we're talking about dedicating, I think it'd be like 4/5 of the money to one project. It would impact maybe 50 people versus I'm going to just thousands of people that are have been left behind.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think we have to really think the medical especially, you know, so those things that I've just said, I'd like to see us to consider. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Let's go. Next, Councilmember De Salud.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Yeah. In terms of well, you know, to begin with, I would have loved to have some of the money towards a kind of a Jean Sweeney Park. But I accept staff's analysis saying that that's ineligible. And so we move on in terms of what's before us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I, I support one of the categories being housing. And if there's going to be an abundance of funds for particularly the Marina village in, I'm supportive of that. Although I want to make sure to say $20 million of the $28 million probably isn't the right number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So I'm sorry. That's that's just not going to work. I think what we what's what's going to drive the number is whatever our analysis in terms of the sales and all that kind of stuff. But my gut level tells me, you know, $20 million is too high and dedicating so much of the $28 million on one'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thing is probably not going to not going to fly. But I am supportive of housing and and dedicating a portion of that to the marina village. And because I do think it'll be a cause the way that I want to pursue it, at least it would be a permanent asset of the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And like I said, by virtue of its location to all the social and public and economic amenities, I think that makes it something that we shouldn't miss an opportunity to to to take advantage. It's not on the list explicitly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you know what keeps me up at night, especially when we got the report about the about the groundwater coming up as a result of sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's something that keeps me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Up at night. I know that it's not on the list, the category of sea level rise. But but I just want to note that it is something that keeps me up and it is something that cuts across the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know if somehow that's housing related insofar as, you know, all the houses, all the residential buildings or for that matter, all the buildings have to link up through our stormwater system or or take advantage of our stormwater system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I just want to know that that's the thing that keeps me up at night and I'll just leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, vice mayor of L.A..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I absolutely support spending ARPA funds as needed based off of our assessments relative to the Marina Village. And I think that that is a good use in terms of when we talk about equity, sometimes those who need the most help.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's really what equity is about, as is sometimes we are going to spend a significant amount of resources to have an impact on those who need the most help. And I think, you know, I think that we can do something really positive there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also think that there you know, if there are concerns relative to additional well, I think that we've addressed most of our budget shortages. But if there are service needs that are ongoing relative to providing services, I want to make sure that we're not cutting further services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do want to make sure that our budget is taken care of and we don't have additional cuts because I think we passed a fairly tight budget. I also would like to find a way to. To maximize the use of these funds for other housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to make sure that that direction is very clearly given to staff. So if it's not the Marina Village and what are other ways we can we can maximize and assist with the housing needs that we have, because that is the top council priority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think that there are other things that that are being discussed at the state level by Senator Skinner. Huddle is working on that. There's a number of other things. I think there's going to be multiple layers of assistance coming to families and to folks in need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I really do think that where we can make the greatest impact with the ARPA funds at the city of Alameda level really is towards meeting our housing needs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. So, just to wrap up, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Dropped my agenda. I'd be lost without it. I want to echo something Councilor Knox White said in our previous item. We should think big in what we're doing. These ARPA funds have been described as a once in a lifetime opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Once in a generation. This is the sort of thing that won't come around again. So we do want to do big things that make an impact. And and I applaud the the staff report. It's very well laid out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to just I draw your attention to page four of the staff report where there is that discussion about the housing, homelessness and behavioral health. And there are some projects that are are proposed the part of transitional housing program, the hotel acquisition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I agree with my colleagues who have said yes use ARPA funds toward the purchase of the marina village in but not all 20 million. And it's also important to remember that there are other sources. This is going to be a matter of cobbling together some sources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just so exciting to have these opportunities are coming added around the same time. But in addition to this federal money, we've got money coming in from the state. There's some county money that may actually be used to help us we may be able to use to help pay the operating costs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, no, we don't need to take 20 million of our 28 million for the marina village in. But we can we can have some pretty good seed money to help make that project a reality. But I also want to just go back to what a couple of the speakers have said, and I should stop and say it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'was a pleasure to meet yesterday on a screen like this, but with members of the Animated Justice Alliance, the Transform Alameda and the Alameda Renters Coalition. Thank you so much for enlightening me for your comments this evening on a number of different topics, including this one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We did talk a bit about this possibility of using part of Alameda Hospital as something akin to the Whitebread Clinic that you've heard discussed in these meetings before. That's the underpinning of the Cahoots Program in Eugene, Oregon, because it is this facility that provides mental health, physical health, substance abuse, housing, resource connections, and also things like just'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a day center, like a respite care for people who just need to get off the street where they're having whatever episode or mental health crisis they don't necessarily need to be committed or even overnight, but they just need a place to get away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we have started conversations. I will talk this up as often as they have the opportunity. And I know that our city manager, Eric Leavitt, is in conversation with the city managers of the city. Eric Hayward in San Leandro, right?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And we are neighboring cities, similarly sized and there is some interest and the city managers are looking into what the possible funding mechanism might be. I know they want us to connect back with health systems that oversees Alameda Hospital, Highland and others.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think there's some pretty exciting potential there for us to provide these alternative services that would be well needed by our community and maybe some of our neighbors. And also to help Alameda Hospital, which I understand is struggling a bit with low census numbers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, of course, our residents, property owners here in Alameda, whether you business or residential, you pay $298 every year in your property tax. I know because I chaired that campaign and, you know, we created the health care district to be able to levy that property tax.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's make sure our money is being well spent and maybe bring in some other dollars from outside communities. So very much interested in in pursuing that opportunity to to make that a reality with some of these are funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then as far as the universal basic income, just last week in the one of the trailer bills to the governor's budget, there is money, a nice pot of money for pilot programs, for universal basic income. What little I've been able to read about it, it would be directed toward youth, young people exiting the foster care system'",
        "'speaker_1': '. That's a population near and dear to my heart. Some of you know, I have a background as a probation officer, and these are kids who pretty much raise themselves sometimes just. Shuttled around from one foster home to another.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then they come to an age. They're young adults and they're out on their own. And so if they could be assisted with universal basic income and we have them here in Alameda and also some of the pilot program would be directed toward pregnant mothers in certain income categories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we've talked earlier, there's not much better investment you can make than in in children and babies and you know healthy growing up. So so I don't know that we need to set aside ARPA funds now at least maybe not in the first tranche because I think we should take take a shot at applying for those state'",
        "'speaker_1': 'funds. And at our mayors conference, county mayors conference meeting in May, one of our speakers was or our speaker was Michael Tubbs, former mayor of Stockton, California. And you probably all know about that two year pilot that Stockton did.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know the city manager and assistant city manager have Mr. Tag's contact information. He is now an advisor to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Economic adviser to Governor Newsom. So I think that's where that that UBI pilot program may have come from. I'm also really intrigued by the concept of a community of land trust. This is something that our neighbor Oakland has done and other cities as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was mentioned by a couple of the speakers and it's an opportunity when there's maybe a distressed property or foreclosed property for the city to buy it and, you know, turn it into that affordable housing. So maybe some money for an affordable for a community land trust.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then so with my meeting yesterday, I'm afraid we didn't get to talk about a community resiliency hub. I am really intrigued about what that is. I confess this is the first time I heard that term, so email me and tell me more about it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that might be something that we should look into too anyway. And I want to just send a huge shout out to all of the staff who helped put this report together. That was a lot of material, and I know you're going to have a lot of work to do with just these different allocations and the reporting'",
        "'speaker_1': 'requirements. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So with that, I let's see, I'm just looking back to the ask, is it that we are just giving staff directions? So okay, so the recommendation is to assign a portion of the 26.8 million and again in two tranches.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we've only got the first tranche right now from the ARPA, ARPA of 2021. So staff to you staff. And I'm going to include the city attorney and city clerk. Do you have a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Direction from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Us? Do you want need a motion? What's your pleasure?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Eric, take himself off our tickets.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To make sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Other too. I was thinking emotion if you wanted to. I mean, I think we have some direction, but I think a specific emotion would be helpful just to give us specific direction on which which of those approaches. I think I sort of understand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Mr. Bowden, you want to weigh in on what you've heard and what you might need in the form of a motion to provide clarity?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I guess what I will what I will say is that I heard from four council members, too, to focus on housing as in that Marina Village project. I think some of the earlier items this evening lend themselves to that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The timing will have to work work on a schedule for that piece of the project and our analysis of the true costs and the funding sources. I think public health came up in a couple of different contexts, and so I think that we could provide some additional options related to public health and how we how we invest'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in. You know, whether it's mental health clinic or whether it's other local support for public health. And then the the. Business assistance didn't come up more than once. I think it'd be great to hear counsel's direction related to the general fund and revenue loss.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess the only clarifier that I'll put on to that is that that funding does come back in and then it becomes part of a broader ability to spend on different priorities. And so it is more flexible in some ways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Once it does come back through the general fund so that that is something that we can continue to refine and we have until the end of 2024 to fully program all of these funds so we could look at it in future budget cycles as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so it doesn't have to be done tonight. But I just wanted to add that context on the the revenue loss discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Thank you for bringing that up. And I favor the approach that you just articulated because ARPA is wonderful, but we are limited to them. We have a lot of things we can spend on, but we are limited to the the regulations that the federal government has put forth.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If this money goes back into the general fund, it gives us much more flexibility for other things that we can spend on. So that would be my direction. But guess what? And that's what I was just going to call on you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for putting your hand up because you brought this up from the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So I would be supportive of that. But I would also want to make sure that we had some sort of spending guidelines. I don't want to say let's let's just ask for the 8 million. It's flexible and then it becomes kind of the grab bag.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not like if we're giving direction on the project, we should be. Then in my mind, the flexibility should go toward to meet the goals that we're spending the rest of the money on for the most part. And not that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You want to propose some.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I guess for me, I'm I feel like we're honing here still as opposed to just selecting, you know, and so so I think actually that the assistant city manager did a great job of of, you know, as the one business support person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will I will let that go. But I think I think he I think he did a good job of kind of outlining that in terms of the goals, I think that they should be kind of housing, mental health and and public health related programs that are not would not be reimbursable through this program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know what those would be. I didn't come actually prepared for for for kind of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And Vice Mayor Val, I set your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I was just going to say, I think that that's really what I was getting at. When I talk about the revenue loss and potential loss of services, I think we as a council can can outline what that would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my concern is, you know, if we're if we're looking at revenue loss, that could impact the services that we're trying to provide relative to this program or to other priorities. That's really what I would be looking for in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Counsel for her center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, and I was just going to say, Ross.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess maybe you guys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are relative to the business, and I think businesses are also included within that directive as an impact to loss of services. We have done a number of different things for our business districts, including providing outreach and things like that that have had and services that have provided, you know, overall help for the for the entire business district'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And I think to the extent that that so I do think it is relevant and tied to this conversation. Councilmember Knox, what I had said specifically, he's not necessarily interested in more grants. We've done a lot of grants with city funds, but I think that where we can leverage funds to provide services that are overarching, that meet'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a number of different needs, that's really what I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And Councilmember Harry Spencer. Thank you, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I wanted to follow up in regards to the smart city master plan that is on here, as well as the hotspots. I don't, of course, hear of any other support for it. So is there other money that the city is planning to use for that, or what is the I'm going to ask starter or is it'",
        "'speaker_0': 'going to be funded from some other way? Or what is what is the plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. And I will just throw in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Actually, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Support that too. Is it we I guess I thought we were doing this for categories, but are we? Mr. Bodie, can you help me understand, because I saw.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That the focus was in the report was on the four categories based on the input that was provided in May. But again, it it was it was an attempt to try and put our finger on where the the council wanted to, to focus the funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The there is the possibility of adding to the program as we go. We're in the planning stages for that smart city master plan, for example, and we have funding to plan. But in terms of dollars to actually build it out, those have not been identified.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if other funding sources come to the housing topic for the Marina Village Project and there there remains ARPA funding as we go, we should be able to we should be able to reallocate those things on a on a rolling basis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just don't want to wait too far in. I've been preaching that we have time, but eventually we will run out of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Councilmember Herrera. Spencer, go. Let's go back to you. I, I, I, I wanna hear what you have to say, and I think I support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I've been looking at these attachments, so we had multiple proposals, but we didn't just go line item by item. We're looking at your proposals as well as the categories. But one of them had wireless hotspots, $50,000. Is that something that's a standalone that we could dedicate $50,000 to hotspots?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is, and it's something that we could do. It's probably one of the, I'll say, lower hanging fruit, but probably very impactful, particularly as people are still doing a lot of things from their home at this point in time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then there is also. So that's I think I think so. Right. So I think that's very important. But the service wireless lending hotspot, 18,007, what can you describe what that is and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. This would be a program delivered by the library. We would essentially let people sign out hotspots. And I can't remember the number of devices, but it's a lot like your video. Your wireless system is 30. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you'll be able you know, a household could theoretically be powered by one of these hotspots that they've signed out from the library, and there'd be no cost for that. It would just be like checking out a book and this program would fund the service and and and then obviously it would come back over time and it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wouldn't just be something that would be given out forever. It would be on a lending basis. So if somebody did it for a couple of weeks, they could do that. They needed it for longer. We could probably figure that out, too.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then that virus hotspots. Can you say give us a description of where those would be across town?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These are these this is all part of the library program. The broadband system would allow us to to create a network across the city to really create an Internet of basically a hard wired system that would allow us to increase Internet speeds across our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The wireless hotspots could be adapted to those, and we could certainly stand up a broader network. So there's the lending from the library, and then there's the hard infrastructure, as well as the wireless infrastructure that would come with it, with the with the overall broadband program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they're all tied to smart cities, whether it's a lending system or whether it's physical improvements and infrastructure. It is part of our broader effort to improve connectivity across the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. But if we don't. If we don't. So I'm not hearing 6 million. Maybe I didn't hear. Maybe I misheard or whatever. But you have on here another you have the 54 hot spots and then you have 18 seven for the landing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you're talking about broadband, is that under the master plan, 6 million or is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, that's the broadband is the 6 million. It's the Smart City program that basically would be a fiber network across the city, wi fi in our business districts. It's a it's an entire system that would be in the ground and above the ground that would that would improve connectivity across the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So can the 50,000 and the 18 seven be used without that or you need the system.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That can be used without that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would like us to at least consider the 70,000 to help people be able to have Internet access. But my preference is to do the 6 million plus. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm supportive of what Councilmember Harry Spencer says. And also bear in mind that we're talking about two tranches. So to the extent that some things really need to be done now and some can be done.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In a year when we get the other.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Half.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or leveraging some of the money toward that. But I think that's very important. Mr. LEVIN. Actually, excuse my interruption. The city clerk would normally be reminding me we need to make a motion council before 11:00 and it's 10:52 p.m..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we have these remaining items before us on the regular agenda. 60 is the police policy. Six F is the public art ordinance and six G is the Sunshine Ordinance. There are also five council referrals, but I don't think so.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But do we have a motion to. I would entertain going to midnight to try to get at least D.F. and G heard. Councilor Max White, a motion made by Councilmember Knox White to add the secondary need for votes to pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we need to do it fast before 11. Face Maravilla There you go for a second. Thank you, Mayor. We have a roll call. Vote, please, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A fleur de thug. I heard Spencer now Knox and actually I Leola. I may or as the Ashcraft high net carries.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Four, two, one. Thank you. Okay. Who is speaking with it? Oh, Mr. Leavitt, I am sorry I had to interrupt. Yeah, go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But based on what I have heard in the last in the discussion, specifically in the last probably 10 minutes to 15 minutes, I would recommend that you direct us to go back and bring back a program that that's a combination of option one and option two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because I think your focus was the housing, but also option one had a lot of the focus on things such as broadband and that type of infrastructure. The revenue loss could be used towards the housing and bring back a package combining those two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be my recommendation because we could probably narrow the broadband, maybe not go the full 6 million and maybe do some of the elements that have been talked about tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That sounds promising. What do we think, council? Councilmember Knox white guy. Any thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I guess I just want to say I am supportive of the the wireless hotspots and whatnot that the councilmember, her sponsor, was talking about. I'm going to get a little nervous when we start getting the broadband ahead of us actually having a smart, smart city plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If staff is, I'm not going to say don't bring it back. But I'm because I have some concerns and I'd like to know a lot more about what literally we're going to do as opposed to just putting some broadband in and hoping to connect street lights and traffic lights to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that to me, that's not good. That's not what I'm thinking about when I'm thinking big and and impactful. So they're just throwing that out there on the on the broadband. I'm a little. Yes. The wireless hotspots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we're not 100% onboard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Yeah. I can hear her, Spencer. Still muted when more.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. My apologies. I continue to keep having unstable internet here. So is it is it possible to get more information from staff in regards to how many what percentage of our population actually has not had Internet does not have Internet access and how impacted they are?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because maybe I'm overestimating the impact. I feel like it's a very important need that impacts many. But obviously I'm not hearing that from my I don't really feel like I'm here. It's very much. So I do appreciate some of the support, but I would like some more information if possible, in regards to how great is the need'",
        "'speaker_0': ', because maybe I'm overestimating it. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I would suggest that rather than send staff to do more data digging, that we actually pursue this in the manner that the city manager proposed and to have him come back. I'm mindful of Councilmember NOx. We don't want to get too far out of our smart city plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, there's some other ways we may be able to fund that. Infrastructure bills come in, come in from the feds soon, we hope. But, I mean, I do think that was a plausible suggestion by the city manager to have staff come back with this combination.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Kels very nicely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wish I could say I was a part of weekly meetings last summer with the school district to kind of answer that question. At the end of the day, while there were a few people, it was the numbers were not huge and they were very disparate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what we found was that it was not something where infrastructure specifically was going to solve the issue, that there was there were needs of folks who had more need for a specific one household connection, as opposed to giant backbones of infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so nothing kind of really moved forward because the school district was already handing out hot spots to families that needed them. So I think that that's where I think the hotspot idea continues to kind of build upon that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then as we're doing the Smart City rethink, we can plug in further with what we learn.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fazio. So, yes, I've heard about the students getting them, but I've also heard the seniors that we normally see at these meetings have not been participating. And I think that that is actually a need. So maybe Mastic can help us figure out how we're going to connect our seniors to our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's have a motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will move. It is unfair. I'm not going to move to support the city manager's recommendation to combine to have staff come back with a combination of options one in two that has a housing focus but includes some revenue loss, flex for flexibility and wireless hotspot, and potentially some broadband support as discussed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in addition to the public health and mental health that was all folded in. Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. Yes, that was perfect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have a have had a motion. May we have a second, please? Health over day 3 seconds. All right. Maybe we have a real cover up with expectation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, it is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Were Spencer, I not quite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Leola. Mayor as he Ashcraft High that carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Thank you again, staff. Good work. Thank you, counsel. Good discussion. Let's move quickly on to item six D Medicare for you introduced. That was a thank you staff. Good to see you all. Good night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Recommendation to authorize the chief of police to update the existing Alameda Police Department policy manual to be current with the existing best practices and statutory requirements.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I know there is a little changing of the guard here. And as I believe our new police chief, at some point, I suppose we have to stop saying new, but he's still pretty new. Here is our police chief, Nishant Joshi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcome, Chief Joshi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor, and city members of the City Council. So I'm the item that I'm bringing for it has to do with departmental policies. Well, when I first came to the department about five weeks ago, I learned that there were several policies that required updates to meet statutory requirements and best practices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the department contracts with a company called Flexible and Flexible develops and updates. Our policies, like support, consists of a team of policy and legal researchers and attorneys who regularly review case law and legislative updates along with industry best practices as they make these reviews.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They automatically, excuse me, send policy update recommendations to the department. The department has reviewed the recommendations and is going to ask for authorization to update the policy. So I'll provide a brief overview. There are several policies of of that that include the recommendations that are in here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll start with the first policy, and that's policy 300 that is on use of force. The previous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Chief Joshi, I apologize for the interruption. I did also just want to introduce the other individual on camera who just came on is Alan Cohn from our city attorney's office, who represents the police department. Welcome, Mr. Cohen. All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry, Chief. Back to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You. Oh, no problem at all. So the first policy is excuse me, policy 300 on use of force. The previous policy did not contain language that specifically prohibited the use of the carotid restraint or chokehold. And so the department did remove that as a as a force option last year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, now this policy recommendation includes specific language that calls out and prohibits the use of such holds. The California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training removed the instruction as well. And so we're recommending that we accept this recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll move on to the next policy. That's policy 314. That's on vehicle pursuits. The previous policy had language that permitted a secondary vehicle that's involved in a pursuit to notify dispatch of the pursuit. And it says as soon as reasonably practicable, practicable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The new language is actually more straightforward, and it directs a secondary unit to notify dispatch of their involvement in a pursuit immediately. And this is significant, especially as a chief. There's an as I think about risk it with vehicle pursuits, there's an inherent risk associated with vehicle pursuits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then anytime we add an additional vehicle in a pursuit, the risk increases as well. So we don't want any delayed information about how many units are involved in pursuit because we want our monitoring supervisor commander to be in a position of advantage where we're I require them to constantly monitor the pursuit detail so they can determine'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whether or not to cancel a pursuit. So it's minor language, but I think it's very relevant and important to adopt. Next policy is 320 on domestic violence investigations. Previous policy included factors such as marital status between the aggressor and the victim.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The new policy is inclusive of all classes policy 324, which is temporary custody of juveniles. The policy, the previous policy defined, quote, sight and sound separation as located or arranged to prevent physical, visual and auditory contact. The new policy continues that definition, but also adds that is more than brief or inadvertent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's just clarifying language on existing policy. The previous policy also directed officers to transport juveniles who are suspected of using a firearm in a crime to a juvenile facility. The new policy actually increases that threshold by directing officers to transfer juveniles who use a firearm to commit a felony.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'And these are a really good fit for young or emerging artists. Not all of them have are operating under nonprofits. So making this change would give the Public Art Commission more flexibility to fund emerging artists. The park, however, still intends to maintain that nonprofit requirement for grants over $2,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They would just do that through a series of public art guidelines rather than written into the ordinance. And finally, the current ordinance requires that any expenditure from the Public Art Fund be approved by City Council. The park is recommending that City Council approval only be needed for expenditures above the purchase authority of the city manager, which is'",
        "'speaker_0': '$75,000. So this would allow the park to make small changes to public art grants and to implement smaller grants and grant programs in a more flexible and efficient manner. Of course, City Council approval of budget appropriation from the Public Art Fund will continue to be required.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The image here shows the fabrication of Palomar, which will be a 12 foot tall bronze squid that will be located at Alameda Point near the heated building. In retrospect, the installation of this artwork this winter or next spring's next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in April of 2021, the Planning Board also reviewed the proposed changes. They made some excellent recommendations which are listed here. We've incorporated these comments into the draft revised ordinance and in May the Planning Board voted to recommend City Council adopt the proposed changes to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There was one concern that the Planning Board actually brings to City Council for consideration. Specifically, they were concerned that the ordinances exemption for 100% affordable housing might result in less public art and affordable housing projects and therefore inequitable outcomes for the folks who live there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One suggestion that the Planning Board made with that was that that exemption only apply if inclusion of the art is an economic impediment to project development. Another way to address this might be to direct the Public Art Commission to consider proximity to affordable housing or other equity measures when selecting public art.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And both of these ideas are listed as alternatives in the staff report. Next slide, please. So staff recommendation is that City Council adopts the proposed city wide text amendments to the City of Alameda Zoning Ordinance to modify public art requirements.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So the exception is the removal of public art from the city's public art collection. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Have we done that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have not done that yet. Generally, there are a variety of ways that you can do that. You can sell the artwork, you can. Unfortunately, sometimes you have to you might have to destroy the artwork if it's degraded to such a point that it that it can't be restored.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there are a few different ways to handle that. But it is a process that's governed by state and federal law and is a lengthy process.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'We do not.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for all the great work. To you. I know that it's been a lot of work that's gone into this and to our various boards and commissions. I did want to just make one suggestion. I am prepared to support it.'",

I am doubtful that we will get too many calls for review, but I think it might be a way to to balance that that need of just making the council aware at the same time that allowing that the expenditure to move'",
        "'speaker_2': 'forward quickly without having to delay for council approval. But other than that, great work and I'd be happy to. So I see the city attorney.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Do you have a preference on which way you like to proceed? I think if we could move forward with this as a first reading, with that minor adjustment as first reading, I'd like it in the ordinance because I think it's just clear to have it there rather than hoping that somebody remembers that that was the direction, which'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure all of you will, but someday you all of you will have found even better jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And would that still constitute a first reading Mr. Show?'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Counsel's direction. Councilmember Knox, why, if I may, may I suggest that the modification be in subsection F of 30 dash 98.10. That is the subsection that talks about city manager expenditures. And perhaps we just add a sentence to reflect your direction, which is that any approvals of expenditure by the city manager shall be the city manager shall'",
        "'speaker_2': 'promptly notify the Council of such expenditure. Does that work for you? As long as. I guess. My only question is if the city manager's approved, the expenditure is there. Has the expenditure been made and therefore isn't called for review?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because my interest is in giving giving future council people the ability to to raise their hand and say, whoa, that is really offensive. I can't believe nobody cut that. I think we should have a discussion about this before it gets spent in and and put up in town.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's say I'm just using a very hyperbolic example. I'm sure Governor Christie would never do that. But I'm just saying, you know, they did. So I guess my question is, is there a place is there a place before the city manager or is it possible to give the city manager the ability to approve it with a ten'",
        "'speaker_2': 'day? You know, it doesn't go into effect for ten days or five days. I don't think it has to be like weeks and weeks and weeks of review. I just want an start in it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's hear what the city manager has to say.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. LEVITT I've done not on public art, but similar type of structure where I have to inform the council ten days. And I don't know if you can put by ordinance or direction. They inform the council ten days prior to approving the purchase, saying I'm intending to approve the purchase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If a council wants to appeal that approval, they can do it within that ten day frame and then it doesn't actually get approved and signed up and it goes straight to council. That would be perfect. It.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this butler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you want to hear about minor, minor changes? Like, for example, we came back to council for 15,000, a 1500 dollar increase in to pay for overages on one of the contracts. Do you also want to hear about those?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Before? COUNCILMEMBER That's right. Answers I think you're talking about actual installations, aren't you, that things that you would be concerned that neighbors might complain about or. Um, but, you know, to to Ms.. Butler's question, what would you what would you say?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. It might get too complicated to start trying to put together a list of what is and isn't. To me, I'm much more interested from my standpoint on this one. This is approving their work gets approved and it's a $55,000 artwork.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just think that should be alerted rather than he used to come here. I'm just saying give us the heads up that it's coming forward. If it's if it's an overage of within 10% or something like that, and it's still under the thing, you know, I don't think this isn't about is it worth it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's it's much more about the artwork. So I think that in this Butler's example, no, I wouldn't personally need to see that. I just don't know if it makes it too complicated to try it out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Let's go back to Mr. Leavitt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. The way I understood the concern was it's about the artwork, not necessarily the expenditure being five or 10,000. It was artwork and the impact or concerns that could grow in the community. And if that council member wanted to bring up for review, that would do that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's what the ten day suggestion was regarding. So if there's a way to phrase that so that it's not change orders and things like that, I think that that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then just take me one step further. Councilmember Knox Right. So say the someone in the public says, I hate that it comes to the council. What is the council do?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think somebody in the well, I mean, somebody the public could say that they hate it. It doesn't go up. So this is this is before the before the city manager has been authorized to make the payment to make the payments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is basically right now, the Public Art Commission makes a decision and then comes to the council for our vote of approval. What's proposed is we don't ever see the artwork if it's under the city manager's threshold.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm saying give us the opportunity to at least see the artwork and have a Oh my gosh, we shouldn't be putting that up then if it's up, it's already been paid for. So we're outside of this process. It's no different than what happens if it happens today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, I see what you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just like I said, I should have had a really simple way call for review is to counsel people. We have a process for that. And just I think we should just I don't see it getting used very often, but I can see it being the kind of thing that people wish it had existed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it does become that one problem in 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Other. Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'DE So just maybe two or three points. The first point is it sounds like we're almost creating a whole new animal called public art. A call for review. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. I'm not opposed to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm just saying. I'd be careful about that. The second thing is, do we have a sense if we could sample the number of projects that required public art? Do we have a sense, at least, you know, as to and I'm not asking you to be precise, do we have a sense as to how many were below 75,000'",
        "'speaker_2': '? Because I kind of want to get how many and what's the universe. So what percentage tends to be below 75,000? Do we do we have a notion about that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Miss Butler. Mr. Key.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the expenditures from the Public Art Fund are typically what we're talking about right now in terms of bringing to council. And we have at this point given $150,000 grant, one $50,000 grant, and I would say the rest were under 75,000.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that includes two or three public art grants and then about 16 small grants between five and 10,000.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's my sense is I got to believe that, you know, where we're giving, you know, kind of small things that are like below. It's just that's just my hunch, which kind of like. Suggests to me that a lot of the I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I think my thing is I sure hate to give up counts of a prerogative as if it was my for good. If I don't want to give it up, it's getting late so that that's just I do sense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And with this because the public art fans are not always going to be spent on an installation of an actual physical art piece. Is that correct? It could also be performance art. So is that something that would come to the council if it's under the city council, a city manager's approval threshold?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilmember decide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I just have another question. And so if you wanted to answer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought you were going to answer mine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, no, I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, well, let's go sequentially. Where is is that councilman, is that what you would contemplate any expenditure under?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would have it be any expenditure under the for for a new piece of art, for a newly approved piece of art is how I would say it. So again, back to Miss Butler's example. If the price goes up 1500 dollars, I don't want to have to I don't think we need to be reviewing that type of'",
        "'speaker_1': '. That that physical art as opposed to, say, the waterways project. That rhythmic, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Would say all of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just I don't expect it to be. I'm just saying. Give us the opportunity. Is that kind of Councilmember de point? Yeah, we do. Currently, the buck stops here and I think we're just giving us ourselves the opportunity to raise our hand and say, whoa, whoa, whoa, I've got a problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Whether it's dance or sculpture. I think that the form of the art to me doesn't. Change. That doesn't change that. There could be a concert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To account for her death.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think my basic question is, has there been any harm in the fact that we know that that the counts I mean, have we somehow slowed up the process?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I guess what's what's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kind of like behind I mean and I don't mean that in a nefarious way, but but what's the source of what I mean? Yeah, I hope you get my question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's getting late.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I to go with Mr. Leavitt and then this butler. And you're muted, Mr. Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll defer to Ms.. Butler first.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, Miss Butler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've had to come back on change orders. And for small grants like the small grant projects, we couldn't go forward. It was the small grant projects. We were giving out $2,000 grants and we gave out 20 of them for 2000 or less.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that project could not go forward until we we came to city council and said, we're doing this grant program. We had a 1500 dollars change order that happened. And I. I'm not sure, but I believe it was over the break.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that the city manager has powers over the break, but we had to wait for that to go forward. We we have another change that we would bring forward to you. A change order that we would bring forward to you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That will take at least a month. It usually takes about six weeks with what the staff reports. I think if anything, it's it's really that change orders that really get get us hold us up. So and and the small grants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It would be nice to do those if if there's a choice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I can comment on that, my. And thank you, Mrs. Butler. My two comments on that would be. Okay. I could understand change orders because when it comes to change orders, what that means is we have an art that we have adopted and accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's somewhere or and for whatever reason, you know, they they they are they spent $3,000 more. So I can understand how we don't. But but in terms of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'New art, even if it's like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A whole slew of 15, $3,000 each art. I still feel like that's the council prerogative. So I'll just leave it at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And the. Mr. Levy, we'll hear from you and then we're going to take a vote, because we do have one more item we're trying to get to before midnight. And this is huge. So, Mr. Levy, then Councilor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Based on the comments I've heard, I would recommend that maybe you just changed the ordinance to that under 75,000 or let's say 10% for change orders the city manager could approve. But for original art, even small grants that has to come to council that I maintain that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's a thought councilor for her, Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Though I do have concerns about not having an ability to review proposed projects. However, I think the city manager's comments might very well guess that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Let's count through our days, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do want to say I hear what Ms.. Butler is saying. So if if they want to come back in one year or two years and say, you know what, this is still a problem, then okay, then let's deal with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do agree. I like with the city manager, it's suggested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would you like to fashion that into a motion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, you know. Slate will Councilmember Harris does or or Councilmember dogs played fascinated film who.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What are the difference time zone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know. I think I'm kidding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sorry I wasn't clear on that concept. Do we? Okay. We have had a proposal from the city manager. I mean, would you be able to read that back to us?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think it's just an interaction ordinance. Do we need that language specific language city attorney? That's a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just I haven't heard from either you or the vice mayor about whether you feel that everything does need to come to us for approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kind of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I would not bring change back in the thing. I guess we have a public art commission. I think they're pretty confident. I have a lot of faith in staff who works with these issues day in and day out and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I made this proposal, so I. I just worry that we can get down into the weeds and really delay projects. And so, no, I didn't see it as such a compelling need. And, you know, when it comes to art, it's just, you know, it's so subjective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Eye of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Beholder.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What standards are the the council going to to apply?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was comfortable with the staff's proposal. But I, you know, I'm hearing the city manager's proposed modification, which I think is reasonable. So that's where I am. And. Vice Mayor, did you want to add anything?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm fine with the city manager's proposal and proposed modification, I should say, rather than proposal. I do get concerned with the amount of things that potentially would be run by the council and can come through here. I think there's a lot of other items that we are dealing with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do hear Councilmember Knox weigh in his concern relative to the kind of the outlier situations that might exist. But I feel like it's not enough to really convince me to want to legislate around that issue. Or to allow for that issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that it could ultimately and I guess my concern is that it could ultimately result in a lot of things coming to council as opposed to finding a way for that one issue to get raised and then for us to address things as they actually arise.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't I just feel like we're kind of ledges that we would be trying to address an issue that hasn't really come up and would be a rarity and potentially could be. Misused, I guess you could say, resulting in kind of more things coming to council than are needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Councilwoman Maxwell, I see a question.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And you're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a little confused because currently everything comes to council staff proposal, nothing comes to council. We've got two people saying they want everything to come to council, not YouTube, not sorry, I'm sorry. I'm putting the pictures on the screen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's terrible. But I hear council member de-stocking her expense, are saying they'd like to have everything come for approval. I'm hearing mayor as the know. Okay. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was comfortable with what staff was proposing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That all our comes accept change orders.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, under the threshold that is the city manager's. Expenditure authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Misunderstood him. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I saw that the way that the mayors.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Reiterating may look back over the the staff report to pull that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Out, waiting for the city manager to jump in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And say, manager, feel free to do that. Are actually Mr. Key and Ms.. Ms.. Butler. I don't want to miss sides.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I just say, like the City Planning Board, all of our items can be appealed to the city council. So there's a ten day period after approval that they can be approved uphill to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's cancer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's 25 seconds. Explain something. When I as a council member approve of an art, I kind of feel like Santa Claus. I kind of feel like I'm bequeathing I'm helping bequeath this something that's going to be of artistic benefit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just don't want to give up that. That's my point is I just don't want to give that up. And so to me, you know, appealing just doesn't work. I'd like to approve art.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, fair enough. Let's take a vote. Where's the emotion? Let's vote on it. Mr. Shannon, did you want to add something before we vote?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'May I read the wording of the change before you vote so that you know what you're voting on?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or we still need a motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So maybe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think we want to hear what it is that the proposed. Yeah. Let's hear from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think the change will. Now I'll read the whole paragraph. The Alameda City Council shall authorize expenditures from the Alameda Public Arts Fund consistent with the purpose of this article, except that the city manager shall be authorized to approve change orders within the city manager spending authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All requisitions and purchases shall be authorized consistent with approval authorizations in the City of Alameda Purchasing Policy, the city manager shall notify the Council of any expenditure approved by the City Manager on any change order. Any two council members may call the city manager's decision for review within ten days of the city manager's notification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If no call for review is timely perfected, the city manager's decision shall become final and effective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And just to clarify, but that's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Days ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's the change orders. So so we still have authority over everything else? Yeah. Okay, good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here, change orders. Okay. Okay. So that's been moved. Maybe we have a second. Councilmember Harry Spencer. Okay. And just so I'm clear. A vote not to approve that proposal would leave the ordinance. With what? With coming back to council for everything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Change orders included.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that correct, Miss Butler?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Status quo.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. That part of the ordinance. Unless you don't vote on the ordinance. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I would like us not to get into the weeds that much, so. Okay. We have a motion in seconded. Right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Remind me who made it again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any customer based on the motion councilmember. Her sponsor. Seconded.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I thought the proposal was to not just have that for the change order, but to have it for for everything. And then to go to the call for review for everything. The I understand that it's only for that one provision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was my recommended change to what was previously proposed. So I'm consistent. My change proposal was consistent with what the city attorney read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And this is. Okay. And this is actually you're amending the ordinance to add this language, correct? Yes. Okay. And Mr. Shen directs us again to the provision, the particular section.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In subsection F of section 30, dash 98.10. Which is on page nine of 11.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm sorry. I am not finding that this is in the witch exhibit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's in the ordinance, which I don't think it has an exhibit. It's not. It's neither exhibit. It's sort of the fifth link down. It just says ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the ordinance is four pages long. Sorry. Sorry. I was on that roll. It just jumped to a different item.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Okay, let's do nine over 11. Okay. And so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'F. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So she has to office expenditures that exceed the purchasing power she managed for the authority of city manager to. So with that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our sister.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And we're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This motion is to remove change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Orders from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the council would be approving. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So maybe I'll just reread the whole paragraph because this motion changes this paragraph completely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of people were nodding and you don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. You go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just read the whole paragraph. Some of the council's clear. The Alameda City Council shall authorize expenditures from the Alameda Public Arts Fund consistent with the purchase purpose of this article, comma. Except that the city manager shall be authorized to approve change orders within the City Manager Spending Authority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All requisitions and purchases shall be authorized consistent with the approval authorizations in the City of Alameda Purchasing Policy. The City Manager shall notify the Council of any expenditure approved by the City Manager on any change order. Any two councilmembers may call the city manager's decision for review within ten days of the city manager's notification.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If no call for review is timely perfected, the city manager's decision shall be final and effective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Let's have a vote. Any more questions? Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I was okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not fake calls from then by super villain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not sure if I'm going to be trying to decide if I'm going to support this or not, because it's actually the almost the opposite of what I was proposing, which was that we be notified by art but let it go through and not be notified about to change orders.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I feel like this is this is reversing the recommendation that I supported when I was just trying to give us a little bit more whatever. And so if we could if there is support of a majority of the council, which I think since shaking heads there is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With, would you like to attempt to find the amendment, actually hold that from the amendment, if possible, from the amendment. Let's hear from Vice Mayor Vella, because you look concerned as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually don't think it's a friendly amendment. I think it's a separate defense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So you don't think so, do you? Okay. That's why I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think it's a good.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alternative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Substitute motion. Substitute motion, I think because anyways, I well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You you can propose a substitute motion and if it's seconded, that will get voted on first. If I recall policy procedures correctly, if you want to make such a motion council member. That's why.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I ah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Advised Mayor Villa because no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No I'd like counsel over, not wait to make the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Determination just as to have specific language. I would just ask if the city attorney is their language. You could quickly just shift to make it so that our word, the notification is for any approvals under the city manager's spending authority.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any art approvals, but not change. Order.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, just change orders are within his authority that we've already approved the art. Those don't need to come to us like that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I hope.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I thought I heard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to be clear so that what I read to you does not allow the city managers to approve any new artwork. What you're saying is that you do want the city manager to produce, which is the staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Which is the staff recommendation. Okay. All we were trying to do is just give a little like heads up. We've approved this. You got ten days to say, Oh my God, I hate that. Bring it to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So allow the city manager the authority, but simultaneously bring that notice to the City Council within ten days of the decision being made.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Eric had language that I think is needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Levitt, can you can you restate because I did. I will see if I wrote it down. Could you restate it one more time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I was focused on allowing you to continue to seem to approve the artwork based on what I was hearing and then do what my my recommendation was consistent with what the city attorney read. But it sounds like the majority of the council wants to go a different direction maybe, or some councilmembers a different direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I, I think you may have a three vote majority. Councilmember Knox. Right. For the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Art approvals under.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. But the standard for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mediation with notification. So I'm prepared to read something new if that's helpful.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're prepared to hear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Something is so. Okay. Rebecca, on page nine of 11.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So replacing paragraph F again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right now it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Reads The Alameda City Council shall authorize expenditures from the Public Arts Fund consistent with the purpose of this article, except that the city manager shall be authorized to approve expenditures within the city manager spending authority. All requisitions and purchases shall be authorized consistent with approval authorizations in the City of Alameda Purchasing Policy.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Do we need the date by which the city manager notifies the council so that we're not. Time to do the for review. Has it passed?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's ten days from his notification.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't matter until he. Until he tells us something. It doesn't matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Got it. Ten days from the notification. Okay. All right. Councilmember Dogfight, is that your emotions?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My emotion. Okay. My emotion. That I am.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Establishing emotion of my values. Seconding Councilmember De thought. Your hands up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just a quick comment. I just hate to give up my council prerogative when it comes to approving public art from the Arts Commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Understood. Thank you. May we have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm so invitation no or censor my next fight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fella. Hi. Mayor. As he Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'High, that carries 4 to 1. Okay. All right, counselor. It is 1155, which I think is a bit late before midnight to hear the Sunshine Ordinance item. Would you agree? So with that Councilmember Knox way. You're muted. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The long way. A long way across my screen from my mouse. Can I move that? We continue item 60 to a 659 meeting on September 7th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, that we can do that. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Clerk right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There. Yes. You need a second for that motion. Nice for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Villa. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. May we have a roll covered Annapolis member guy? Oh, hold it. Sorry. Sorry, Mr. Shin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. September 30th of Friday. Council member.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He said seven, I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh seven. I'm sorry. I haven't heard you. And I think it's important as a meeting date, but I remember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is getting late, people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, Counselor, it is not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Her center. I know it's right. Sorry. As I. I carries by five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Well, then. And actually, council and staff. I want to thank all of you. You've done a tremendous amount of work since the beginning of this year. Actually, since the beginning of this pandemic. I kind of feel like we have been doing double duty.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've had a lot of heavy issues coming before us. I feel like we're getting things done and I really we couldn't we couldn't do it without each other. So thank you for the role that staff plays. We have a very hardworking staff and we stretched some really thin and we're so grateful.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so to all of you, enjoy a month off without council meetings, get some well-needed rest and relaxation, come back revitalized because we've got more important work to do. But again, I really we don't always agree and see eye to eye, but it is an honor and a privilege to serve with all of you and to serve'",
        "'speaker_1': 'with the staff. And so thank you very much and have a great summer. We'll see you in September. Take care of you. Goodnight.'"
