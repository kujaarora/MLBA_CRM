        "'speaker_2': 'So those overall showed very good growth results, some of them because there are some new businesses that are opening up, in other cases because the existing businesses are doing well. One of the concerning, I guess points is something that the city is really unable to deal with and it's really subject to fluctuations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is the sales tax on fuel? That's one of the items that, as you see, the prices of the fuels go down. Even though it's great for all of us individuals, it also means that the sales tax is not collected and not as much tax collected on the reduced amounts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's one of those items that has a positive effect to individuals, but not necessarily for the city. There is also a decrease in lumber and in business and industry, and that's primarily, again, due to some of the adjustments that were posted by the Board of Equalization.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And unfortunately, those are not something we we the city control. A lot of the adjustments that are being made are for businesses that end up reporting two quarters in one period, and therefore sometimes they're inflated or rather deflated.'",

So these are corporations that are operating out at Horrible Business Park, and I think it was just great to see these kind of businesses because clearly they must be whatever business, the business activity they're doing, they must be identifying'",

Because the mayor and I went out to Penumbra about ten days ago or so to celebrate their help, be with them, to celebrate their annual employee appreciation.'",

The contract is set up so that they charge 65% of the cost of the building permit, so that we are always providing services to applicants within the budget that we charge for building permits.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our next speaker is Karen Walled and then Patricia Nash and then Angela.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Talk about Madam Chair, can I ask you a question? I noticed we've got some young children in the audience. I wonder if you would consider if those parents were interested in maybe letting them go ahead because it's getting a little late for young children.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, you might ask if anyone who's a speaker with young children might like to be allowed to go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have anyone with young children. If you are on this agenda item and if you'd like to go ahead, please let the clerk know your name. Thank you. Otherwise, let's continue, please. Thank you. WARD Patricia Nash and then Angela Hawk about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, I'm Karen. I don't know any of you because I only moved here a few months ago, but I hope I'm going to get to know you so. Especially since I'm expected to vote for you within a reasonable period of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My daughter and her family moved here and so that she could teach in this area. And so I moved to both because there's lots of nice things about Alameda and because I don't like being more than 20 minutes from my grandchildren.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's lots of good volunteer work to do here. Every day. I came out to the Bay Area in 1965 when I graduated from Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations and have never thought of going back East not only because it's too cold, but because I really like the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've lived in Berkeley, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose and now Alameda. All of the other cities that I lived in did have some form of rent control and some kind of renters rights office that the city sponsored and that I learned a great deal from.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even when I was a homeowner, that I felt was a very worthwhile contribution to our community. Among the. Well, I won't go into all the good qualities of Alameda because I think you all know them. But one of the things that does concern me is the lack of diversity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And what hit me directly was the lack of economic diversity. It was very hard. I'm a retired teacher. I live on CalSTRS. We get 1% at most increase per year. That doesn't even come to a fraction of what landlords feel that it's okay to raise rents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it really was not easy. I had to spend a lot of time trying to find a place that I could live here. I actually had to have my children cosign with me to be able to rent here because they didn't feel that that I could afford to rent in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Although I've never in my life had any trouble paying either my mortgage as a homeowner or my rent. I think you want people like me. I think you want people like us. My daughter is also a teacher, an educator.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My son my son in law works in solar energy. But this influx that other people have mentioned, especially come in from San Francisco, is making it harder and harder for working families to actually settle here. The kind of families that I think you want you want to have here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what I'm hoping.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that since you're surrounded by other cities that do have rent control and renters rights ordinances, that you may already be doing this. As I said, I'm new.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here, but that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you haven't, that you work together with them, you know, consult with your colleagues in other cities and find out what's working in other cities so that we could have that here in Alameda, my daughter and son in law are hoping to buy a house when as soon as they sell their house in San Jose, they want'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to buy here in Alameda, which means I want to stay in Alameda, too, but I need to be able to afford it. So I'm hoping that you're going to work to make that possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Patricia Nash And then answer our Haggadah. And I'd appreciate if you'd hold your applause. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Oh, sorry about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor. Spencer and city council members. I am Patricia Nash. I've lived in Alameda for 33 years. I'm a grandmother of four, mother of three, and I love it here. I'm a member of the Alameda Renters Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Disability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Committee. Our committee members have come here to show our support for creating a rent control ordinance and finish passing an ordinance for universal design in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People with disabilities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are much more affected by the renters crisis than many other people because many of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us live on fixed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Incomes and many places were not built to accommodate disabilities, which narrow our choices for homes. We are seniors. We are 17% of all Alameda. We face much discrimination. We need housing protection. Like all renters, we need affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But unlike many renters, we can't so easily move away because finding work is so much harder for us. Moving involves complications arising from access and mobility issues. We have deep roots here in Alameda. Generations of families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Are affected by this. Whole families will be broken up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And our lives made unnecessarily harder. Let's stop greed from ruling our retreat.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Community and make all housing accessible to all people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I love it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here and I want to stay here active in my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Community. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Angela Hawk about Jason Buckley and then Gary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Mayor and vice mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Angela Hawk about I live on Bay Farm Island and I started the Alameda Runners Coalition and I'm here this evening to thank you for getting the rent review ordinance this far and that we're here tonight to hopefully finish it and provide a modicum'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of support to renters. Right now, unfortunately, over the summer, I've seen more and more people get displaced out of their homes. And this rent review ordinance does nothing to address 30 and 60 day notices to vacate. I'm seeing elderly people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm seeing seniors, single family, single parent homes. And at this point, they can't even afford to meet the 30% requirement to rent of their income for a new rental, even if they wanted to pay that extra money. If they wanted to pay three fourths of their income instead of 30%, they can't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the rental property agencies won't take them because they don't meet the requirement. And so what I'm trying to say to you is that the reason why all these renters are here tonight is because they are worried that this rent review ordinance isn't going to be enough.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really strongly encourage you guys or you all as the council to find additional solutions and keep the conversation going. This is a great first step, but it shouldn't be the last step. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Based on Buckley and then Grover Rudolph and then Gary Hart. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And good evening. I would just like to say, it seems that, you know, there's a lot of talk about collecting data, figuring out if there is a crisis. And while we're doing that, the crisis is turning into class warfare.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'People are getting pushed out of their homes. People are getting evicted given 60 days so they could jack up the rent by double. At some point, we have to just say no to this. Greed. It is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Naked greed.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And as a community, is this what we want? Do we want to be the community that just pushes people out so people can make more money? Not only do we need rent control, we need. Some kind of moratorium on rent increases and these evictions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If we want to stop our community from bleeding people. That's pretty much all I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Grover Rudolph.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Good. Good evening. What I want to caution you guys against what some of the other cities do in and around the country. I'm I happen to be in the middle of this sort of thing. I'm a property manager also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been a renter as well. And what I would encourage you to do is to not take a one size fits all approach in your city should be some sort of formula that you guys will utilize that balances.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Infrastructure, current needs and market forces. Just consider those things. When you take a one step fits all at once. One size fits all approach. End up with a lot more problems than you're going to want. And again, I don't have a dog in this particular fight, but I would encourage you to do something that takes into consideration'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a formula that's some sort of one size fits all, because it really creates more problems than you think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I'm a Gary. Do you have Gary? Looks like b a tr. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, mayor. Council members, thank you for reviewing this subject matter and trying to do something about it. Please excuse me. I'm not a public speaker, so I'll try my best here. But I've lived in Marina Vista apartments on the beach in since 1993, and our building just got purchased by the entity that also owns the summerhouse'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And within seven days of closing on August 12th, 20, about 25% of us were notified of a rent increase of about 30 to 50%. There hasn't been any work that's been done to the to the building, except for some work that maybe started today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But. This is a very huge amount and it seems to me like something needs to be done, some sort of ordinance to be put in place, to have some sort of fairness. I used to manage the building as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I managed the building from 2006 to 2013, and in my time of managing the building, I did manage to move the rent by. The rent rose by 25%. I was able to do this by. Basically renovating and fixing up the apartments for the new tenants coming in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Who knew what the rents were coming in. They were happy with that. They didn't have to raise the rents on any of the existing tenants. They didn't have to raise the rents on the elderly, didn't have to raise rent on anybody for like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to me, it seems like it can be a workable formula to be able to. Not have to raise the rents on people 30 to 50%. You know, that's going to displace a whole lot of people. I mean, it might even displace me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So of course I'm here to talk about it and hopefully you guys can do something about it. So hopefully you can keep the effort and maybe put some sort of fairness in place that just keeps companies that are coming in to just be fair to the, you know, to the tenants instead of just corporate greed, just jumping'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in and raising 30 to 50%. That's a huge amount. So I can understand that, you know, there needs to be some sort of an increase. But fairness, you know, in the past it's been like 10%. So anyway, that's what I wanted to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hopefully you can do something about this and continue the effort.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'SA three. I believe this is Sara Tariq and then Lucia and Jon Sullivan and then Jon Klein.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Hello.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So Southwest overnight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Here we are living in the same building. 2019 and. We are first generation here in this country. And my wife has breast cancer and I'm the only supporter in the family right now. And like Gary said, the resentment from the base line, whatever, we are paying it for 30 to 50%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is it is only unmanageable. We are not asking you sympathy, but I want you to do something about it, to fair to both parties, not just, you know, take the money. We can't even afford it. And also, you know, as a household provider, I'm having two part time jobs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If rent goes this, have within six months or after six months, it goes more higher than that. I mean, where are we going to live? So you guys consider this all and hopefully we are going to have some kind of resolution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A future rent control, please. We are. Just try to have one place. Nice place to come.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Speaking to the Mike Wilkinson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just want to you know, we are community, we are neighbors. And and we are we just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want a place we can come into the job and have a place. This is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My home. And we just try to, I don't know, have a consideration for all of us to have a rent control. Is is three four 500 depends of the people will be a lot of money in our building is a lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I mean very hard work, but right now I cannot even help or there's going to be a lot of. But to all of us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Jon Sullivan and then Jon Klein and then Linda Weinstock. And our last speaker will be our Minda Rocca. Unless we have another speaker.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Members of the council and city staff. I'm John Sullivan at housing provider, an employer and a taxpayer in Alameda. I very much appreciate your efforts and, you know, the energy that was devoted into getting this far, really, and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And updating our rent review process. As a housing provider. I've been involved in that process. True. There are some versions of it that I don't quite have of the new ordinance that we are proposing that I don't quite agree with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at least I had the opportunity to, you know, to debate its merits. One big exception, really, is, which is No paragraph six, dash 56 of the new proposed ordinance. And that's failure to participate. Failure to appear essentially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If a landlord. Is deemed to not be participating properly or whatever, and he not alone is deprived of his right to raise the rent, the rent that he feels justified in asking. But he's also can't put another increase in place for a whole year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Two years without a rent increase can be really hurtful. Now, that issue was never part of our discussions in the many, many meetings that we had. Essentially, the rent review board at that time was asked to submit their recommendations, their areas of concerns, and they came up with six, I believe, if my memory serves me right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recommendations and concerns and those six and only those six items were came on onto the table for discussion. We're allowed on to the table for discussion. No. It's obvious that the rent board did not consider that item a concern at that time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It somehow got in later. Maybe well-intentioned, yes, but clear it is necessities to deprive a landlord of an opportunity to impose and increase. And for a whole year. In order to maintain its property. It really is not, you know, not justified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. It appears that there's a legal challenge being initiated on that matter. This could cost our city thousands of dollars to defend as a taxpayer, as an employer in Alameda. I ask you to really please consider omitting this penalty portion or letting the ordinance go forward, but placing this penalty portion on hold to give your legal counsel'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an opportunity to speak to the plaintiff's counsel and. Try to work things out, get better legal opinion or whatever. Lawsuits, just like penalties, can be very divisive. Very divisive. In the spirit of mediation, I think that's what it's all about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we should work on that. But thank you for the opportunity to present my concerns this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. John Klein. Linda WINESTOCK. John Klein. Linda Weinstock WINESTOCK and then our Linda Graca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. My name is Linda Weinstock, and I'm. I want to thank everybody here on the council and the city of Alameda for all the hard work they've been doing. And and I hope that we can continue to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I came here tonight to tell my story. I've been here for almost seven years, and I've been a very active part of Alameda. And I'm very proud to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be a residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I moved here and I was.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Paying 1650 a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Month or a two bedroom. I am paying.'",
        "'speaker_8': '2950 now, just got a.'",
        "'speaker_2': '10% increase. And I was told I asked, what can I project? My husband just got his first Social Security check. What can I project for the next year?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was told.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A 15 to 25% increase next year. So they're already projecting where I live, a 15 to 25% increase and letting all of us know to expect that. And I just think this is just unreasonable.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's almost like they're asking me to leave.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're planning our exit plan. And I think that is horrible because I have given to Alameda everything I searched out for Alameda for six years. I found you. And now I feel like I'm being asked to leave.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All I have to say. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our is the last speaker we have. If you want to speak on this, please turn on your slip it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Evening. Good evening, Mayor. And everybody else.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And will you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Please, good friend of mine that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm actually going to be with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You. Could we ask you to pull the mic?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then if you could just say your name. I didn't get it. I mean, Doug Rasa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good friend that I'm going to be losing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Due to this. I came across.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An article now Me Beach. I asked the person who wrote it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If I can read it tonight, and he gave me permission to say, I'm going to be the narrator for John Michael Chiodo I'm not slaughtering his name. It says Rent increases. As you may.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or may not know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm a realtor, real estate broker of 18 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it breaks my heart that of many of my friends and people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are getting hit with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ridiculous rent increases. This has been going on for a couple of years now and I've remained kind of silent on the issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'While I have no answers, I do have a response to landlords that are doing this as the movement grows from tenant rights for tenant rights and rent controls from Alameda Rent Coalition, it is because a view that there is a fire burning in the renters bellies of Alameda causing him to organize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You will be the sole reason that rent control passes. It will be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your short term thinking and greed that will.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Affect the effect the majority of good and fair minded landlords in the city. I urge you to come to the table with to the city and the Alameda renters. He kind of like messed up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A little bit that Alameda renters coalition to work out a fair strategy for rent increases before you permanently screw yourselves and the rest of the property owners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your greed is not only affecting families, seniors and those soon to be retired, but also affecting small business owners of the city who rely on the expendable incomes of those individuals who go out and enjoy this city and what they have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What it has to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Offer. Huge rate increases will affect their ability to take kids out to eat, taking few classes, sports programs and even deny them of Tucker's ice remain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Cookie bath. You're causing a great deal of stress on families with children, seniors and children who help take care of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Their parents for short.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Term gain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when the market turns.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Against you, you will be locked into lower rates controlled by rent control. Based on your actions today to the Fair Property Owners, I urge you to be involved in these meetings being held with the city and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With the Renters Coalition. There are others that are going to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Decide the fate of your.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Investment and your rights based on your noninvolvement. This is a real problem and I urge everybody to get involved on both sides. There can be a mutually beneficial agreement, but if the good landlords do not come out and and work and fight against those landlords that are no longer living here or our our after short term gains'",
        "'speaker_3': 'will not only ruin the family orientated nature of the city, but also ruin the rights that you currently have as an owner. I urge renters. Rental agents. Property management.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Companies. To start the dialog with your owners to explain the consequences of their actions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not just financially, but to Alameda families to Knutsen. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have two more speakers. Definition. Definition. ARD and Christoph. Crystal Felder.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Good evening. My name is Stephanie Shannon. I am a longtime Alameda resident. I will confess, I did move to San Francisco for a minute and I came back. I am an educator. I am a consultant. I have been an active part of the Omni community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I served on the Alameda Slow Food Board where we did a lot of investment back into the community. When I was still around and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can barely afford to live here. I live in I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just received a 15% rent increase. And so the property management people who own my building or my.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The property living.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are not Alameda. They are stationed in or they're headquartered in New Jersey. So 40% of my take home pay is going to New Jersey. It's not coming back to Alameda. That $223 extra a month that is now going to New Jersey instead of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's not just a $223.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rent increase per month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is now leaving the city. It's that I have had to adjust my lifestyle. I have started teaching an extra class over at City College of San Francisco, which means that I am in town less often.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which means that I do not get to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Participate in the activities I want to do. It also means that I have adjusted my lifestyle so that I am spending less. Instead of going to monkey bars on Park Street to buy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My toddler, which is I was making a record. So he's gone now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But instead of buying him a toy at monkey bars, I now go on Amazon instead of buying him books. I think I go on to Amazon because I can buy them cheaper there instead of going and buying the produce box at Dan's produce.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I now go to Safeway or wherever I can buy sales, so I've really adjusted my whole lifestyle to accommodate this. And again, it's more than $223 a month extra.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is leaving the community. It is now my choices that I have to make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's a snowball effect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Again, it's more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Than a 15% increase. I have not worked at a place that that has given me a raise, a 15% raise annually. But that is where I'm having to dig in to find that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To establish a home for my family. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. There's still Felder and then Lisa. Brown. And those are our last speakers, I think. You want to speak on this? Please turn in your slip.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, honorable mayor. Deputy Mayor, my name is Crystal Felder. I live at 2019 Shoreline Drive. We've resided there since August of 2004, so we've been there about 11 years now. Recently we received a I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous on the door, just a piece of paper folded with things that are going to happen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The first one was a letter stating that the building had been bought by a new owner. They didn't put the owner's name on there. Then we got something saying that we would have to pay garbage and sewage and water.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then today they gave us something that said in 60 days we would have a rental increase. That was basically double what we're paying now. And then something else that said they were going to start doing renovations to the patio, we don't have a patio.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our window was right on the driveway. I wanted to show you if I can, why I think there should be a moratorium on the rent increases. Is it okay if I ask this to you? This is. Rather constant as far as the apartment that we live in, it comes regularly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's pretty bad. It comes up from the shower or the toilet, it comes up from the tub. And so I think the new owner should really invest in. Doing. I don't know what they do to stop that, but I think they should do something about that before they consider raising the rent of 40 or 50%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is John Klein.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, John Klein.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm in support of the ordinance. I live in Alameda. I don't have any horror stories, and I certainly hope that I won't. But I am a renter. But this actually doesn't go far enough. And there's a lot of stuff going on there other than rent increases that the landlords need to be watched.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They need to know they're being watched because their what the person there was. I was reading an issue where a new owner was back charging tenants for utilities, which is typically the landlord's responsibility. And so the tenants are going, what do we do?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What do we do? But in any case. But really what I want to say. So I was looking in the binder outside with the email that the correspondence you have, you have one from.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The San Jose Law. These are all opposed to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You have one from the San Jose law firm, one from Hayward residents, two from residents of Pleasant Hill, two businesses in Belmont, one from Castro Valley, one from San Leandro, one from the Rental Housing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Association in Hayward. One was unknown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Excuse me. And one was just simply a Bay Area housing provider.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was the majority of the correspondence you have in opposition. All except one speaker tonight is an Alameda resident and they've all been in favor of the ordinance. So you have to pick who you represent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And our last speaker, Lisa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi, I am Lisa Brown and I actually came to speak on another topic. So I'm not entirely prepared for this, but I'm I am a property owner here in Alameda and I have a two unit place and I live in the other unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I guess, I mean, you know, I, I feel for the people who are being displaced. Um, I, I don't think that all landlords are greedy. Um, and I would. I would offer the idea that this. Be there be some sort of an exemption for for smaller landlords?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I have one unit, so I'm and I live next door to those people. And if I have a problem with them, you know. Being loud and they're next door to me. I'd like to be able to get them out so that I can still live in my property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I am on both sides of the issue here, and I would just like some sort of a consideration for maybe four units or less that there there wouldn't be. And I haven't read the ordinance, so I don't know what it says, but.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, and I'm I'm not a wealthy person. I just happen to be able to use the FHA loan when the market was down. So I'm very lucky to be in the position that I'm in. But I, I would like for you to consider it to be specifically related to people with large number of units rather'",
        "'speaker_2': 'than all landlords. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank. She's our last speaker. Staff, did you have a presentation? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. So the action before you this evening, which is five Q and five are on the consent calendar is actually a second reading of two ordinances, one having to do with the rent review process and the other having to do with the formation and operations of the city's Rent Review Advisory Committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The ordinance was approved by this Council on July 21st on first reading. That action was the culmination of about a nine month community engagement process in which there was a community led initiative to work together to look at ways to strengthen the city's existing rent review process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The action before you this evening is to do a second reading of both of those ordinances, and if the ordinances are approved on second reading tonight, both ordinances would become effective on October 1st. So just a couple of things that I think might be useful to point out based on the public comment this evening is that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ordinance is not a rent control ordinance and people may, you know, have their views about whether that's a good or bad thing. But it is not a rent a rent control ordinance. It is an ordinance that is aimed at strengthening the city's rent review process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff really adhere to the spirit of the community engagement process. And what is reflected in the ordinance that was adopted on first reading in July reflects that that nine month process. It is not an accurate statement to say that if property owners violate the provisions of the ordinance, they cannot raise their rent for one year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That that's an overly broad statement. There are two instances in the ordinance where we talk about how rent increases are handled. And one is one of the new provisions is that all tenants must be given a notice of the city's availability of a rent review process when they receive notice of a rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if failure to notify a tenant of their right to access the rent review process is not provided, you cannot that rent increase notice can be a defense of you as a tenant or served with an unlawful detainer that that violation of the ordinance can be cured by a re notice seen with the proper notice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So there is no penalty about any delay of a rent increase for a year that the cure for that is to simply re notice properly and consistent with the ordinance. There is a second provision of the ordinance that does talk about the rent review process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If if a tenant desires to file a rent increase complaint form with the city for a hearing before our rent review advisory committee and a landlord decides not to participate in that process, then their decision not to participate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The consequence of that decision not to participate is that they cannot the rent increase they cannot increase the rent for one year. And if an unlawful detainer is filed, our ordinance becomes a basis for a defense in an unlawful detainer proceeding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in that one instance, if a landlord affirmatively decides that they are not going to participate in our mediation process, then there is a consequence in the ordinance. It is still a mediation process. The only obligation for the property owner is to participate in the mediation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The landlord does not have to comply with the the direction or the determination of the Rent Review Advisory Board. It's strictly voluntary. So as long as they participate, they then have the ability to have their rent increase stand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what we are doing is implementing the recommendations that came from the process in the community that involve property owners and tenants. And we have to, as staff, have respected that process and captured that the outcomes of that process in this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's that's where we at. That's the genesis of the two ordinances that are before you this evening. The other thing that the council directed staff to do in July was to do some additional research about three items that were raised by the Renters Coalition in July, where they asked that we study the more to a moratorium'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on rent increases, that we look at inspections when rent increases are given. We got that direction from council and council asked us when we come back with our report at the end of the year about the impacts of rising rents on tenants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will be addressing those issues per council's direction at that same time. So we will be continuing. This is an ongoing discussion, clearly a huge. Issue here in Alameda. And lastly, the ordinance does have a provision that we as staff report back to the Council on an annual basis about the effectiveness of the rent review ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we will be coming back first at the end of this year with our with our report on the impact of rising rents on Alameda residents and on the three issues that the Renters Coalition asked the Council to address in July.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then six months later, we will be coming back. If the ordinance goes into effect might be a little more than six months. If the ordinance becomes effective October one. We will then be reporting back next year on the data and kind of an analysis of how the ordinance has been working over these 12 months, if it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'adopted. So that's some context for the audience and for the council, and then I'm happy to answer any questions in addition. Michael Rausch from the City Attorney's Office, who's been working with us on this, is here. And I might just add one more thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That council also directed us in May to do a legal analysis about the validity of the ordinance. And we reported back in July with a very comprehensive analysis of the legal validity of the ordinance, and the Attorney's Office has opined that this ordinance meets all of the requirements of state law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So staff continues and council reflected the confidence in that legal opinion by introducing this ordinance on first reading in July. So we as a staff do feel confident about the legality of of the ordinance. That's before you for a second reading this evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Thank you, Miss Potter, for your remarks. That was some of the most emotional testimony I've heard in this chamber in a lot of years of serving on the council in different bodies. And I appreciate everything that you're working on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm confident that we're going to pass a to do our second reading of these two measures before us. One of the things I wonder, and maybe this is already part of your work plan, but are we looking at what is being done and what is working in other cities to address these problems?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know Alameda is not alone, but as we say more than once, we shouldn't need to reinvent the wheel if there's something, something more that can be done. I'd like that to come back to council when you report back to us at the at the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. That is part of the work plan, part of the review. The report that we're doing on the impact of rising rents will be looking at best practices about the issue of, you know, the adverse impacts of very large rent increases on the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was just ready to move approval. But maybe there's other comments. Well, do we want to do the motion and then come in or how would you like to do that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I propose first we look at five.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Q Are we making comments after a motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We could, yes, I'll hold.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Off. If you want to make comments now, you could.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. I can make them now, so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's make them now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doyle has the sign there. I rent and I vote. I rent and I vote. So I totally understand all of the issues that have been raised today. Before doing what I do now, I was a landlord tenant attorney, and as Councilmember Ashcraft said, this was a very emotional thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the legal profession, you know, I think the only thing that's worse emotionally than landlord tenant dispute is a family law dispute. So we're talking about a basic need and that's a basic need of housing. So. You know, I didn't say this last time and maybe I should have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a little disappointing that this came to the council. You know, I wasn't here. I don't think anybody up here voted for this path last September. And it'll be 15 months before we have data on on the extent of the problem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, that's really disappointing to me that, you know, we had an opportunity to address the issues and the concerns that the tenants have been raising. And, you know, it hasn't happened. And we still have to wait another three months to get that information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know. Each time we discuss this, more and more people come out. So I'm beginning to wonder, you know, in my head as I think about this, is this, you know, isolated to 30 or 40 people or do we have a larger problem?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I hear more and more people say I'm getting the 30 and 60 day notices. You know, Linda. 25% this year and 25% next year. I mean, that's that's obscene. Okay. And I'll say it. So for tenants, you know, I apologize to tenants for what we're going to do today because it really doesn't move the needle'",
        "'speaker_5': ', I think, where it needs to be moved. This is I think it's a good thing that we're going to have notice and that more tenants are aware of their rights and maybe we'll take advantage of the process. But all landlords have to do is show up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, they don't have to mediate. I mean, they don't have to lower the increase. They don't have to listen to that to the the rent poor. They don't have to listen to the counsel. So we haven't really done anything to stop these egregious rent increases.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that's really disappointing to me that we don't have something in front of us that we can do. So, I mean, tenants, you all a lot of you talked about rent control. This isn't rent control. We haven't talked about just cause eviction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we haven't talked about moratoriums. We haven't talked about rent control. But I will say to the landlords. You're pretty lucky that this is all we're doing. And without having the one year delay, if you fail to show up, there's no tooth teeth to this ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's no teeth. And all you have to do is show up. Come to the meeting, come to mediate, and you can get what you want. I don't know. I can't see where that's a burden. I can't see where that's a burden on landlords to come to one meeting and get what they want.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm not sympathetic to those complaints where if you don't show up to the mediation, you don't get a chance to raise rents after another year. So one thing I will say to the landlords. If it turns out that the 30 or 40 people that we keep hearing from are are not isolated, if they're a part of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'a bigger pattern of massive 30, 60 day notices, if they're a part of a pattern of massive ten, 15, 20% increases, this council is going to be forced to act. And if we fail to act, 51% of our voters, our citizens, our tenants, they will either kick us out or they will put something on the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And what they will put on the ballot will probably be far worse for landlords than anything we could put together. So if you're doing this, if you're giving out these massive increases, if you're routinely evicting people with 30 or 60 day notices.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Stop doing it. Be reasonable, because we are watching. The tenants are watching. The council is watching. And I'll be really interested to see the data that we see back in December. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ashcroft Thank you. I, um, I endorse everything my colleague, council member Odie just said. I wrote in my margin as people were talking and I even lost track of how many speakers did we have?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Roughly 19. We're hearing alarming reports of extreme rent increases in Alameda. The council needs to take action on these two measures tonight. That's what's before us. But trust us, we've heard what you said. I know there are people I've gotten your emails who are impatient.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They don't want us to wait for data. Just act as do something. Now, whatever a resolution is will be better and sounder and more effective with data to rely on. And we have a very competent staff working on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I also want to address the issue of the one year suspension of a grant. I was a little surprised that the attorney for the apartment house owners raised that because I know he's talked to our city attorney and knows that it passes legal muster.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and, in fact, those same provisions are in place in other cities in the Bay Area, Fremont and San Leandro. And they have been in place for decades. What I noticed in the last term on the city council was we had two instances that happened in fairly close proximity where there was an egregious rent increase.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A couple of them, two different properties. And the landlords just didn't they didn't come to the hearing. Then they're called to come before the city council. They didn't come to the the city council. They said, we don't have to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One of them sent their attorney and said, We read the ordinance. We don't have to come now. It's not a panacea. But one thing we do find and in the mediation process is that if you can at least get parties to the table to sit down face to face and look each other in the eye and hear'",
        "'speaker_8': 'about the things we heard about today, which is what I would call the impact that this is having on people's lives. It's possible that you can reach some middle ground. It's a whole lot more possible than if the the landlord and it's not by the way, and a level playing field because the landlord has everything the tenant'",
        "'speaker_8': 'needs. So that's all we're asking. It's very reasonable if you're an out of state landlord. The provision also says you can send an agent, but that agent has to have authority to act and better come prepared to enter into an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you're just going to sign us off, if you're just going to blow us off as has happened before. Then you lose. If you don't show up, you won't get to increase your rent for a year. And that's completely reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then I just want to end with quoting Angela Hawk about and I'm also very moved and impressed that so many of you have gotten together in this organization of the Renters Coalition. And I know there's Facebook groups and there's a lot of communication, and I want to encourage the landlords.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We know there's good, decent landlords out there. Don't let the bad apples label you get in there and make the difference that you're able to make. But Angela, talk about said this, these ordinances that we're about to vote on tonight, they're a good first step, but they shouldn't be the last.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I couldn't agree more. Thanks, everyone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Member j soc.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much. Thank you very much to everyone who came out took the time to share their situation. I think it certainly is indicative that members who are raising their rents were not here, but that the tenants who live here in Alameda are here because you're turning to the city council for not just support but for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'action. I think tonight is a first step. It's not enough, but it's a first step. Ultimately, as I had indicated in talking with members who are affected by the rental increase, I want to see stronger steps. You know, I want to see specific language with regard to just cause eviction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to see specific language with regard to moratorium on prices. Now, I think we here in the city of Alameda, we're going to lose something if we lose a lot of the tenants who are here. You guys are the ones who have made Alameda a dynamic place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we're not just, you know, some affluent Silicon Valley town. We're a town that does have that. But it also has a working class. It has young adult, it has older adults, and we're going to lose that flavor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we need to take action. You know, all of you know that, you know, I have my twice office hours and I to me, you know, the number of people who come out and let me know that their rent increases is just coming down mean I know that it's a crisis already.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not about gathering data. The facts are in front of us, in front of and in the faces of that people and the stories that they have to tell my neighbors, Gina and Steve, now, they had to move out of town because their landlord who lives in Kensington, you know, jacked up their rent, all because once again'",
        "'speaker_7': ', when I got better tenant, you know, at Farmer's Market, you know, someone came by and told me that, you know, she's active in the church and also she's affected by a huge rent increase. A neighbor of my good friend on Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's happening across town and we're really losing a significant part of our town. So I look forward to passing was before us right now, but I also look forward to specific action. And, you know, I want to see I want to make a vote up or down.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With regard to living wage, earner living wage, with regard to just cause evictions as as well as any temporary moratorium, some kind of emergency trigger that that councilors or the mayor can pull in times of crisis, emergency triggers, as opposed to, you know, something that's lasting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But maybe we have to do something that's lasting. I don't know. But we need we need specific action because we're losing people right now and it's sad. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I swear I'm ready for the vote right now. It's. We've heard that there should be some changes as well. We can always evaluate as we have this ordinance in effect for the next six months and see if those changes are warranted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also, any decision that's made at the Rent Review Advisory Committee is appealable to the council, so there's no reason to delay this. Let's take this step. Things. The stories are getting worse.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Protect it. The matter of fairness in business here in the city of of people who rent and people who are providing houses, it's got to be fair. I also heard that Santa Rosa City Council is also looking they're looking at rent control.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think the speakers alluded to the fact that people better start acting fairly. Otherwise, there's going to be there's going to be a groundswell of action similar to what we're seeing in other cities. I'd also like our representatives to League of California Cities to push this issue to see what the league is doing because it affects'",
        "'speaker_6': 'every city in California. Again, I'm ready for the vote now. I think we should pass this both ordinances at this moment. Yes, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member de.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sa madam, I'd like to pass make motion adopting the first item as the second reading.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a second.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll second that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's five Q But correct. Okay. Five. Q I wanted to speak to that. It defines the base rent as other than fees or charges for utilities paid directly to the housing provider. And a concern I have it's been raised as it's my understanding and we had to speak one speaker us to that at least one this'",
        "'speaker_0': 'evening that landlords are passing along more charges, whether it's for utilities, electricity, sewage, things like that. And I'm not sure how we can where that can come in, but that can also be a significant increase. That is a new increase, even though it's not defined as part of our definition here on base rent.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would propose that can we include utilities in that definition?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, doesn't the paragraph say, Madam City Attorney, help me out? Or I guess it is Mr. Roush So I'm reading this is under section page two of our staff report. You know, page two of the staff report, section six, dash 57.2 Definitions based rent means the rental amount, including any amount paid directly to the housing provider for'",
        "'speaker_8': 'parking, storage or any other fear charge associated with the tenancy other than fees or charges for utilities paid directly to the housing provider. I wasn't clear whether the speaker who charged was saying that there were now the tenants were being required to pay directly to pay junior or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But perhaps you can clarify that terminology for us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor, members of the council, Michael Roche. What? The city attorney's office here in Alameda. I think the concern that if if we were to do sort of as a procedural matter, if we were to change that tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We would then have to reenter and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Reintroduce it tonight, have a second reading, and that would cause some delay. So leaving that issue aside, I think the idea here with the with the definition was that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the if the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tenant is paying the utility directly to the landlord, then that would not be included. It's only when the utilities are sort of embodied within the the rent that the tenant is paying. We can certainly come back. And when we bring back the the report in December, take a look at that definition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If if that issue is arising and causing a problem, we can certainly fine tune that a little better to try to deal with the issues that have been voiced here tonight by our residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've also received, I believe, emails or other communications of, for instance, a landlord taking the total amount of the water bill because they don't have individual water to the homes. And then they divide that by the number of people and they just demand that they pay that now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe there's other utilities that are these new charges to tenants in the past the landlord has absorbed. So this is a new this this seems to be another tactic that we're seeing of landlords being able to charge additional moneys to tenants that are already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Feeling, you know, that they're being over having too it's too much. Too much. So if we can address this, look into that issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is certainly some law with respect to mobile home parks, with respect to that issue, in terms of requiring sub metering so that the you know, if you if you're using more utility than your next door neighbor, you shouldn't be you should be paying for your charge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll have to take a look at whether or not that is as applicable with respect to residential rental units. I'm just not sure that answer, as I said, or stand here tonight, but we would certainly look at that as part of the report we bring back in December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if you could also look at that, which I appreciate. Thank you. And also making I've also heard of a landlord of making it retroactive, going backwards and saying that they have utilities that have not been paid and charging tenants to make to make them whole.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you look into that issue also or would you have an opinion in regards to the legality of retroactivity on something like that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilmember It was probably much more well versed in that issue than I am. I don't know the answer to that, but we certainly can take a look at that as to whether or not a retroactive application can be applied.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It certainly seems somewhat suspect, but without without delving into the weeds with respect to that issue, I wouldn't be able to answer that definitively today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Did you have I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just want to say, I think the points that Mayor Spencer is raising is important, because what she's what is really getting at is whether we're going to define rent in terms of gross rent or we're going to define it as the, you know, the cash contract rent for purposes of affordable housing policymaking.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's really the gross rent that is always used in terms of defining people who are at or below the 30% threshold. So in a way, it is correct to somehow take into account utilities for those who have to pay utilities and for those who don't have to pay utilities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So gross rent is a rent plus zero, whatever the utility says. The only careful thing you need to watch out, though, is that whatever language that you have, utilities is always going to change from month to month, season to season.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, you know, somehow that nuance has to be incorporated, but I think we could certainly catch it later this year. But by the same token, you know, if we can start on a lot of other things, too, that people are concerned about, like just cause eviction and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also wanted to thank Jeff Canberra as well as all the tenants and landlords that participated in the multiple hearings that resulted in this. I also want to acknowledge that I believe that there's been a change in the landscape, if you will, and I'm not sure if we looked back that we would be arriving at this solution'",
        "'speaker_0': ', quote unquote solution today. There. I am also a renter. I will share. I've been renting the same home for 16 years. Under. Costa Hawkins single family homes are not and would not be affected by rent control. Many of us do rent single family homes in this town.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one thing that this this approach goes to is trying to address all renters and under Costa Hawkins. And that's something that I encourage all of you to look at, anyone that. There are exclusions to it. And that's the state legislation and it excludes from rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Currently in the state of California, single family homes and apartments that were built after 1995. This is Brian, it's my understanding. One. One thing you see sometimes is condo conversions because then you end up with essentially a single family home from an apartment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there are responses. So at this point, I will be supporting I'm confident this will pass this this. This ordinance that is really goes to mediating. However, when we see these increases, for instance, $650, up to 2900, and I can tell you, my landlord and I know many local landlords are not doing this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have a serious problem here and that that's been alluded to as we have. But I'm going to call out of town onwards that. Don't really seem to be to to to care. If you will, what our about our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is a serious problem. Of our local landlords are trying are trying very hard to help mediate this from what I've seen. And I want to give them credit for that. So this is a step. However, when we see these large increases from apartments that could be addressed through rent control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As well as the 30 to 60 day notices to vacate. We have a problem. So going back to what I had said earlier, I, I don't believe I'm I can't help but think that we would be asking for more concessions at this point if we were looking at the current landscape, which means this does need to circle'",
        "'speaker_0': 'back sooner rather than later. We do need all of the tenants who renters. If you're experiencing these increases, you need to strongly consider taking advantage of the rent review advisory committee. We want you to use that process and then we encourage the landlords to also participate in that process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have attended those meetings and many of the cases are resolved. It is they it is taken seriously. And cases cases are resolved. There is resolution. It's not all of the cases, but a significant number. And that's actually what we're hoping that we will see, especially now, is that we want where we want more of the'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And so that is a means that is can impact all of our renters can fall under that. So it's a way for us to address every renter with the cooperation of our landlords. So this this like others have said, this is a step.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The concern is that. We are paying someone to be here now for this, and we'd rather do it at the next meeting because we have all these other items. If that would be the two speakers that are. I think there's two speakers.'",

Adam prior to the Park Commission and Chris Smiley to the Transportation Commission.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And then it comes to council to vote whether or not to approve my nominations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, city council and city staff. My name is Donna Alvarez and I'm a lifelong resident of Alameda. I submitted a letter to the city clerk late this afternoon, and I would like to read it so that it can be a matter of public record.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dear Council members to serve on the Planning Board is an honor and a privilege and a wonderful way to perform one's civic duty. I consider myself quite fortunate to have experienced this type of community service firsthand, and for that I will be forever grateful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It became clear during my days as a planning board member that those appointed to the Planning Board should have an ability to listen to opposing views while keeping a clear focus on where the real public interests lie. What was not only within the law, but also really fair, and the ability to distinguish between fact and opinion with'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the position one needed to assemble information from both written and oral testimony and apply it to the making of meaningful recommendations that were based upon adopted plans, ordinances, required findings of fact and established policies, and not upon personal values.'",

Specifically the comment made in the other comments section of Ms.. Sullivan's application. I am not a realtor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I found this comment unnecessary and inappropriate, and because I am a realtor personally offensive. In some cities, it is a requirement that at least one of the members of a planning board commission be a representative from a community group that participates in land use issues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On a personal note, and as a lifelong Alameda resident, I believe in individual. Taking a leadership position on a city board should not make disparaging remarks towards other members of the community as a validation of their qualifications. To appoint an individual that demonstrates the same attitude is not the best interest of our residents in our city.'",

But I think that having the history of what was before, along with what is going to happen, is critically important because you know, that word seamless and things like that is a crock.

I currently sit on the planning board and past president of the planning board and have sat on several city commissions. I've done a lot of volunteer work for the city and I'm very concerned about the process that's happened for this nomination, because I feel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that it is a process of intimidation for sitting volunteers on every board. It has been the practice of mayors in this town for as long as I recall. In almost every case, members are reappointed to the board when they're up for a term and they apply for the reappointment to the term.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They respect all of the efforts that those volunteers have made in serving their city. And if those volunteers want to continue, if there has not been misconduct, they typically extend that. It's been very rare that that does not happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason I think that that happens in many cases is because mayors understand that volunteers give up a lot of their time, a lot of their energy and a lot of their resources. I know I personally put several hours into the planning board activities every week and have for the past several years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know when member Marilynn as you Ashcraft was on the planning board, I know she put me to shame bicycling to every single location across the island and spending time to talk to all the neighbors.

        "'speaker_2': 'of insulation. There are a lot of ordinances, a lot of plans, a lot of guides. There's a lot of history. You have to understand what it is you're charged with implementing. It is not a matter of personal opinion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are restrictions on what it is that you can do and say, what you can provide as guidance, what is legal, what can what you might do that could cost this city a significant amount of money. It really requires a lot of startup time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It requires a lot of staff time to disrespect all of the effort that a good performing member puts into a council or commission is really, in my opinion, a matter of bullying because the reason those members are typically excluded is because they have expressed an opinion or a point of view that is not aligned with the person'",
        "'speaker_2': '. It suppresses expression on all of the boards because, you know, if you speak out of line with the mayor who's appointing the members, you won't be reappointed.

        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. John Knox White. I am a current planning board member. I have two reasons for being here. First, I want to just give thanks to Donya for her for her service. I was disappointed that she has not been renominated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She has. You know, a year and a half ago she was along with me and president at the time, David Burton. Every other week at 7 a.m., we were here at City Hall, the city staff working on the two point plan for two and a half months.'",

In fact, actually, I think it's very good that we are reevaluating the process for nominating the nominating process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The nominating process, I would say, is the charter is clear. The mayor nominates I would I would correct what was said a little earlier. The charter is also clear that the council appoints the planning board. The council appoints our commissions.'",

And I'm here to say, as a part of the shaking up of this process and throwing tradition out the window to encourage the council to really, you know, take on that role in a way that they haven't for many, many years.'",

So far there have been two appointments that did not require City Council or City Council approval for the Sunshine Committee and for the Rent Advisory Committee. And the appointment from the mayor at the Sunshine Committee is a person who just last month said that he thought the Brown'",

I'm a 15 year resident of the city of Alameda and a neighbor of Dan Alvarez and ordinances. I move to Alameda and have come to value her neighborliness and her knowledge of the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda is going through a great deal of change. And I can tell you that I've seen quite a bit of it. 15 years ago, I couldn't see moving on on the island. The residents of Park Street were nothing to write home about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also, I think Alameda has started the the school district's enrollment started to start to decline. And obviously now it's been exacerbated by my entire day in Alameda going to movie shopping, having lunch and dinner. And now enrollment in the schools is almost 11,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know that there are a lot of challenges going on as well with Alameda. As we know, people are concerned about transportation, traffic, overcrowding and as you've heard, rising rents. And at this critical point, I think it's important that we have people who are on the planning board, who are experts on, you know, on on Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and, Don, you're really being brings a lifetime of experience and expertize to to to the to the planning board. She has she's studied and worked internationally. She's proven herself as a professional who looks out for the best interests of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She seeks collaboration and strives for solutions that are fair to all. She has deep knowledge of the real estate market and the impact of development on the quality of life in Alameda. She thoroughly prepares for meetings. She listened to those on both sides of an issue and is valuable by members of the commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, as we as we as we've heard, El Camino will always change. No one can stop that to optimally, optimally deal with this change and to enable controlled growth. We need experts like Daniel Alvarez. And I ask the mayor and the city council to consider permitting Daniel Alvarez to continue her work with the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Christopher Koster, then my Canterbury and then Nancy Garden. And if you'd like to speak on this issue, please turn in your slip.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening, dear mayor. Vice Mayor, City Council members. Come or come before you tonight to ask that you reappoint a member of the Planning Board who would like to continue doing the great volunteer work she has been doing tirelessly for the last few years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Just a few years ago when I myself joined the planning board, the board was badly in need of volunteers who would want to join council. Councilwoman, as he asked Gaffney, attest to her being president of the board for an extended period of time as the board didn't even have enough members at the time in order to hold'",
        "'speaker_9': 'elections. I myself was asked to join the board after I had applied in 2010, but as luck would have it, I started a new job with a different architectural firm and position. My elects are postponed my election to the board for one year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The spot was still available one year to the date I filled someone's vacant spot and now I serve on my own, only my first term. Since then, we've been fortunate enough to have the full board to assist the city in delicate decisions for future development design review and decide on amendments to the City Charter Code and design'",
        "'speaker_9': 'guidelines. For each of these aspects, Danny Alvarez has tuned to what's going on in Alameda and often raises concerns that she has with new projects when she disagrees with, often sparking debate among the board members. She has been an asset to the board and the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Having a background in real estate, as you know, has provided her with the skills and understanding current market about current market rates, housing needs and affordability issues. Finally, in just a short period of time at the board, Danielle has risen to the position of VP on the board, which has to stand for something here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Again, I urge you to keep Daniela Alvarez on the board at this critical time in Alameda history as we gear up to work together on Alameda Point and other great future Alameda projects. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Mike Canterbury. I'm a lifelong Alameda resident, and I'm president of the Planning Board. I'm here this evening to discuss the mayor's nominations for the planning board. Actually, more succinctly. I'm here to discuss an appointment. The mayor did not put forward that of current Vice President Tonya Alvarez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It has been the practice in Alameda for mayors, nominations to various boards and commissions to be authorized by the council with little or no discussion. Although in my case, I must admit, I garnered a no vote when I was appointed to the Planning Board.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's also been the past practice of mayors to reappoint board members who are eligible to serve out additional terms. In my particular case, I harbor no illusions that I'll be reappointed. But I'm a political person. I can live with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I don't understand, what I'll never understand is why an eligible person completely qualified like Donna Alvarez, is not being reappointed. She's basically an apolitical person. She does her homework. She works with every issue that comes before the board to the envy of its members.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you've been to one of our meetings, as most of you have, you know, we have some very detail oriented folks, so that's quite a complement. Her credentials as a caring, committed Alameda. Alameda are unparalleled. Everybody knows a story of her family overcoming huge odds after becoming Cuban exiles after Castro took over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If anyone understands a call to service and the obligation to serve, it's Tanya Alvarez. What this non appointment does is send a message to members of boards and commissions that we don't care how well you served or how hard you worked or how committed you are to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you're appointed by someone we don't like, you're out. It looks to me like the only thing Donya Alvarez is guilty of is being appointed by Mary Gilmore. As I said earlier, I understand your prerogative. I also understand that if the rules are going to be changed, throwing out the past practice of reappointing previous mayoral appointments, then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the council has an obligation to assert itself. In this case, the mayor's put two Ford, two names instead of rubber stamping the appointments. The council should stand up, evaluate the applications and vote accordingly. In a situation where the mayor has the ability to make appointments over her term to reflect her views.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The council has to take a stand. There are many appointments that are going to be made over the next three and a half years. It would be completely reasonable to reappoint Alvarez and then reappoint one of the mayors suggested appointees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Daniel Alvarez does not deserve to be collateral damage in a political calculation. Those voting need to explain why they're taking their positions. In Alameda tradition die hard. The mayor and the council are treading new ground here, and I urge you to be very careful and cautious.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your time.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor Spencer, Vice Mayor, Metro, AC and Council. Thank you so much for your outstanding service to our wonderful city. I became aware of this not from my business partner at the office, Donna, but from the article in the paper by Mr. Hanna.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Barry and I went, Well, this doesn't seem to make sense to me. So I did a little bit more research.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I just want to speak incredibly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Positively for Donna Alvarez. I chose her to be my partner at the office to take care of my real estate clients when I'm not there. I totally trust her. She goes beyond the call of duty. She does more than just her homework that she needs to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She thinks beyond the box. Outside the box. She's way more techie than I am. And to rely on that. She wants to go beyond what people might ask.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And anticipate what they may need to know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I've seen her in action, and I've appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Her quality of leadership and her integrity. She was the president of the Board of Realtors, as most of us know, did an excellent job. She's just an exemplary person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I was very pleased to come to a recent planning board meeting and hear all of you speak and hear Donya speak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On the project. I think we're the island high schoolers, and the architectural drawings didn't seem to be popular with anybody, gratefully, but I could see.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That there's a lot of conscious consideration of what's going on in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In line with.'",

The Recreation and Parks Commission. And the Transportation Commission. And then separate out the Planning Board until we have a chance to talk to the to the individual nominees and then have a deliberation.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. No, she's here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is she the only. Only one of the two?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, Mr. Mitchell.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is her, too. Okay, great. So I don't know. Does anyone else want to ask questions or. Because maybe we should have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I have some comments to make, but you can if you. It's up to the mayor. I, I can wait to make my comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just like to, you know, kind of judge some of their, you know, how they go about making decisions on the planning board and know I don't care if I ask one, one, one set of questions than one the other, it doesn't really matter to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm not. As far as I know, this is unprecedented. However, it is not unprecedented for the mayor not to reappoint everyone that had been appointed in the past.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand that. But we do have a responsibility to actually make the appointments and confirm them. So, you know, I did not have the opportunity to have a discussion behind closed doors with any of these these candidates. So I'd like to, you know, have that discussion here in public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not sure how this works. Anyone want to weigh in on how we could do this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Madam Mayor? Well, at this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would encourage that we at least hold off on the appointments to the Planning Commission so that council members who so decide can have the time to meet the nominees. That would be my recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, then I'd like to make a comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I'd like to do that in public. I mean, this is, you know, we're going to have a referral on this later if we get to that point on the agenda. But and this is the most important board and commission in the entire city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think the public has a right to hear the philosophy of what people that will be making important decisions affecting everyone's future, whether it be traffic or development or anything like that here in public in a transparent manner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I mean I'd like to go ahead and ask my questions if was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's impressive as far as I know. Are there other councilmembers that would support doing it in public but in that manner?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm of two minds. Did the did the applicants have notice that this was going to occur? And Ms.. Sullivan's indicated she has no problem addressing questions and. And Mr. Mitchell says it's fine as well. So. STAFF Is there any problem with this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Any issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Let's continue. So did you want both of them diverge at this point?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not going to ask different questions of each one or. Okay. US the same beach. Yeah. Maybe we can just come up and then alternate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm Sandy Sullivan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you are?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. Mitchell, I'm David Mitchell.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for coming, and I appreciate you being amenable to answering some questions. So, you know, I can feel comfortable with your nominations so you can pick who's going to go first. But I think the first question is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, housing affordability is an issue of great interest and concern here in Alameda. What do you feel is the Planning Board's role in maintaining affordability, and how would you propose the board do so?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, that's a very good question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just lost my son, my grandson and my daughter in law to Folsom because of the affordable housing issue here in Alameda. So it is a concern. I am not fully versed on what the solutions should be. I am a person that believes that property owners have certain rights and tenants have certain rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think you've made a good first step and we'll see how it goes. It may not be nearly enough, and I like the idea of seeing what best practices are across other cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. I think the best way to handle affordable housing is to look at new construction that's happening in condos and things that are going in the city and making possibly certain percentages of that. Those homes are affordable. That's one way to look at it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then I think another way to address it is to, of course, look at to see what other cities are doing and see what works best with a community like ours. With. With. Similar populations, that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Maybe we'll just switch so you have a chance to think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can you kind of explain your understanding of the role of the planning board?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, well, so the role of planning board is to, you know, approve projects that are happening throughout the city. My particular philosophy is, you know, I'm for growth, but I'm for smart, sustainable growth. I want to keep Alameda charming.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I'm a basically a resident first and foremost. And I live here for a reason. And I want to keep Alameda a really good place to live. And, you know, that's where I'm coming from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have lived on both sides of the island. I started my stint in Alameda on the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'West.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Side as a younger person. I now live in Harbor Bay and I've been in this location about 24 years. The planning board is a really critical role in in in the city and what it is and the character of the city, because it makes the decisions that are going to determine what the city is like in years'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ahead, long past our terms. And I think based on my background in the kind of work I have done in that I can be an asset to this and to the planning board and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Q So how would you adjudicate on an issue that you might philosophically, philosophically disagree with, but there is no legal reasoning that would allow you to vote against it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it would if there's no legal reason that you can't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Still vote.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Against it. I mean, I like to think of myself as a very open person. I have a lot of experience dealing with the public and dealing with issues. And I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, I like to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look at both sides. I like to do my homework. I like to do some investigation from the standpoint of getting feedback from other publics that are involved or would be impacted. And that's how I work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. I would just address it with, um, not wanting to bog the city down. Of course, in litigation that could be really problematic as well. But trying to also put Alameda first and any decisions that they do make.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then, you know, this kind of a two parter, you know, what do you think was a good decision made by the planning board in the last year and why? And what was the decision made by the planning board that you would have made differently?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And why and how would you work with your fellow board members to create that consensus? What kind of good and bad and how you would get people to change their mind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the good is that we are getting some exciting things happening in the city and some new building going on. I think if if you asked me an example of of less than optimal, I would use Bayport as an example.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I spend a lot of time out there visiting friends. I don't know if any of you have gone on Easter or Thanksgiving Day with a car full of food and there's no place to park because most people use.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Their.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Garages as aboveground basements and so they are parked on the street. So parking in that development is a huge, huge issue. I would say there were some things that could have been done design wise that would have added more parking without destroying the ambiance of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that would be the one thing that would have been done better.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. For me, I think the the Del Monte Project, you know, the parking obviously could be problematic and that's criticism. And I think I would look at another issue that maybe hasn't come before, but is the Harbor Clubs a very interesting issue?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think most people support leaving it where it is. Um, so to the two issues that I recently looked at that I thought were very interesting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do you have an opinion on that Harbor Bay Club?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I. I don't think I would.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You don't want.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To really.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You don't want to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Say what's going to come before me? And I don't have an opinion because I believe, you know, some of some of the opinions have been expressed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, yeah, I would want to look review all the material before I would make a public announcement about that particular property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was thinking the city attorney might want to weigh in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think what you have heard here is you cannot express an opinion on something that might be coming before you. So I think that's a clear direction that needs to be thought about and addressed. And I think maybe one of council member Otis questions was kind of directed that way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a problem in prejudging.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And having firm opinions before you have the facts.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before you that could cause you to recuse yourself from.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And I appreciate you sharing that. And in asking it that way, I think that that would have been nice to include that in your question. Well, it's important that we be fair here. Thank you. Member de started you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Guess I am now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, the question that I have just for both of you if you can just. Well, first of all, let me say thank you very much for submitting your application to serve. I will say this much, though, that Dana Macedonia Alvarez, she did a yeoman's work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I would have preferred that she be nominated because of the work that she had done substantively and procedurally, the way in which she worked. The charter is clear, though, that it is the mayor prerogative to nominate. It make nominations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So and generally, when we get the packets, we get the backgrounds of the persons, you know, the things that you fill out. So if you could just for the public, just kind of give us, you know, the 62nd summary of who you are, you know, how long have you lived in Alameda for the public?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any pertinent background? That's all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've lived in Alameda all total.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a long track record in in my community of providing surf service, volunteer service. I spent six years on the Architectural Committee for the Community of Harbor Bay, all 3000 homes and only left when I termed out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have been chairman and am chairman of the Landscape Committee for Bal Point and it has 14 parks and integrating three landscaping plans into existing infrastructure has been a major project. I have also served on the Bal Point Board of Directors a total of four different times, twice as President, and have been responsible for a number of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'initiatives and policies that have put the association in a firm financial footing, as well as brought some new thinking and some new ideas and to to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Board. So in a nutshell, my child was raised in Alameda, attended Alameda schools.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I like it here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi. My name is David Mitchell. As you know, I, um, I've lived in Alameda about ten years. I represent the new blood of Alameda. Really? I have five year old twins that just started Otis in kindergarten on Monday.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my my idea was to try to interject some new blood into the planning board and into volunteering here. Um, I currently own a company that produces, um, luxury home decor items and everything is manufactured in Oakland. Um, so I do have a background in design and also work really closely with architects and contractors on projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know how to do CAD drawings and drawings and using computer graphics, which is like illustrator and things. Um, I, I just have a real interest in seeing aluminum continue to prosper and grow and just do it in a very smart, sustainable way that makes sense for everyone that lives here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions? Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just one for Ms.. Sullivan. Could you help us understand why you included the sentence in your application? I am not. And you underlined not a real person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It had nothing to do with Donna. Donna, I didn't even know you were a real estate agent. It had to do with my beliefs that in some of these boards and commissions. Well, there are certain parts of being a realtor can be an asset.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's certain other parts that can be a conflict. And that's a personal feeling. And I felt it was important to say that I had no connections to any realty firm or developer. I'm really interested in representing the residents of Alameda that the character of this town and the what's important to residents is integrated with all the new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'opportunities and new building that is coming forward.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, I'm sorry. I just like to mention also that in case my background seems unclear when I do, when I did submit my application, I also included a cover letter and my full resume is for you to review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those are public information.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And remember and I have some comments that I want to make when I'm over it. Does anyone else have questions or should we let these good people sit down?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to share that. I actually I appreciate member Otis idea of having you come here. It reminds me as to why I nominated you. I thought I think you both clearly answered the questions and are very impressive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And I thank you for the opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, yes, yes, yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I may, can I have each of you explain what your experience has been in interacting with the City Border Commission or the city council or any other public activity where you had to participate or or otherwise contribute?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I'll answer that first of zero. I have never been part of a board here, participated in on the board or volunteered for anything. This is basically, like I mentioned, I'm I'm trying to interject something new to the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think I represent some of the families that are living here and moving here. And I do obviously, I have volunteered for my kids schools and things like that, but that has nothing to do with sort of this public forum.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have attended council meetings under the former regime or council and mayor and found it a very, very positive experience with a couple of very small exceptions that are no longer here. So it was a really it was a good experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've been to planning board meetings, also a good experience some time ago and I've worked with the planning permit department, which was also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A positive experience. So this is been a good city to work with.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess I should say that I have been to previous city council meetings and planning board meetings. I just have never been a nominee to any of these boards or commissions.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I'd like to thank you both for being such good spirits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So may I make my comments? Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody. I know we still have some items to to cover, but thanks for all the people who are in the audience. So I want to disclose that Donna Alvarez and I have known each other a long time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our sons played soccer together when they were little boys. They're not little boys anymore. Mine is 24. But that is not why I'm speaking out tonight. I had the opportunity over the city council's August break to reflect on Donna not being reappointed to the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Donna, as we have heard, is a member who has served her community and this board with distinction. She has spent hundreds of hours or more reading, probably thousands of pages of materials over the years and familiarizing herself with the matters that came before the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She would like to be reappointed, but was not. What troubles me most and again, reflection over the city over the summer, I just decided sometimes your conscious conscience dictates that you have to say what you believe and can't keep silent about it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What troubles me the most are the events that led to the mayor's decision not to reappoint Donna. It is well known that the mayor attends almost every board and commission meeting, sometimes getting up to offer public comment. But one can attribute that to a new mayor, and certainly with no previous border commission, city board or commission experience'",
        "'speaker_8': 'herself trying to familiarize herself with procedure. But I have also heard from a number of board and commission members that the mayor told them that she attends these meetings to see how they vote and wants to appoint people who share her political position.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This concerns me as a lawyer because of what I would call a chilling effect. I want to have well-qualified individuals serving on our boards and commissions, and they don't all have to agree with my political perspective. But I want independent members who will render objective decisions based on staff report, staff reports, and that would include include the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'applicable, applicable laws and regulations. Public testimony, meeting with applicants, meeting with residents. It's all the things we do in the course of preparing to make a decision rather than voting the way they think the mayor wants them to in order to be reappointed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city council and the city are better served by this course of action. And of course, the city council always has the ability to call a board or commission decision for review. That's essentially an appeal, as is being done this evening, later in this agenda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is not just my personal opinion. Since I returned in August from a vacation in August, I have heard from a number of not only members of the community, but other members of boards and commissions who shared similar sentiments about Donna not being reappointed, including this one, and I'm quoting The mayor's recent action also dismisses the investment'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of all city board volunteers and represents a dangerous path. With rare exception, past mayors have expressed their appreciation to all of the many volunteers required to run this city effectively, even those with whom they disagreed. The failure to renominate Ms..'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Alvarez is a corrosive and divisive decision that sends a warning to all board members to comply with the mayor's specific agenda or be removed. This requirement to mimic the mayor the mayor's views and echoes the mayor's voice or be dismissed is the opposite of representative representative government.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is not about mayor's prerogative. It is about a process that should not be endorsed. And that's the end of the quote. What I would say to my fellow colleagues is I think there's a couple of ways we could proceed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I would love to see the mayor reverse her decision and reappoint Donna. But failing that, I would ask that we think carefully about the votes we're about to take on the nominees that have been put before us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Iran's man. Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Manama. So I just kind of want to take what my colleague just just said and take it one step further. You know, I, too, am really distressed over the fact that Ms.. Alvarez was not reappointed in the planning board meetings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I've shown, you know, she was probably the most independent and the one that probably disagreed the most with the majority of the board. So, I mean, if we're looking for someone who has an independent voice and looks at things differently, then, you know, I think we have that person already there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, why why replace them? I do appreciate everyone who applies from board and commission. And, you know, we're very similar to, you know, we do this on a volunteer basis. We do have to run through a campaign that's not a, you know, a ten minute interview with with the five of us, but it takes a'",
        "'speaker_5': 'special breed to actually volunteer. So. And, you know, listening to the people talk, I can't recall any time since I've been here that, you know, while Jacobs, Nancy Gordon, John Knox, White, Mike Henneberry and Larry Zupan all agreed on one thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that one thing was that, you know, the best person to be on the planning board is. So I think and I kind of disagree a little bit with my colleague, Mr. De Saag, while the mayor does have the right to appoint and nobody is taking that right away from her, nobody's nominate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, nobody's taking that away. But we also have a duty and an obligation to confirm. And I take that obligation seriously. And, you know, to this day, I have not voted against any of the mayor's appointments. So I don't have any issue with, you know, this mayor and her appointees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just have an issue with this one. So we have, you know, a couple of choices here. We could rubber stamp these two appointments, which, you know, we may, in fact. Well, do we could, you know, pick one of the two and encourage, you know, a reopening of of one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I don't know if I could pick one of the two because, you know, they both had, you know, some very good answers to the questions, you know, or we could say, let's reject both of them and let the mayor go back and pick, you know, which one of the two she wants to bring back and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'hopefully reconsider reappointing Donna. But at this point, you know, I, I do not intend on on voting in favor of these, because I think Donna should be one of the people on this list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So first I'd like to share. I appreciate Ms.. Alvarez's service for the past two years. I take the nomination process very seriously. Myself along with a staff member interviewed personally. Almost every single person that applied for every commission, including those that were seeking reappointment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I attend the meetings of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ten many commission and board meetings. I listen to the public as they speak. I try to. I tried to. Here coming with these nominations. I tried to make very what I would call fair and balanced nominations that best will meet the needs of our community moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to share that. I did ask for reappointment of, in fact, all other candidates that were seeking reappointment. There was a suggestion that I was not reappointing anyone that the prior administration had appointed. That's not true. And and I appreciate that member already had of Mr. Mitchell and Ms..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sullivan speak today. First thing I had, I had never met either of them before. I was very impressed with their answers during the interview process, and I was very impressed again today with their answers. In regards to another member's comments that I only appoint people that share my political perspectives.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't believe that is true. If you look at all of the other people that have been renominated, we do not necessarily agree on on political issues. What I was looking for truly was an interview process similar to what people would be asked to go through when applying for a job, because this is very serious to our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'community. And and and I appreciate that some people may disagree with me on this. I would encourage. You know, the applications are here, they're public information. And I'd also encourage people to attend these meetings. And I'm confident I stand by my nominations and I hope that council will support my nominations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am saddened that Ms.. Alvarez was not renominated by Mayor Spencer. But my reading of the charter. The charter clearly says that it is the mayor who nominates certain positions. And whether one chooses to call that politics or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, if the mayor has a certain agenda in mind. Then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is that comes with the territory of elections. Elections have consequences. So she has nominated these two individuals who on paper and in person, in my opinion, are qualified to serve on the planning board in lieu of not nominating Ms..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Alvarez. So I'm ready and willing to support the appointments. I would have preferred that Ms.. Alvarez receive the nomination. But the charter is clear about the process that is in place.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That we've had some discussion here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About some points that go to people's qualifications. I did look at the applications of all the people who applied, and we have very qualified candidates here. I appreciate the candidates and the nominees and Mr. Rudy's initiative to have the public here and present themselves as they will be serving with the city where I diverged in opinion from'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the planning board was not on their ability to fulfill the law. It was on the application of discretionary decisions.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On our housing element.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which in my opinion, has over a zoned the entire northern waterfront of the city and of the application and compliance with our density bonus ordinance, which this Council had to add to additionally clarify. I'm confident that these two nominees can do the task.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it will be healthy at the discussion level in the planning board to have some new faces of. I am glad, Miss Sullivan. And I'll take her at a word for it that her remark about not being a realtor was not meant to disparage Ms..'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Alvarez. I will not stand for any member of a board of disrupting or acting otherwise unprofessional with their colleagues when they get there. So I hope that that case is closed. I'd like us to go forward and hit the challenges that we have in front of us, especially with planning, especially with dealing with with the over zoning'",

I'm going to just go through five slides quickly to give you an overview of the situation before you tonight and our recommendation, I'm then available to answer questions.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The applicant on this project is also here with her representatives. They don't have a presentation, but they're available to answer any questions that you might have as well. The Appellant Unite here is also available here tonight. I'm sure we'll be speaking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what we have the issue before you tonight is the planning board's approval and final decision to approve a the Marriot Fairfield in here in alameda. It's located on harbor bay parkway. And the two issues that are really being brought to you tonight are the appellant is arguing that the parking there was approved by the planning board'",
        "'speaker_11': 'is not consistent with the zoning and they are arguing that the city did not use the right a process under the California Environmental Quality Act or as we like to call it, um, Mayor Spencer and I won't speak for the mayor called it for review.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I believe based on my conversations that her concern also overlapped with, you know, I here and it was really about not the square piece but the parking. So I'm just going to focus on parking and CEQA in this presentation where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You proceed, could you just explain a little procedurally that the planning board approved the project?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and then there were two appeals filed, one by myself and one by Unite. Is that.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'You're not here. And in which case, the Planning Board's decision to approve the project the way it was at the Planning Board level would stand unless there were three votes. My understanding to support an appeal, to support one of the appeals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Men in council. That is correct. The charter requires that the Council act by three votes. So three of you will have to take an action. If you fail to take any kind of an action for whatever reason, then the planning board decisions would remain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The people that are for the project. You may want to clarify your for the way it was when it was at the planning board level. I can tell by looking at these slips that some of you may be confused on what's in favor of versus as opposed.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And let me just say just right off the bat here, so you have a planning board approval. I'm going to just quickly describe what they did. The the council has a few options. You can just a what are the staff recommendation is to just uphold the decision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We think they made the right decision. You can also amend that decision tonight right here on the floor. So if you want to change something about what they did, you can basically re approve the project with a slight change.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Your third option, if three of you agree, is to remand it back to the planning board for some specific change if you want them to consider a change. So let me just quickly make sure that everybody in the room understands what the actual project is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's, as I said, a new a brand new hotel Harbor Bay Business Park on Harbor Bay Parkway. It's a 100 rooms. The reason that the staff supported this project and recommended approval to the planning board and the reason the planning board approved it, I think there's a number of reasons.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But just very quickly, this is an important piece we believe, to support the continued evolution of the business Park Harbor Bay. Business Park. It will be one of our top five commercial tax generators once it's built and occupied.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is finishing the Shoreline Park and Bay Trail, which is between it and the water. It is designed to be basically a building in a park because it is surrounded on its waterfront side by an urban park. It is surrounded on two sides by urban park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then, of course, there's the office buildings that are across the street from it. We designed this project to really minimize parking lots because it's close to the Bay Trail and because it's close to the Shoreline Park. We wanted to reduce the amount of exposed asphalt.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there was a big emphasis on trying to minimize car large spaces paved over for cars on this particular site. So we started this conversation with the planning board and the applicant about how to really minimize the need for cars.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This project is going to be served by the Harbor Bay shuttle, which runs right past its front door, which provides access between the ferry terminal and BART. It was a business park. It also will be providing its own free customer shuttle.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That means anybody who stays at this hotel can just ask for it to be taken or picked up from the Oakland Airport. It can be be taken to anywhere in the business park. It can be the the customer can be taken to the ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this free customer shuttle will be shuttling people who would like to go to Park Street for dinner, for the movies, the hotel shuttle be providing that. So the whole idea was to minimize the need for cars for the business traveler.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They are also providing a customer bikeshare program. So if you stay at this hotel, you can use one of their bikes for recreation or if you're there. And many of our hotels here in the business park I mean, excuse me, the customers in our existing hotels are actually coming to the business park and staying in these hotels'",
        "'speaker_11': 'because they're doing business in the business park. So they really are supporting the business park. So we're hoping they'll use the bikes to move around. Of course, they've also doing valet parking and as part of their plan, they have a and a planning board approved plan, a shot, a shared parking agreement, so that in the event that'",
        "'speaker_11': 'they have a big event at the hotel or an abnormal amount of cars, they'll have overflow parking essentially across the street. And the concept of the shared parking, it works very well when you have a use like a hotel which is immediately adjacent to an office park in during the weekends and at nights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The office park parking is is generally empty. Weekends and nights is when a hotel has its largest demand for parking. So it's a very nice shared arrangement. Couple just baseline zoning issues. What governs the Planning Board's decision on this is the Harbor Bay Business, Park Zoning and a development agreement between the city and the developers of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'business park. So that provides the property owners in the business park with certain rights. Just so everybody in the room knows, hotels are permitted by that zoning and by that contract. So there was no debate about whether this should be this site should be a hotel or not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is essentially pre-approved for a hotel. The height limit, this is a tall building. It's 63 feet. But the height limit on this site is 100 feet. So it's well within the height limit. What but so what is the city's discretion?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'What was the planning board's discretion? Their discretion was over the design of the project, the site plan for the project, which includes the parking and of course, the the determination under the California Environmental Quality Act. So I said two issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Let's just I'm going to deal with one on each side parking. When we tackled this project right off the bat, we did a parking study, the parking analysis, and which was done by a third party outside of the city and analyzing the project said with the shuttles that already exist, with the shuttles that are being provided, this'",
        "'speaker_11': 'hotel needs 60 parking spaces. The zoning code requires 125. So what we did is what the planning board is. They said we will want to because of the park location, build 82 on the site, which will be more than enough to accommodate your 60 that we reject, that you will need, and then have the shared parking off'",
        "'speaker_11': 'site for another 43. So you add those two numbers together, you get the full zoning requirement of 125 between the shared and the onsite. Under our zoning code, the planning board even has the ability to reduce the total amount of parking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But in this case, what they did is they said, no, give us the full amount, but give it between the existing site and a shared facility. So the planning board action is absolutely consistent with the zoning. They used their discretion to decide what percentage should be on site and what percentage should be shared.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That discretion and that decision was based on experience in the business park. So this is not the first hotel. It's not the first hotel that has been required to have some of their parking on site and some shared.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The ratio was specifically set to match the ratio for the other hotel that has a shared parking arrangement in the Harbor Bays Business Park. So this this ratio of on site versus off site was not just a hypothetical that was sort of dreamed up by staff.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was based on experience with with the existing hotels in this business park. Your options on the parking, of course, are to uphold the planning board approval. You also have another option that's been discussed since the call for review, which is and the basic question became, well, what if she what if the property owner and operator loses'",
        "'speaker_11': 'their lease for the shared parking? The city's requirement and the planning board's resolution. It's a requirement of the project. So she might lose the lease, but she's going to have to get another lease from somebody else in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And because it's valet parking, you know, it's there's lots of parking in the business park. We were very confident that they will be able to get a lease for shared parking. But the question became, well, what maybe would be better to have the property owner purchase a piece of property?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the applicant is here tonight. She has gone out since the Planning Board's decision and acquired an option to purchase a piece of property which would allow her to build the 43 spaces on a piece of property she owns.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If this council wants her to do that, that is not part of the planning board approval.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So is your presentation show where that piece of property is?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, but I can tell you it's 1500 feet away. It's on North Loop Road. 1500 feet from this site. Once again, this is it wouldn't be a situation where the customer comes into the hotel and says, hey, don't rent a room.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they say, oh, we go park your car. 15 feet. What they would say is, okay, yes, that's great. Your room is number 302. Leave your keys with us. We are going to park your car in our parking area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So they would then valet park at that space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my understanding is that the lot she has the option on, it's next to the Gardiner preschool. Yes. At the end of the Cantu Mar Association. Exactly. Three houses or four houses?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One of them used to be mine.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But no longer. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I can vote. I'm not accused. So it's that that that small piece of property between the Gardiner and where the. That's right. Where the there's some new construction.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'V.F. South Campus is under construction right now, next to it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Close to Mr. Hager's house.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you explain the 43 that would be leased? How many feet away is that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, she doesn't have that lease yet. The way the planning board condition of approval is written is you cannot occupy this hotel till we see your executed lease. Her hope is to have it as close as possible because it will be as as convenient as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a radius within which the leased spaces need to be?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They should be within. We like to have them within a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Toby. You so the owner can't occupy if she doesn't have that leash. So, I mean, worst case scenario, the attorneys are supposed to think worst case. We have this brand new building that can't be occupied sitting on the waterfront.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The owner cannot get this lease from anywhere. And then we're stuck with an empty building. I mean, is that that theoretically possible?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Theoretically. It's a good question. And what you could I think an easy fix to that problem would it would be for the council to say, you could do this tonight, change that condition so the trigger is not occupancy, but building permit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So before we even give you approval to start construction, show us a lease. So that way at least we know we have it. We see a lease. It's for ten years. It's like, okay, go ahead, start building your building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, you're good for the first ten years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, the owner is not going to expend all that money, you know, without having a lease. But. But practically speaking. But, you know, theoretically. Okay, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I'll just let me just last word on if you decide as a council to require the offsite parking spaces, what what we would what I would advise that you do is you make it a condition of approval that she acquire it and get the design review approval for the improvements.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, it's a vacant lot so as to be paved, needs to be landscaped, trim lighting. And the reason the design review is important, not just so we make sure it looks nice, but also that's the opportunity to to notify the neighbors adjacent to it.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So if she fails to be able to get approval of design review because all of a sudden we have a huge problem with the neighbors don't want it, then it would cause the project to be reassessed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what is the zoning of that property?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's the same as this. It's a commercial zoning, it's a sqm, commercial manufacturing, zoning.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I have a question. Mr. Thomson, maybe you're getting to this. You seem to be talking a lot about the owner having an option to purchase, a lot to use solely as surface parking. But my reading of the staff report and the staff reports for the planning board that were attached as exhibits all talk about the disadvantages'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of having a dedicated asphalt lot in a in a business park that friends the water. So I hope you're going to talk about that because if you don't, I will.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, let me let me explain just a little bit. Background this, you know, the issue of parking obviously came up that the planning book or since we're talking a lot about the planning board tonight they took six months on this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So you know this plant your planning board works very, very hard and they make sure that we have the best project. So during this series, I think we had 3 to 4 public hearings on this. The issue of shared parking and permanent parking came up and the applicant early in the process said, Look, if you want me'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to go by a lot, I'll go by a lot. City staff, me and the rest of the staff. Our recommendation to the planning board and to the applicant was like, No, don't go and buy a piece of the business park to pave over for a parking lot for two reasons.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One, we think you have plenty of parking on your site, just even on your site. Forget about the shared on your site to accommodate your need if you need overflow. We think it's going to be occasionally. And we've got tons of asphalt all around your site for the for the office buildings and they're not using their asphalt'",
        "'speaker_11': '. So let's have you share their asphalt rather than paving over more. And that site that she has the option on, it's small, but it's the opposite. It has it's a lost opportunity. I mean, we want businesses and jobs in the business park, not parking lots.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's we were our reaction, our recommendation was, no, let's not require this. We are comfortable. We have experience in this city with other hotels in the business park and on Park Street with shared parking. It it works.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it was not our recommendation. But at the end of the day, you know, if it's something the council wants to do, we think this the benefits to the community of the entire project are big. For all the reasons I stated.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Was it our recommendation to do it now? It wasn't, but we only make recommendations. We need you to make the tough decisions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Brody Thank you, Madam Mayor. So just to be clear, though, the neighbors that would have a parking lot outside their master bedroom, windows with lights and nonsense that goes on at night and no security or yes, security. I mean, they don't know any this is the first time they've heard that they may have a parking lot outside'",
        "'speaker_5': 'their window.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Unless they're listening on TV right now, they don't know yet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they might have the same. And they'll come to us with light pollution concerns like like Mr. Hager has come to us with.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's why.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I mean, what if the community and the council decide they want to go, not with the shared parking, they want to go with the permanent parking. I mean, what's the path forward? I mean, what what are our options?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is what I would recommend. I would recommend that you direct staff to and basically use the way you would. What you would do is you would say, all right, we want to move forward this hotel. We want to change the planning board's parking plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So you would condition you say we would like to change this condition. We would like that permanent parking lot as a condition on this project. So the condition would read the following before getting a building permit. The current condition before occupying the building, you need a lease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we want might want to change that to we want to get you released before building permit. Take the exact same approach. Before you can get a building permit, you need to do two things. You need to get the the property purchased.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You need to design your parking lot and your lighting. You need to get design review approval from the city of Alameda. What that means is city staff, planning staff sends a notice to the neighbors and says, hey, we have a proposal to put a parking lot here and here's where the lights are going to be.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Here's where the landscaping is going to be. We would obviously design it to buffer, but there's going to be concerns, you know, all sorts of concerns about parking lots from those neighbors, as they should. They should be involved.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We should notify them and talk about that. If she gets her design review approval, everybody's like, okay, we're comfortable. She gets it. Then she can walk in the next day and we can issue her a building permit. If she cannot, now the project is stuck.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She has to then come back to this council. We have to have another hearing here and go, okay, project is stopped in its tracks. What do we want to do? That parking lot that we thought was a good idea on September 1st.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Turns out it's not such a good idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we could send it back to the planning board or I mean, is there some other in a way to keep this project moving and still have some change in the parking or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. I mean, that's that's what I just described, is you just change the parking plan to. You know, the other approach you could say is remand it back to the planning board to have them reexamine the entire parking program with a.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Looking more seriously at the permanent space we can pursue through that. Then they could approve the entire project again, and then we could wait to see if there was another appeal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's that approach.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. So, Mr. Thomas, I'm just looking now at Exhibit one to your staff report. This is the at the April 13th, 2015 Planning Board Staff Report. And specifically on page four, there is a section that says staff does not think that purchasing a development opportunity site in the business park for a satellite parking lot for this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'hotel is necessary or in the best interests of the city or the business park for the following reasons. One development of the North Loop site for business purposes instead of for a parking lot would increase job opportunities in Alameda and increase property taxes generated by the property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Number two, the business park already has large areas paved for parking which are not fully utilized, and that could be better utilized through shared parking agreements. Number three, the planning board requested a shared parking agreement. The planning board did not request development of a satellite parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then there's also the environmental consideration that paving a lot in the business park gives you yet another impervious surface, that when you know, if we get that El Nino winter that's being predicted just helps that runoff go all the more quickly into the bay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as you noted and in my years in the planning board, we did a number of shared parking arrangements because what a city really doesn't need is more asphalt parking lots. And as you also noted, the businesses for the most part tend to have their parking lots busy during the day, vacant during the evening, and yet this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'is the reverse usage of a hotel. So I just I can't tell whether there's an advocacy going on here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It flies in the face of everything I know about good planning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The staff is not changing its recommendation. We don't think building another parking lot is in the best interests from our perspective, for the reasons you said, if this board is if the city council is concerned that the shared parking will not work in this case, then I'm just here to tell you, you have this option.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You don't have to follow staff's recommendation. As I know you guys know, our recommendation tonight is to uphold the planning board's decision. That is the last sentence in the staff report. Uphold the Planning Board's decision. My board's decision has these shared parking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It does not have this. But I want you to know what your options are. And the applicant who wants to build a hotel with 100 rooms is basically through me saying to you, she will do what you on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She will do what you ask her to do. What the three of you, you know, at least three of you ask her to do. I mean, if there's consensus, I don't not I don't know if there is, but I just want you to know what your options are.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But remember, Audie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'English to bring in our colleague for that vote. Right. I guess my question is. You know, my colleague just pointed out, you know, the parking is more heavy at night in a hotel. But, you know, there's two one there's two meeting rooms.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. You know, we need more meeting rooms in Alameda. And I can imagine meeting rooms, conference facilities right there on the water can be very attractive, you know, and if we approve this project, you know, I hope they're wildly successful.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if they're wildly successful, you know, they'll be used by folks in Alameda, you know, driving there. So, I mean, I guess. I mean, that's what my kind of my concern is that, you know, even though we're going to have people come during the day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, we want people to come there during the day. And most people in Alameda, like when I go to Grandview for Rotary or whatever it is, you know, I drive out there and there's not a lot of parking there, you know, and when there's no event there, it's great, it's empty and you can carpool and do'",
        "'speaker_5': 'all that good stuff. But now I'm hoping that this is wildly successful if we approve it. And, you know, I just worry that there's not enough parking with really good meeting conference facilities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to clarify that the lease spaces are available in the evening only they're not for the day. When you're talking about shared parking for the audience and for all those that don't understand, we're talking about. Isn't that correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You have she doesn't have the lease yet. So that's another option available to you, is to amend that condition of approval so that it specifies that the shared parking lease needs to be 24 hours so that she has the ability to she has a an event.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All of a sudden we have extra 20 cars that she has the ability to spread them around.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, Mr. Thomas, going back to your April 13, 2015, planning board staff report on page five, it says the meeting rooms on the first floor are provided as an amenity for guests of the hotel. A condition of approval has been added to restrict the use of these spaces to guests to avoid the Planning Board's concerns that the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'use of rooms by non guests could create an overflow parking problem. Is that conditions still.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I the April I would have to check if that condition is still in the final approval that went to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while you're doing that, you need to have a motion. Well, it's almost 1030. Okay. Why don't you take.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That and then let me look quickly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then we're going to have member vice mayor return to the dais at 1030. We need to have a motion to consider additional items and that requires four votes on item six. We have seven speakers and then we also have items nine A through 90 the right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, we weren't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Going to we're doing we're.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Interrupting this because 1030 the motion to consider additional items and the additional items are 60 and the nine A through nine D.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Do we do we add.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. Now this is a case of 60 is the. Clement development. And then on here it says nine A through 990. Are additional items that are on the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Moves that we consider additional items. After 1030, it would be unfair to all these good people who are in the audience waiting to hear the 2100 comment. So I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. So 60 is the amount development and then nine is the council referrals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The whole rest of the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_0': '9839 Dear Counsel Referrals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have a second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any discussion? All those in favor. I oppose a motion passed as 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'See you, Frank. To answer your question. This whole during the. It's not in the planning board's resolution anymore. And it's not in the resolution upholding the Planning Board's decision. During the course of the many hearings we had. The.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The issue of the need. Your point. The need for more meeting rooms. Many of the planning board members also knew about that and people talked about that. So I think I had forgotten about that. It. Staff remove that from the final planning board thing because everybody said, yeah, we actually need these rooms or others to use.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They're not huge. So this is not a conference center. It's two meeting rooms that can probably hold maybe 50 each.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Maybe so.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Zero.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Then the five. I mean, they show 50 chairs all lined up. If you acted in auditorium style, if you were actually having more of a you know, then presumably you might be able to get that many people crammed in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, that's. Did you have any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Not at this moment, but I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Mean, why don't I just I have one more real slide so we move to secure, and then I can then then you can call speakers or ask more questions. But you covered the meat of the business here on parking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Last the second issue, California Environmental Quality Act. The staff recommended and the planning board approved the use of what's called the urban infill exemption. Remember, everybody should know state law, California Environmental Quality Act to look at the effect of projects on the environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A The state legislature passed a number of amendments and guidelines over the years to try to encourage urban infill because obviously the best thing to do for the environment is focus development in the inner urban areas and not let it sprawl out into the natural areas of the state of California.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in this case, why did we recommend the urban infill exemption? Well, first of all, we are right smack in the middle of a major metropolitan area. We are a city. This is in city boundaries. The land that we are building this project on is manmade land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, this has never been natural habitat. This was not you know, Indians did not live on this land 30 generations ago. This was made by us for a business park, and it is surrounded by a business park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is no work in the water or the bay. It is separated from the bay by an urban park. There is no we had biological we have biology experts, third party experts who deal with biological impacts out on this site twice to make sure there were no burrowing owls, no no habitat on this site.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, this site is surrounded, as you can see, by a major road and a major chunk of Bay Trail. So it's not super and it's pretty small. So it's not surprising that endangered species haven't found it to be a great home.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And this project is completely consistent of the zoning and general plan. So we absolutely believe that this is an appropriate exemption to be used as it is used throughout the city of Alameda for these kinds of projects that are consistent with the zoning on small sites in our urban area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is the definition of urban infill. The appellant is arguing, Well, you're next, you're right next to the San Francisco Bay. So it can't be surrounded. So it's not surrounded by urban uses. There is a court case, it's which deals with this very issue in San Diego where the project is surrounded by an urban park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the appellant said it's not surround, you know, that's not a urban use. And the court said, yes, it is. It's an urban park. We are surrounded by an urban park and a business park. So we are very comfortable and confident that this is the right use of Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And frankly, you know, this is the problem with Sequoia in California and why there's so many calls for reform of sequence, because it's being abused for reasons that have nothing to do with the environment. So we do not think this is an issue to do with the environment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We think this is an issue about this is a design issue, a parking issue, but this is not a sequel issue. And we fully support the Planning Board's decision on the sequel exemption.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member authority critique.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sorry. And that's a recommendation. Uphold planning board action. I'm available to answer any questions and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Brody Thank you, Madam Mayor. I just. It was in the staff report, but maybe for the benefit of those that didn't read it, if the city attorney can kind of describe that that case and. You know how she thinks it's analogous to the situation we have here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And typically I want to ask in regards to when I look at this hotel, it looks to me like it's on the water. And I appreciate it's being referred to by staff, an urban park right there. But my guess is it's I don't know how many feet away from the water and the case that you have, I'd'",
        "'speaker_0': 'like to know, is it on the water or how far is it away from the water?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, the case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That that Andrew referred to is very much applicable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because. The person, the entity challenging the decision. The second decision was saying that this is not a proper use. It's not an urban and the surrounding area is not an urban use. So the court ultimately held that even though the the park, which was about a over a thousand acres of open space and some water and also'",
        "'speaker_2': 'museums and theaters.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it's Balboa Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's Balboa Park in San Diego, if you guys are familiar with it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it's not directly on the water like this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, it's not directly on the water, although I would I would also suggest this is not directly on the water. There is a a pathway that separates it from water. Which is part of the urban park that Andrew's describing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And, you know, the distance of that park from the water to the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe it's about 20 feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the main park is more precisely. But so to me, I think that could very well be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I may. I think just from a sequel perspective, The Seagull exemption says you're surrounded by urban uses. The so the question is, is it surrounded by urban uses, not how far is it from water? The question is, is it surrounded?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Balboa case is important because the appellants said, well, it's surrounded on by a park that's not an urban use. And the court said, no, an urban park is an urban use. And in this case, we are surrounded by urban uses on one side of business offices and on the other side an urban park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Now, the fact that there is a bay on the other side of the urban park is interesting, but not relevant to the question of what the Sequoia exemption says. So we're bounded by urban uses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're being asked to make a specific finding. That secret does not apply because this advice. Correct? Right. We're being asked to make a specific finding.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exemption under Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And just for clarification, with this same CEQA exemption have applied to the other hotel in Harbor Bay, the Hampton Inn.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is what we used. Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you tell me how many floors is the Hampton Inn?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For. For. I actually don't know. So I. Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We could find out how many? Four and a half. And how many.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Floors do I hear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For? How many floors is this?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This has.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oui, oui, oui, oui.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, let me just.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is a five story. 63 feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And no one knows the height of the Hampton. One thing when I look at these illustrations, I think it's nice to end this. I'm glad you have this one here, because I think you can tell by looking at this appears to dwarf everything else in the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there anything else in the area that is of this height?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is no other building in this neighborhood that is 63 feet. The the Palladium is 60 feet. It's not anywhere near in the neighborhood. But just to give you a sense, I mean, the the top of the historic theater thingy, you know, the big sign, I mean, I don't know what that is on top of my head'",
        "'speaker_11': ', but it's it's up there in that neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can you explain why this falls under the code of our city to have a building of this height along the water?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The height limit is 100 feet on this site. That height limit is in the zoning for the Harbor Bay Business Park. It was adopted in the early eighties. The original vision for the Harbor Bay Business Park was, you know, multi-story office buildings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it has ultimately built out with more one and two story buildings that you see out there today more trucking, more warehousing and less office building. But that was the original vision upon which the zoning was created. That zoning was then consummated through what I mentioned earlier, which is called the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's where the property owners get those rights guaranteed over the long term. So for a 20 to 30 years in this case until 2019. And the reason they do that and the reason the city enters into a development agreement in this case is it was 25 years ago where the developers of Harbor Bay built us an'",
        "'speaker_11': 'entire waterfront Shoreline Park and all of the roads and all of the infrastructure for Harbor Bay, because we guarantee that we not any of us, but the council and in this eighties said, yeah, we want all of that stuff upfront.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You built all of it for us and we promise not to change the rules on you later. You will be able to build your business park even if it takes you 20 years to do it. So that's why the height limit of 100 feet and the why I keep mentioning the developer agreement at the planning board and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the council is, you know, they have certain rights and they they they paid money and invested in this property for us and all of our enjoyment 20 years ago on the assurance that we wouldn't change those rights. Their vision at that time, the council's vision at that time was this entire business park would be filled with up'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to ten storey office buildings. As it turns out, that's not what they did. But that's why 63 foot building is 40 feet less than what's actually permitted by the zoning on this site.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is there a way for council to revisit that height issue, if not on this piece of property on any other pieces of property out there in 2019?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. Not until the Belmont Agreement is expired. I believe it's 2019.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's for all.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Recollections of 2019. It's been 20 years since. Well, it's 20 years ago. We signed that agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other questions? Counsel. Any other questions? Member.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I just have one request of the speakers and I'm really interested in hearing the opinions on the shared parking versus the permanent lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't know. Could you say that a little louder so they can hear?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If the audience has the public comments, have opinions on the shared parking versus the permanent lot, I'd be really interested in hearing those thoughts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I would clarify the shared parking at night versus shared parking 24 hours. All right. And I'm going to call the names of the speakers now, Gary Thompson and then Kerry Thompson and then Robert Sanger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. My name is Gary Thompson. Thank you for hearing me tonight. I live at 88 Red Oak Road and in the Kent Moore Association. And I'm on the board of directors also, although I'm here tonight as an individual, the homeowner, the homeowners behind, behind V.F. have been in an ongoing run with them over this light cast onto'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the back of our houses by headlights from cars day and night and their development. And I'm happy to see that most of it's been mitigated. They've done various things that have helped out, but the traffic and that is a big issue, especially these parking lots you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I happen to believe that what you have here is this. This is just a poor spot for a hotel. That lot is not big enough. I think that they're kidding themselves if they think that the traffic, all these people are going to take shuttles and the shuttles are going to run people around, I don't think it's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'going to happen. They're going to have a bar and a restaurant. They're going to have weddings, they're going to have meetings. If it becomes a very popular place, people are going to drive over there. And I just think that we're not against the development of the properties over there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We just think this was a poor choice, that five storey height, there's nothing like it. From the back of our homes, we will be receiving direct broadcast light onto the back of our homes. And I don't see any way to mitigate that from the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The businesses at the park right now, they come to work in the morning about six and they go home at six. That hotel is going to be over there running 724 with a bar, a restaurant, meetings, shuttles, running back and forth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just think it is just a unless a parking situation and traffic situation is addressed. And also, I'm very concerned about the direct lighting. At at five storeys, it will direct light over the office buildings that are they are now directly broadcast right into the back of our homes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When we first moved in there, the light was so bright in my back yard I could read a newspaper at midnight. And I just think that the the light mitigation, the the cars, the parking, all of the extra activity, it just doesn't fit out there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those are beautiful places. The Stacey Whitbeck property, a beautiful place, V.F.. The work they have done there are two storeys high. They're very tastefully done. And this is just not a place for that hotel. And I just don't see how you're going to make it work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carey Thompson. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm Kerry Thompson. I am the past president of the Chamber of Commerce and the current Chairperson of the Government Relations and Economic Development Committee of the Chamber of Commerce. I am also a resident on Bay Farm Island.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I live at 3016, Linda Vista, and I urge you to reject this appeal. Number one, I just think that it's we're taking steps back. We've really made progress in showing businesses that we are ready to move forward in Alameda, that we're making progress, you know, by approving site A, by approving the Del Monte Project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've been making great strides and this is a step backwards later on in the agenda. Councilmember de Sade has a referral on the agenda to increase the transit occupancy tax, which 100% goes to the city. This hotel would generate quite a bit of tax.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So would the future hotel on site. So these are also things to consider. I think as a resident, my family sometimes comes to visit. If we don't have room. When there's a lot of us coming together, we try to find another place to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Hampton is usually full. We do need another place. And that is not an unattractive building. You know, this is planning board. The planning board has put a lot of work into making sure that designs fit well into Alameda and in actually it looks iconic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that it is unattractive. I think I can actually imagine coming on the ferry home from a long day's work or if you were visiting in the city, what a nice thing actually to look at is it's not bland, boring office buildings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is something different and it's kind of nice. I think it enhances it. Are the hotel that is being proposed there, the people that are wanting to put it there have been working. And I think you guys are wasting their time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't think that that's very fair if the planning board is doing their job, which they did. And I think to now revisit a height thing, after all, you know, that's not the reason that you put it on the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that's gone and done. So I just you know, they are providing shuttles. This is not a pie in the sky thing. They are providing them. Whether or not people utilize them, that's up to them. But they are providing them to the airport, to the various business districts, to South Shore, to wherever it is they're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'wanting to go. They're providing it. They're doing everything they can. So I don't think that it's right that you reject this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question that was raised by the last speaker. When when I file an appeal is my understanding. I do not have to specify any grounds so that I would not be precluded from can. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll address that. So in terms of best practices. What you just said is exactly right, because you don't really want to take a position on something that's going to come before you. It goes to the whole bias. You are not taking a position until you hear the evidence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's a little bit of a cleanup job that we have to do in our current municipal code. The section that deals with appeals seems to suggest that you have to say, have a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Reason.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For. That's something that staff will.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Bring back and clean up. But what we've been telling you guys is, no, you don't have to specify your reasons, because it could be construed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As you having.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Taken a position on why you're against or for the project. So we've been advising council members and the mayor, too, to keep a more general.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when I read here in this staff report for this meeting on page two that on July 23, 2015, Mayor Spencer formally called the Planning Board decision for review, citing concerns about whether the project met the city's parking requirements.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What what does that tell me?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe in private conversations with Andrew. She expressed some concerns about the parking, but when she filed her call for review, she didn't say she didn't take a position about parking or anything else about the project. She just called it for review, saying, I want it to come back or come before before the council to to revisit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the issues and say.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it was just an oral request. There was nothing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, it was an email.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, it was it went through the right channels of one to its original request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But during the appeal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I didn't see it. Was it? It wasn't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe it was an email. So it was in writing and it went to either the planning staff or the or possibly Laura as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So maybe this is a housekeeping issue, but how then would one prepare to address an appeal if one doesn't know what the grounds are for the appeal?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, in terms of an appeal, it's a little it's a little different from calling something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Out for review.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So when Unite Here filed their appeal, they had a very kind of detailed letter that laid out various grounds, three grounds for their appeal. But in terms of. Calling something for for review which council members and planning board members do from time to time its in terms of best practices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I've consulted with other cities and and in fact the city of Berkeley has something very specific in their code that says do not say why. If you're going to call something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Up for review, just.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Call it up for review. If I can jump in here as well, it is a de novo review on a call for on a call for review. So it is open at to have anything addressed. Thank you. The unfortunate part about it is if we don't if staff doesn't have an idea of what it is, then the'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Staff report, as you can see, was.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Is talking about it means that you start again. I mean, you had the whole thing in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Front of you for this this.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that was my question. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I mean, can we address other things that weren't brought up in the appeal besides sequent parking, like, for example, the light in the reflection and, you know, the issues?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would say is let's take care. There are two things that are happening here. There's an appeal by United Local, which is on specific made here. And then there is the call for review from the mayor, which is kind of.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'As you see before you, it'll be a five story iconic building, as the previous speaker mentioned. This will be a beacon on the bay coming from San Francisco on the ferry. We're very excited about this project. To address your concern regarding parking, we we feel that 82 spaces are more than sufficient to service this hotel operation of'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this size, particularly given the location being proximate to Auckland Airport. I'm a frequent business traveler. I travel on a weekly basis. I try to stay at hotels near the airport and if I don't have to rent a car, I'll take the shuttle to the hotel.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I see a lot of business travelers staying at the airport hotels, near airport hotels, so they don't have to pay the high taxes that go along with the rental. Not to mention the time they take to fill up the gas tank and check in and check out.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's it's not an efficient time use of my time when traveling for business. The other thing, too, is that at at the young age of 82, Mr. Marriott visits over 200 hotels worldwide. And I'm confident that this will be on his world tour when this hotel opens up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's a project that I think the city and the community will be very proud to have. Beyond the bricks and mortar, I think we need to look at the developer as well. I mean, a Patel is a proven developer and operator with Marriott.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She's a valued partner. She's built beautiful hotels in Texas. This is her first project in California. And we hope to build more with Mena Marriott. It's very involved in the communities that we serve, where we operate hotels, we have our spirit to serve program.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And our other mantra is take care of our employees. Our employees will take care of our guests and our guests will continue to come back. If you look at me as a hotel operator, she embraces and practices that philosophy.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At the end of the day, it's all about making money and keeping the tax dollars here in Alameda as opposed to going to Auckland airport. I think the guests will find that this is an attractive destination. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Chris Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think we all need coffee in this place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for having me. My name's Chris Clark.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm from Amarillo, Texas. Mayor Thank you for having me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Council members The reason I'm here and the reason I left my wife and kids at home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This morning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is because this family not only. Has built several.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Properties in the Texas area that were amazing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they're an amazing employer. I worked for him.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For many.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'd still be working for him if they would still have the hotel that I worked at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they ended up selling that hotel and I am doing something different. So when Mina called.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Me and gave me the opportunity to come speak on her behalf, of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Course I did in a heartbeat. Not only were. Oh four out of my five kids born when I was working for her.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But every time my wife needed me during those pregnancies, I was home. Every time I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was short of money, she took care of me. I didn't have to ask anytime I needed anything. These people were here for me. They're amazing people to work for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But not only that, they're amazing people to have in your city. Anything you ask her to do, she'll probably do for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She's an amazing person. So is her husband. So is her family. That's the most I could say now listening to the parking thing in the meeting space. I was a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sales guy at a hotel for 18 years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've seen a lot of these projects. I've never actually seen the parking lot full, even when the meeting space is mainly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because those conference rooms in these types of hotels, they're built for smaller conferences, smaller board meetings, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Lot of times you're using it for corporate entities that are probably.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Offices across the street, but they want to have a small.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Meeting in their hotel. So I don't see that being an issue, and I haven't seen that in an issue in the past. Even with the other Fairfield that she did build.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's pretty much identical to this one. That's it. Thank you so much for having me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Get coffee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Joy. Both those Daniel Brady and then Sophie Dromi.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hi. Good evening. About Amir and members of the City Council. I work at Penumbra Inc. I'm head of marketing operations there. And I'm here just to speak about my personal experience and my team's personal experience. We moved into the business park in 2007 and we've been a regular client of the Hamptons.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We love working with them. And as you some of you may know, our business has expanded. We have about 1000 employees now, but our sales force has expanded, our customer base expanded. Everything was okay till about when VF moved in, which is about three or four years ago, if I'm not mistaken.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And now repeatedly, about 10 to 15 times a year, I don't have any rooms to hold any meetings. Now, most 99% of our meetings are guests, so it's our sales reps who come for a meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At our corporate headquarters or it's.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Physicians. We're a medical device company. It's physicians who come to attend a meeting. We use busses. We right now, when they stay in San Francisco, I hire borrow a limo to shuttle a bus full of people over to Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No one wants to rent cars. We as a company actually tell our employees to use the shuttles because it's not ideal for them to go rent cars. Also, when we have the ability to hold groups staying at the business park, it adds to a community feeling because in the evening we can hold events in the in the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'city of alameda, trabuco ever since they opened and the South Shore Mall, we have had about ten events there because it's easy for us to do that when we have our people staying offsite in either Oakland or San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's hard to do that because then after dinner, you have to then. Take them back to the hotel off site in January. I have a 100 room block and I had to go to GW because there's absolutely no way I can do an event like that in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I just wanted to share my experience. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. We need a motion that requires three votes to continue the meeting past 11.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you have a second?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Frank. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now. We need a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Motion to continue past 11. And how did you move?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I moved in to Tony. I mean, Councilmember de. So did you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second? No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So, yeah. Member de SAC seconded. All those in favor, I suppose. Motion passes 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right, Frank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Lina would be proud.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Had a mayor, members of the council, Dan Reedy here for the Harbor Bay Business Park Association. I did distribute to the members of the council a a copy of a resolution and also a letter. So their part of the record, I don't think we have to restate it, but I would like to summarize a couple of points'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in the resolution and then make some other comments from from my longer letter that the business park asked me to write. We did have a meeting of the Members General membership of the Bay Business Park Association, and just ten days ago or so on the 19th of September and there was a briefing about the new hotel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A year ago it was talked about as a dream. Then everyone said, you know where it is now, and also about the appeal. And so the members who were there were the property owners and the major companies are the members of the at large.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They were very interested and showed appreciation about the hotel, similar to what you heard here about that would support some of their business activities. And also that they heard about the, you know, the income because looking they're hoping that some of that income that the city would have would come back for infrastructure improvements of the roads in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the business park, which are on hold because of lack of funding. So there was interest and this would help jumpstart the business park. But then when they heard about the appeal. Like a lightning rod. This sequel issue really came up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so let me just paraphrase part of what's in the resolution. When they hurt, they became concerned as if the planning board had not followed sequence properly and that there would have to be more sequel analysis, more environmental analysis going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And they were concerned that if the if the here if the appeal were approved, that would become like a precedent for subsequent activity, because there are still a number of larger parcels left in the business park. Many of the bigger firms bought more property than they needed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So there are other parcels around that, as well as the land going out toward the ferry terminal in the Esplanade development. And so people were concerned that they'd say, Well, do we have to have more sequel? When in 1989, when they did the business park, we did in a big addendum to the air.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the rest of the of the build out of Harbor Bay is now a cluster of little projects, each of which gets a sequel analysis. There was a sequel analysis looking at as a whole because you could look at it the traffic, the storm drainage, the infrastructure, the nature of the land.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It were all the same. So it wasn't like different parts of things so that each of them have to get a new sequel. You already had a big sequel. And so in the development agreement it says there will be no more sequel analysis required to finish the build out of Harbor Bay, which would have been the homes'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that weren't built yet, and the still at that point, empty parcels in the business park. So a number of the members became concerned. They said, let's get a resolution, get speakers here to talk to you, because some of them were concerned that that would perhaps stymie or delay or confuse their their hoped development as they would finish'",
        "'speaker_6': 'out their projects in the business park. So in our resolution at the at the end, there's a strong the association unanimously the members, you know, voted they would recommend that the city council uphold the planning board's resolution approving the final development plan and design review.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And and they deny the appeal. Also our Business Park Association has an architecture review committee. And so we worked with the planning staff and the planning board through the different iterations because they kept improving the plan and that the Architecture Review Committee of the Business Park has approved it and recommends that it go forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you have any questions, but I definitely want to give you the sense that our our membership is on board. We knew about the parking either the if at lot of 29 is in contract so it can be purchased if it's subject to whether you want it approved or that our manager was would facilitate connecting the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'ownership with the property owner. So we gave information to our manager, to the developers, how to connect with the people at the venture condos across the street or Zephyr or others nearby about their parking. So we will work with the city to try to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have a question for staff. If you've raised the issue of the secret being approved, believe was it how many years ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We used a there's been as Dan was saying, there's there was a huge cordon for the entire business park development of Harbor Bay. That was done and it was updated, as he said, in 89. What we used for this so that that's right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that document is important. I don't want to discount it. It's very important because it was the it was designed to be the final secure for everything on this site. It was also important because it helped us size it back in the eighties, the side streets, the sewer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's what we did. We did not rely on that document for this decision. We used the secure exemption that I described to you earlier. So this is a new exemption on top of that air. And we backed it up with environmental studies done this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So does this secret normally address traffic? Is that part of a secure. Yes. The impact on the community?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cars. Okay. When was the last time that there was a secret that addressed traffic?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We looked at traffic for this project this year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And staff determined that there's not traffic getting on at the Harbor Bay?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, we determined that the traffic that would be generated by this by this hotel would be much less than what was originally assumed to be on this site and in this business park. Under the original development, we also determined that we will need a stoplight at the intersection of Harbor Bay Parkway and North Loop Road.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we determined that the original development agreement that was approved by the city 20 years ago actually created a funding source, too. And they envisioned they knew this was going to happen, that we were going to need these additional lights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's money to put those lights.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate that. A concern I have is and this is this is why I want to know. Yeah. Are we making a fine do it. Does this have anything to do then with traffic? Because when you try to get on and off of Harbor Bay, there's there's traffic.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is absolutely traffic. This what we found is this project. It will not impact that already bad situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It will not. All right. So the finding is that building a hotel with 100 rooms employs two conference rooms. 50 that can accommodate 50 each will not impact the traffic on Harper Bay. So we're making that specific finding.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Were you saying over there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is over the bridge yet? Let's be clear. You have a significant impact in the mornings, during the school year, leaving from people, dropping your kids off and trying to get on and off. At that point. That's not the trips that are made for a hotel, an airport hotel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You are making a finding that there is no significant impacts being generated by this hotel that were not already identified in the original air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And when was the original air?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In 1989. And that's when you designed the entire roadway system for into all of Harbor Bay in the seventies and then the 89 addendum.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Okay, now I'm going to call the next speaker. Sofie. Jamie. Thank you, Ty Hudson. And then Robert Sanger. And then Pat Lambourne.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hi. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Ty Hudson. I'm with Unite Here Local 2850, the appellant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're going to hear from a couple of members.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of ours about why, you know, this this this hotel has very little to recommend it in terms of the sorts of jobs that it will provide. In case it's you know, in case folks are wondering why the union is against it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And you'll hear a little bit from our members about why that matters so much. But I just before I get into that, the real grounds for our appeal, I want to. I just want to say that I met with the the developer a number of weeks ago and we were talking about these sorts of issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And she told me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And when we were talking about job.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Quality that you wouldn't want to pay house employees like housekeepers too much because then they might not want to move.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Up. In the world.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You wouldn't want to pay employees like housekeepers too much. So since that issue has been brought up, the quality of the you know, that their character as an employer, I wanted to address that. Is that the kind of employer that that the that we want in Alameda?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But let me get to the grounds for our appeal, because those aren't the the the quality of the jobs and so forth are not the issues before you tonight. And I.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Have a letter from from an.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Attorney that written on our behalf that was sent just, you know, earlier today. I have copies of it for the for the council. That addresses the the seeker issues and spells out better than I can in from from the podium here what why this project does not qualify for the exemption from secure that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That it's claiming or that the staff is claiming for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'First of all.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As the as the the gentleman from from Marriott mentioned, this is a waterfront project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Whether it has a strip of dirt and rip wrap around.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The front of it that separates it from the from the bay by 15 or 20 feet. It's a waterfront project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is relevant. And one of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Reasons it's relevant is that apart from the issue of whether it's surrounded by urban uses or not, which I'll get to, there is also an exception. There are exceptions to the exemptions. One of the exceptions to the exemptions, and this is spelled out in the letter, is that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When there are unusual circumstances that create the possibility for impacts such as impacts on water quality among others. A project cannot be cannot use these exemptions. Having a waterfront project like this, that's an unusual situation for a project that would call itself a infill project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Furthermore, to talk about the strip of dirt, the undeveloped future bay trail.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In front of the hotel as an urban park is. Kind of absurd. And the court case that was cited about Balboa Park. I mean, come on. Is that Balboa Park? Balboa Park has museums in it. This is a this is a project that is directly up against the San Francisco Bay, which is not Balboa Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Furthermore, the study that was done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'About endangered about the protected species, that burrowing owl.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Notes that further observation, both studies, there were two of them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They both note that further observations should be done and that this is a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Potential site for burrowing owls.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the Sequoia exemption requires no value for habitat for burrowing owls. Does all of this mean that you can't build anything there? No, it doesn't mean you can't build anything there. What it means is you have to do an analysis under Sequoia to find out what the impacts are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hope and expect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That the council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Recognize this as this is a place where as a situation where squat should be applied and that the spirit and the letter of the law should be should be followed, and that development projects should be truly studied and analyzed and approved on their merits.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Not Lamborn and then Michael McDonough. Dana, sorry. And then Maria Aguilar.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's. Good evening, Ms.. Spencer. I was going to say good evening to Vice Mayor, who's not here and to all of the city council members. And thank you for your service. I come here when I'm passionate about something and you're here all the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know exactly how to put this. Let me see. I'm going to speak from three perspectives. One is I'm a 24 year resident of Alameda. I live right over the bridge at install and high. Secondly, I'm a business traveler.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what kind of business traveler I am? I am the training director for Unite Here International Union. Travel all over the country. And I absolutely think there is a legal basis. This is not an appropriate exemption to the urban infill exemption.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a really incomplete picture of this entire waterfront area. I went out there today and photographed it. Unfortunately, it's on my phone. But listen, this isn't. This is the San Francisco Bay. This is on a tiny, tiny piece of land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The reason it's five stories tall is because it can barely accommodate this kind of an establishment. There isn't enough parking there. I went looking for 2183 North Loop Road. It's already in use. And then I went and I found a 2.88 acre parcel of land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be a better place for this hotel. There's a huge as you know, the Esplanade project is is potentially huge. It's a vast piece of land right next to the ferry terminal. Who's buying it? What's it going to be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, this could definitely challenge whatever urban exemption they're looking for. Are they planning any parking for the ferry terminal? That place was jam packed. So is this really going. Is there going to be available parking? Potentially unlikely. So, yes, you could end up building this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll describe what this is in a minute and not really have parking available. Councilman Odie. What is this? I travel Houston. You know, San Antonio, Dallas, Florida. This is a business travelers, low and moderately priced, downscaled hotel upscaled motel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just like the Hampton Inn. Just like the extended stay. It's not. There aren't going to be weddings and events there. There aren't going to be people there on the weekends. I stay in places like this where you usually put something like this is right near the freeway, right near easy access on to the freeway, close to an'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Applebee's. And if you're in Texas, Hooters, it's not the kind of development that belongs on our waterfront. And I don't think it'll stand up to the legal appeal that we're talking about, much less the unavailability of the parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hampton Inn isn't going to help you out. They're worried about the competition. So I ask you to do anything in your power as our council, to stop this development. The fact that it's zoned for a hotel doesn't mean it has to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Doesn't the fact that it's zoned for 100 feet doesn't have to be? And you should be doing the kind of examination of development of Harbor Bay that you did for Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you would know how tall Hampton Inn is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Michael McDonough. Maria Aguilar. And then Melody Lie. Early.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Welcome back, Madam Mayor and the rest of the Council. It's been a long month without you. I'm Michael McDonough, president of the Alameda Chamber of Commerce. And I'm really glad that you're letting the speaker speak over the over their time limit, because there is not enough time for me to tell you everything I want to tell you'",
        "'speaker_9': '. So I'm going to take as much time as the union people did if if you agree. You know, the LME, the Chamber of Commerce is pro-business. That's what Chamber of Commerce is all over the world do. And this is a good project for business.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We've heard about the shuttles that'll take people to Park Street. I'm surprised the Park Street people aren't here because this is good for Park Street when we've heard about the businesses there that need places to stay. I know that's true.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a lot of businesses there that need this hotel. We've heard from a couple of people how the Hampton Inn is always crowded and full. But, you know, this square issue is a red herring. There is studies done about sexual abuse.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is a classic example. This is associations that are not. And you would expect if this was a secret issue, we'd have environmentalist here. We haven't heard from an environmentalist. We are hearing from associations that have another agenda using Sequoia as an excuse to get up here and try to hold this project up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that I think we're all smart enough not to let that be pulled over our eyes, because this is this is not a secret issue. We've got a couple of issues where the original plan says that this whole park was approved through Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There should be no question at all. We've done other sequence studies where, well, there's an exemption. I believe it's probably a fair exemption. We have attorneys I haven't heard from any attorneys from the unions. And I'm not against unions, by the way.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I used to be a member of one. This just doesn't seem like a union issue to me. This is a red herring when it comes to sequel, trying to get another agenda passed, using an environmental issue by someone who is not an environmental association.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Interesting. I would have I would expect that some environmentalists here, if it was on the parking issue, it looks like the the people are the developers are willing to work with us on the parking, whether it's the shared parking.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we have the option of saying you can't get a building permit until you have the lease. I mean, that would be an and an amendment you could make if that's a concern of yours. They're saying occupancy without.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm sure, like Mr. Odey said, they're not going to spend the money until they know they have the shared agreement. But if you wanted to, you could say you can't get a permit until you get the shared agreement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think whether it's the other parking lot that they could purchase or whether it's the shared agreement, they're willing to work with you to make sure there's plenty of parking. And I think so that doesn't really seem like an issue either.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So if sex was not an issue and parking is not an issue and we're not within the law to challenge the height until 2019. And the other thing I was thinking about the light issue. I don't think there are going to be spotlights going out from the fifth floor of that building so that it should project light'",
        "'speaker_9': 'into the neighborhood. There might be lights projected on to the building to show, you know, that there's a hotel there. But I can't imagine it going, you know, half a mile or so away to to be a really problem with the light either.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's so many business reasons for doing this. Revenues alone with the occupancy tax as it is, even if we don't raise it at 10%, which is low for the for the surrounding areas, this the performance for this hotel will show that one the first year we'll get the city will get $400,000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In the 10th year, it'll get $1,000,000. And probably upwards from that from there. And if we raise it with Tony's recommendation, it's even more so. This is a real win for the city. And if the square is not an issue, it's a red herring.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If the parking is not an issue, because they got solutions for that. And if we can't challenge, then this comes down to numbers. And it's good for business. It's good for the businesses on Harbor Bay. It's good for businesses on Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's great for the city because we want to keep the revenues here and not in Oakland or San Francisco. This is a really good project for the city. I don't think we're going to destroy the bay. This is something that I think is I would like to recommend from the chamber standpoint not to challenge this, to let'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I think you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my name is Wiley Humor and I'm the president of Unite Here Local 2850 thank you very much, Mayor Spencer and council members for allowing us to speak today. So as you've heard from some of our members, one of our concerns is the quality of jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, I believe that that's a concern for the city. We've heard that expressed by the city manager that, you know, using a space for parking when it could be a job generator would not be a good use of Blandin in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that that is a priority, but it's not something that is before you today for your consideration. Right. We are concerned because of the conversations that we regularly have with nonunion workers here in Alameda and on Helgenberger in the limited service hotel industry, where first there are very few jobs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, a hotel like this might have ten housekeepers, four front desk agents and, you know, a couple of drivers. We're not we're talking about a hotel that small enough to be exempt from many of the provisions of the ACA, exempt from the family medical leave.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Not a giant job generator and then quality of jobs we're very concerned about. We speak to Hampton Inn workers here in Alameda about the quality of their jobs. You know, as they some of them work also in union hotels or recently moved from a nonunion to a union hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So that's a concern for us. We wish it could be a concern for you, but of course, it's not before you. Today, the parking is the issue that is is before you today. And the question that I have is, given that it's not going to be a huge job generator or a quality job generator, the employer'",
        "'speaker_2': 'has made no commitments about the level of benefits or wages. Right. Why would the city then bend over backwards to go out of its way to give it exemptions to the code on the issues of parking and secure?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're talking about possibly having them purchase land, which for all the reasons that have already been said by the city staff, by the Planning Commission is not a good idea. It's furthermore pretty far from the hotel or leasing land.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now the issue and the idea of leasing shared parking from the business park across the street has been out there since April. So my question is, why has the developer not secured such a lease since April? And they came before the board again in July and said, no, we still have not secured such a lease.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then they came before you today in September, said, no, we still have not secured such a lease, but we're looking at some purchased parking instead. Now, I should point out that the code requires it's not just a suggestion, but it's a requirement that any shared parking be less than a thousand feet or less away from the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'hotel. So the only option is the Harbor Bay Park. Across the street is the office park across the street. We had one speaker come to the July planning board meeting who said, interestingly, I am a part owner in the parking lot across the street and we don't have enough parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We certainly do not have an agreement with this hotel that we're going to provide shared parking. And we are already concerned that the people who are coming to this hotel are going to UN illegally or without our permission park in our lot, which we don't have space for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've already established that every meeting space in the city is full. So this these meeting spaces are going to be full all the time during the day, not when the shared parking is available. Right. And I should note that only 50 of the spaces are actually at ground level.'",
        "'speaker_2': '32 of the spaces at this hotel are being proposed are on lifts. So you're going to need staff who are going to have to valet people, shuttle people, operate the lifts. Only 50 people are going to be able to park by just driving their cars into a space that is going to create a massive traffic problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's going to be people walking the quarter mile to get across the street by going around to the next crosswalk if they do secure that space that furthermore, the code requires that they have a seven year lease in place and and and so far they haven't been able to produce anything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next. I have a slip that doesn't have a name on it. Someone that lives on Otis. Anyone turn in a slip without a name?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh. All right. Anyway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it all right to identify you? It is 2811 notice. All right. Mike had a very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Mike had a very present planning board. I apologize for that lapse there. So my testimony in front with the planning board on this project is on the website, so you could just refer to that. But I feel obligated to give you guys a thumbnail sketch of what my reservations were on this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the project was not a unanimous vote at the planning board. I was the one dissenting vote on it. And basically my feelings on this project are I feel like I've been here before. We've done this before in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've been sold projects that look wonderful and they're going to be fantastic. And the planning board spent six months on this. So I am pretty conversant with this. And I saw the designs come. I saw them get sent back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I saw them come back again and really appreciably in the massing and design and just the overall appeal of the project didn't change much. And the drawback with the project in my mind's eye is that you've got a site that is too small to accommodate this hotel, and that point has been made by several previous speakers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I won't belabor the issue, but this reminds me of the wonderful, beautiful, unique Alameda Target store we're going to have, which is going to be unlike any other Target store you've ever seen. Well, that Target stores exactly like every other Target store that you've ever seen, you could be in Dublin or Kansas City, for that matter'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So this building, this is probably the best looking drawing I've seen of it yet, but I've also seen a lot of Fairfield Inns. I'm a business traveler also. There's a Fairfield Inn over by the Coliseum. And, you know, this is not what Alameda should be aiming for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that, you know, the Patels, it puts a lot of time and effort into this. But I don't think this is the right spot and I don't think it's the right project. On the sequel issue, Andrew Thomas has a famous quote.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, Harbor Bay was built by the hand of Man. Well, I agree with you, Andrew, but so is the Naval Air Station. And we're not exempting projects down there from secret consideration. The infill thing I am familiar with what happened in the legislature a couple of years ago on the infill development stuff as under Jerry Brown.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we're all pretty sure why that happened. All we got to do is walk out and look at this. This is not an infill project. I'm not an attorney. I'm not a secure attorney, but I tend to believe what my eyes tell me and not unfounded type of things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I said I was going to be brief, but I see the yellow lights on. I think that's at the parking was an issue, obviously, but out of those three issues, I think parking would have been the third.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thanks for your time. You have to extend the meeting past 1130 now. We do at the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'End of it now, we can just go all night. Joe Ernst.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If I if I may, Madam Mayor, just quickly, I just want to make it clear that the planning board supported this project, approved.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The sequel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Mr. Hanbury, I mean, he is not speaking for the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe the vote was 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, but the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Planning board.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With four votes made a recommendation and actually decided this this matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Joe Ernst. And he's our last speaker. If you'd like to speak on this item, please turn on your slip.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Chair. Members of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Council. My name is Joe Ernst, and I'm here tonight as president of the Harbor Bay Business Park Association. I was asked to come to this meeting on behalf of owners and also as a landowner and developer at the business park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As Dan Reedy mentioned, we did have a recent annual meeting of the owners, and there was a lot of significant concern expressed by the ownership over the appeals and the reasons for these appeals and what what impact it will have on the existing approvals and development agreements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what rights do these owners have if these approvals these rights are impacted? You know, so therefore, on behalf of the business park and the owners, you know, we do oppose this appeal based on Sequoia, which, you know, in this case is for non environmental purposes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we do oppose the appeal of a project that does comply completely with the planned development that is in place. The development agreement and plan development are very important documents. In addition, you know, bccdc, we do have bccdc documents in place for the business park and Bccdc had to render an opinion on this project and found that'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, there is adequate public access and distance from the waterfront, that there are not negative impacts on the water. So, you know, this, you know, by definition is appropriate for the waterfront and does not impact, you know, on the measures of Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we've approved you know, my firm has developed, approved, recruited companies to over 1.3 million square feet of property of buildings in the park in the last 12 to 15 years, using these same documents, these same processes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nothing's been challenged on this basis. You know, we're very familiar with the environmental issues, the wildlife issues. So and furthermore, you know, the business park, the original secret documents approved five over 5 million square feet of development. To date, there's less than three square, 3 million square feet of development in the business park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It approved building structures up to 100 feet with a conditional use to go to 156 feet. You know, so, you know, these this project does comply with the with every aspect of the planned development in the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, limits then says that, you know, if it complies, therefore, you know, that's on the basis which you have to approve. You know, there's still about 60,000 square feet or excuse me, 60 acres of land in the business park yet to be developed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's about 22%. Most of that is held by significant owners who have plans in place to develop, are very concerned. You know what? Upholding an appeal on these basis would mean and would like to know what their rights are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, the business park does need hotels. You know, Penumbra was very accurate. You know, Hampton is always full. V.F. is having to send employee visitors on a daily basis to San Francisco. That's just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Opportunity for Alameda. You know, I think it's a well-designed project. I think it brings nice variety to the business park. And, you know, we spent a lot of time over the last several months talking about what it takes to recruit businesses to Alameda, that we want jobs and we need to send the right message.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think. By upholding or by opposing the appeal here, we're sending that right message and honoring the agreements that are in place. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. He was our last speaker on the item council member. Comments, questions and Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Comments have come in. Question So Andrew is still here. Sorry. No, it's all right. So this this issue with this parking thing is still I didn't nobody said whether they liked one or the other. But Miss Huber said something about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, the different appearances before the planning board. Yes. We'll get a lease. Yes, we'll get a lease. And then the conversation with the owner of the property. I mean, where are we on that? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that accurate that there there's no parking there now and there's no there's been no approach. Many of them, you know, about a lease or we.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The discussion with the applicant has been very clear. We're not going to let you open this without at least now, of course, they also. But the planning board never said, oh, let's see the lease, let's see the lease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We want to see an executed lease. The assumption was and the way it's always handled in every project is it's going to be a condition of this project that you get a lease and that you prove you have a lease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, you think about it. She doesn't even know if she has a project yet. Why wouldn't she signed a lease for parking? She needs to know that she can build a project. Then that way we structure. It is you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we're not going to let you occupy unless you have the lease. And then based on our prior conversation, if you want to change that and move that trigger further up. So it's like, no, you show us a lease before you build a building permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess the thing I'm concerned about is it has to be within a certain number of feet. If we have the shared parking and looking at this map on exhibit three, page three, I think it is, you know, there's not a lot of spaces around there and within that that limit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if, you know, there's not availability there and there's no desire on behalf of the owners of that one property to even enter in such a lease because the parking lot is full. I mean, realistically, where is that going to go.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If she can't get a lease? I like your proposal to change the condition to a building permit. She can't get a lease and she can't do shared parking. And then obviously then the assumption behind the planning board's approval is was faulty.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We have been assured throughout this process that we can get a lease now if she can't actually come up with one, well, then you're right. We shouldn't build a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, through no fault of our own, I'm sure, you know, they're making very good efforts at it, but.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Nobody in the past has had a problem getting a lease. So if she has a problem, then she should not build this hotel. And we should I should not be standing up here telling you she's going to get a lease if she, in fact, can't.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we have never required somebody to show us and executed lease before we give them the very first land use entitlement. It's always been okay, we have agreement. Your conditions. Here's what our entitlement is and we proceed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then what about the lighting? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The lighting of the hotel. It's you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Know, if you look on I think it's page. Oh. What was it, Paige? It's still page three. So all of those homes along Lagoon on Ratto. All of their master bedrooms at night. You know, I'm going to look out onto this hotel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, they wanted, I heard iconic. And, you know, the picture this picture here that's up on the screen, you know, shows a building that's. From the waterfront looks iconic. But you know, what about from the other side?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, are there things we can do to mitigate? There's a couple of lights, the reflection, the colors, the windows. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's a couple of things we can do. We have a condition of approval that requires a lighting plan. Well, first of all, let me start. The planning board already started this conversation. They said, look, no signage up there.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the signage on this building is actually for a building of this size, very sedate. There's a there's a building on the signage on the side, not in the front or back, and then a low one on the front, which is basically a monument type sign.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so they're not going to see any lit up signs at all. They are going to see a building. There's a condition of approval about a lighting plan to be submitted with the with the building permits, which is typically reviewed at the staff level.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The types of things we look for is downward facing lights, not shedding on neighboring properties there. Certainly, there's something any particular things you want to add? You can certainly do that, like make sure that we communicate with the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other thing I will point out, though, there is prop. I mean, you're right. Maybe this gets built very quickly. Those neighbors to their living room windows will be seeing this. That is a temporary situation because what they're going to be seeing is the expansion of the V.F. campus.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is a vacant parcel between the lagoon and this property. So and everything out there is very, very flat. So they're not going to see this hotel five years from now. They're going to be looking at the back of the next expansion of the VRF campus, which is going to block their view.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You mean? I guess my concern is if you look at this picture, I mean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And sorry. Oh, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is the view from the master bedrooms of the rental road. People, you know, it's it's white. So, I mean, I'm a layperson, but white reflects light, right. So moonlight, car, cars and whatever spotlights they put on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I'm not that concerned about the view from the from the bayside.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You know, right. From the I understand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is I don't I don't want Mr. Hager to come back and say, you saw the the VFR problem, but then you built this other thing that's giving me even more light. So give me what we hope it will be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But so, I mean, that's kind of my my issue. And we do have the right under de novo review to kind of that's ask a planning board to go back and look at the light issue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well right. Or you can tell us how you want the light issue. You can either refer back for further discussion about lighting. You can also give us and we have the project architect here as well tonight. I mean, if you want specific kinds of lighting.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd like to hear from the project architect because I was ready to ask for that condition to slide steady.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Will you pull the microphone down? I'm a little.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Short. I have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One more thing left for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mayor. Nice. Mayor, Councilmember, thank you for the opportunity in addressing your question. The latest title 24 California Energy Code strictly restricts the amount of lighting you can have on the building. And also, we can definitely, as a responsible architect, we definitely will shield the lighting from what shooting projecting into the neighbors windows.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In terms of what your comments about the white reflecting light, that's a simple color palette. Color is very hard to depict in renderings and also in real life and daylighting it bounces light differently and everybody has different perception of it depends on the weather and sun angle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what we can do is actually putting in a condition to have a planner or staff going out there and do a final approval of the colored palette on site, which we have done in other jurisdictions successfully.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then I guess my other and I'm still kind of debating this in my head, you know, I wonder if my colleagues would be interested in, you know, having one vote on the secure. Because that may be a different we may have different findings on the sequel and then having a second vote on whether we're going'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to upheld based on the mayor's de novo review of the project that, you know, may include things like the parking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, can we hear from the city attorney on that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. There's no reason why you can't do that. You have two separate actions before you. One is the appeal from the from the union, which is the Sequoia appeal. And you could vote on that to to deny the appeal and uphold the Sequoia.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then you can also address then the mayor's call for review on de novo and make decisions on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that what you're making?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean. Well. Well, I think I've made a decision on the sequel, but, you know, I haven't really on the other because I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Think I hear appropriate. So it's very clear in regards to any appeal that may be brought on this we what findings we made, what our decision was. So I would recommend that we bifurcate the two points.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then I would like to move to move at least on the sequel that we we deny the appeal based on sequel grounds. And uphold the Planning Board decision on those grounds only.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we have a second. Our second. Any discussion. I believe that there were significant. Issues raised in regards to the secret issue that at least warrants more than an exemption. And I and I don't support of the city waiving something that I think is very critical of the project I believe is on the water could very well'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have impact and not only in regards to being on the water, but also in regards to its impact on our community to suggest that traffic. To me, it's not a minor issue. It is a significant issue. We are talking about two conference rooms to accommodate 50 each as well as 100 spaces of the hotel and employes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think that that could very well result in traffic that at least warrants a review of a current review as opposed to something that was done in 1989. So for. So those are issues that I have with the project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Any other comments in a second?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My comment is that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member days.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I just see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor, just a point of clarification. The traffic analysis was done in 2014.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On the matter of Sequoia as it relates to traffic and the cities that are serving users in the meeting spaces. When I look at the people who are gathered here and count the people, I mean, it's practically 50 or so people who are in the audience.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Maybe we're south of 50, but you get. So that tells me right off the bat that I'm not convinced that what we're seeing here rises to the level of not following through on planning, board and staff and city attorney's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. I'm okay with. Brexit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That you're voting for the motion, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We haven't called the question yet.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're just. Yeah, we're just trying to see. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Still have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Issues? Yeah, I have a number of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have to. Do you want to make them? I'm ready to vote. All right. All those in favor. I oppose to the motion passes 3 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I want to hear what my colleagues have to say about the others.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'll be happy to start unless.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Brash.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilmember de do you want to start? Because I think I often do. Oh, jump. Ready? Not really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll. I'll. I'll listen to what others have to say.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So I am going to move that. We uphold the planning board's action. And I spend a lot of time on this and talked to a lot of people. A number of you here in the in the room.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Anybody who contacted me about this, I talked to and this is what it comes down to for me. I appreciate hearing from the homeowners because we always need to balance adjacent uses. And you are homeowners who live next to a business park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I appreciate hearing from the project architect, because I also know from my six years on the planning board that this is the sort of thing you do all the time. And I think lighting and a ways to address these problems have become even more sophisticated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it is my desire and I think we will find a way to add a condition to make sure that the neighbors are not impacted. But we also need to think about the message we're sending to the business park.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And not only that, to businesses who might be thinking of locating here in Alameda because we still have vacancies in that business park. We'd like to fill up our Alameda point development. And we you know, we celebrate the fact that Penumbra is adding employees.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They've acquired more buildings and they're looking to acquire even more VF outdoors in North Face and we just heard earlier about our sales tax revenue reported for the last quarter. Two of the top producing sales tax generators are Penumbra and V.F. Outdoors.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is this is good for our city. We want to do more. We have heard that the hotels that we currently have are filled up. This is good. I want our hotels to be filled up and I don't want to see our business park visitors having to go to San Francisco or over to Oakland to stay because'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'd rather have them stay and spend their money and generate revenue here in Alameda. We also know that this project, the Tier, which stands for Transient Occupancy Tax, which is a significant contributor, contributor to our general fund, is going to contribute between 400 and $500,000 annually starting the first year of business and increasing after that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And the so the need is there. I think we can make it a project that serves the community well. I think it's attractive. I like the fact that the waterfront trail is being extended, a crosswalk is being put in across the street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A lot of improvements are coming along with the developer's money. I'm also concerned with fairness. We want to have applicants feel that they come before our bodies and are treated fairly. So the same requirements we required of the Hampton Inn in terms of following what the Alameda Municipal Code its the law says for parking we're doing here'",
        "'speaker_8': '. I am adamant though because I feel it's good planning principles that we do shared parking, not just paving over a waterfront space to be an asphalt parking lot when I know there's plenty of potential for shared parking out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we again, we need to be aware of. The benefits to the tourist city were always looking for ways to generate revenue. We are really fortunate that we have these great companies. I mean, they're doing Penumbra is doing a wonderful life saving kinds of work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's, you know, let's make it easier on them to have their visit business clients come to visit them and not add to the traffic with them having to have their busses and limos ferrying people to San Francisco to stay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think we can add a few conditions to make sure that the needs that were addressed are addressed as far as the union issues. Nobody from the union met with me. I did ask Mina Patel when I met.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She mentioned Alameda is rather low minimum wage. And I said, well, why don't you match what Oakland is paying? And I think hopefully people have seen the letter that was sent that they are starting to pay, starting with a wage of $12 and I think $0.32, $0.35 an hour, because that's what Oakland does.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and I want to see more employers doing that. But the issues before us right now are the appeal of the well, we've we've dealt with the Unite Here Appeal. And now I know this is a more open ended call for review, but I am prepared to follow the Planning Board's recommendation with a couple of tweaks to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'make sure that this is the most sound project we can put together. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question. Could you clarify, are the shared parking, is it within 1000 feet or less of the development? Is there a code section?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There is a perimeter. There is a distance in the muni code, I believe it's a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Microphone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they're there. My recollection of the municipal code for me, my recollection is there is a standard for the distance. It's designed for retail projects, but that is the standard and I believe it is a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this proposed lot that could be purchased as 1500 feet. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it's not a shared parking lot, right? It's so it's a different animal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there any code section that goes?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. I mean, let's be clear.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just for the record, since we've got folks here who are threatening us for not following the code, the code says the planning board. And upon appeal at this hearing, you can set the parking at exactly what you want.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You could today say no parking at all. You're fine. But so you have the ability to to structure this parking exactly the way you want it. But under your zoning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the only code section that pertains to the distance of the parking speaks to 1000 feet or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Relates.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'To 1000 feet for a shared parking arrangement. You know, it's designed for Park Street and it's designed for customers. That's why the 1000 feet, it's, you know, but if you want to hold them to that standard for this thing, then, you know, it's just just a different application.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'In this case, it's valet parking. It's not customers walking to a store, but that's what that standard is designed for. And the code is for more of a Park Street or Webster Street, where a retailer is sharing parking with another retailer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Ben Brody, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sorry to have a question. So, I mean, is it feasible that the developer could enter in a contingent lease saying, you know, you'll give me this shared parking, but I'm not going to start paying rent, you know, either, A, until the the project is open and B I cannot get out of the lease.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. If for some reason I don't get approval on the project. So, I mean, I'm wondering if that would be something that. You know, should be pursued because I'm still not feeling well. Council member doesn't talk, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member, De Saag.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, thank you very much. You know, these are the type of tough issues that we as council members get elected to make. Oftentimes when there are situations where residential land users bump up against business land uses. You know it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sometimes we shy away from making these kind of decisions. But but here we are. And it's imperative that we continue to move forward with strengthening the local economy here in Alameda. And we talk about Penumbra, for example. You know, when we went out to their annual employee celebration several weeks ago, now we got a chance to talk'",
        "'speaker_7': 'with the with the CEO of the company. And, you know, he himself a lot he's uprooting his family, moving from San Francisco to move to Alameda. So we need to continue to move that kind of progress along. You know, this this project that we have before us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, it's not the silver bullet that's going to answer everything with regard to our economic development, but it is a key part of it. You know, the businesses that we have now at Harvard Vale, to the credit of all the people who have put together that business park throughout the decades.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, you've got some great corporations there. Peet's Coffee, V.F., Outdoors, Penumbra, the Oakland Raiders. All these companies bringing in clients, people from throughout the world. And we need to keep moving that momentum. And so I hear what the residents have to say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know that they're concerned, particularly in light of the concerns about the light coming from V.F.. I hear that. But but this is one of those tough decisions, though, that I think we have to move this project along.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm supportive of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. So. I mean, if I had my druthers, I would refer this back to the planning board to resolve this parking issue, either with some contingent lease that that we can be safe and secure knowing that there's going to be one or there's some permanent solution that's been approved and gone through a design review'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that it doesn't also shine light into into neighbors windows. But. And also the lighting. But based on, you know, there's four of us up here and we need three to to pass something. And I'm not sure that I'm going to get a remand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm hopeful that those that are supportive of this project, you know, would consider, you know, some type of of, you know. Contingency on on this this parking being resolved one way or the other and and some way to mitigate the light.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well or agreeing to remand it back to the planning board until those those two issues are resolved. What if we don't get the one? Then it'd be good to get the other.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, my recommendation then, on that, what you just said right now is for us to just figure out what's the language here. Because if we can move the project along without having it remanded and, and that meets, that satisfies the project proponents and that satisfies you then.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. Yeah. Why not?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think I have the votes to remand, so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think you're right. And also I'm with Councilmember De. So he said it more than once. We need to move this project along. If we bounce it back to the planning board, we just stretch this process out and it's already been stretched out quite a bit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think we can give Andrew Thomas adequate instruction as to what we want. And I think the the architect put it very well in terms of the lighting, and I think the condition regarding shared parking is already. But, you know, I think the difference was you want the issuance of a building permit rather than an occupancy permit'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to be the triggering event.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I'd be more I think that's probably more fair to everyone now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That. But that can be done, you know, like right here. Right now. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But. You know, also that there be some concrete solution. You know, not I might get a lease or I might go off and buy because I don't think building a parking lot behind people's bedrooms is the best idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And if that's the alternative and it doesn't sound like leasing, it seems there's problems with the possible of getting a lease. So. That's why I'm leaning towards remanding. But again, without the votes, I select the solved.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm just going to jump in. Sorry, Andrew, to talk of you with your permission, Madame Mayor, that I actually had a conversation with Joe Ernst, president of the Harvard Business Association. And he indicated to me that because this is such an important project to the business park and the leasing agent is working on finding shared parking'",
        "'speaker_8': ', they're going to find a solution. I mean, it's it's a mutually beneficial situation. So I think by upholding what the planning board did, but just tweaking it to require that they won't be able to get their building permit until that lease is in hand.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We solved the problem, the parking problem.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Agree that their next step to moving forward on this is getting a building permit. And what if you amend the condition to say you don't get a building permit until this city sees the signed lease for the additional spaces, then that basically ensures that you get that lease.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I would also suggest that given the conversation, I think there's a relationship between the valet parking and the distance, the thousand foot. Is its design for Park Street, Webster Street. And it's not designed for a valet situation. So I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other thing I will put forward for you to consider in that exact same same condition is we want to see a lease for a thousand feet. This project is require to have valet service, but we're not going to limit you to the 1000 feet.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's something for you to consider.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with the lease, be just for the evening parking spaces, not during the day spaces.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, I think we have the example of the other hotel and that the parking I mean, that's what I was told that the parking lot tends to be just about empty during the day because that's when business travelers are out doing business.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The need is in the evening, the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Need is in the evening so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not a case of first impression, in other words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that takes into consideration the conference rooms.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think we have to let's not overplay. I mean, I know we want conference rooms and we've been saying it's got conference rooms. These are two, you know, reasonably small rooms. So it helps. But this is not a conference center by any means.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't plan to support it. I think it requires I think it has insufficient parking. I think when you're talking about 101 hundred rooms to conference rooms employs, I think that 82 spaces on site is insufficient. I think that the suggestion of the 1000 feet or less in regards to valet when I've done valet parking, that means'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that you have people running to get your cars. I think 1000 I don't think it should be any more than a thousand feet for valet. I actually think that's a long, you know, to suggest that it's appropriate for valet parking to be farther than a thousand feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a good runner going back and forth. And I haven't seen that in valet parking that I've used. So. And there was a comment in regards from the president kind of worried my Canterbury sites are too small to accommodate a hotel this size.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually would agree with him because I don't think the that it is sufficient in regards to parking. I do think long term we could very well have a problem with parking. I appreciate that. It may not be a problem right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think you have examples all over the city, including at the ferry on Harbor Bay, that we our projects have been approved in the past with insufficient parking. So I think that that is critical that that be addressed at the beginning of the project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also have concerns about the light and whatnot, but I don't think. I don't think it's appropriate to proceed. MEMBER Audie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you know, I agree with the mayor's points, but if we don't cast an affirmative vote to add these additional conditions, then the project gets approved. As it is. Right. So. So I'm faced with the choice if I want something reminded.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I agree with what the mayor says and all of her concerns. You know, do I vote for it so I can get something out of it that I think makes it better? Or do I not vote for it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then I don't get anything that I think makes it better and it still goes forward in a way that I don't really like it. So. I would much rather have a vote for something that at least we can get some of these conditions in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As much as I really want to remain this, since we don't have the votes, it's it's I have to be I have to be for it with these extra conditions. It's really this is not a pleasant vote to do, but I'd like to have some say in how this works rather than let the the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The decision of the planning board to go forward as it has it's written today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. Well, with that, then I will move adoption of the resolution documenting the council action on this property. Do I have an address? 2350 Harvard Bay Parkway. With the with the conditions or the additional tasks that we've given staff to address.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's some clarification. I think I want those to ask you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Just get those on the record.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think that that that the parking is resolved there either with a. The sign contingent lease or some other executable contract.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Executed lease prior to building permit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Write for 24 hour lease.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And or an approved, you know, parking lot that's gone through the design review process because if that doesn't work.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She doesn't know. If it doesn't work, there's no project. But I'm not I'm my motion does not include paving over something to just be a parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So then I think we should be clear that. We don't want any paid parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I guess that's my fear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That felt like I said it six ways to say. Okay, I'm willing to say it again. I am talking about least shared parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then if it doesn't get through, there's no project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Exactly. So. And then the ball's in the applicant's court. And I think that's fair. You know, sides have to bear a risk and. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then that the lighting issue is mitigated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, let's play that out, though. Okay. So if for some reason they can't get the shared parking. Is the project die as is, or can the applicant come back to the council planning board and say, for whatever reason we could not get the we could not get at least.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But as we had expressed from the beginning, we were always all too happy to purchase land to build. Is that a.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes? They can definitely come back at that point and say, we want you to reconsider the motion from September 1st.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But they would still need three votes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would still need two votes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So is that enough clarification, Steph?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think so, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But the lighting. The lighting. We have to review the lighting plan. I've been talking to the architect. There's no plans to light this building. You know, there's going to be laying on the ground floor. There's going to be a red light on the roof.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's the lighting plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what we want addressed is to avoid the impact on the neighbors like this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think when somebody on the fifth floor turns on the light in their room, you're going to see that the light is on in the room. But there's no this is not about there's no need to light this building.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We don't have to update it. We don't need to it doesn't need to glow at night. It's going to be a building. When the when you turn the lights in the rooms, you'll see that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because it'll also be energy efficient, I believe. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, there's ways to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. All right. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay. All right. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I oppose motion passes. 3 to.'",
        "'speaker_3': '1. It's. Fish.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we're going to take a short break before we continue the next agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My goodness.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could we take our seats? Let's proceed. If everyone could take their seats, please.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have more agenda items. All right, it's 1220 and let's go.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Public hearing to consider the Planning Board recommendation to approve a vesting, tentative map and density bonus application to permit construction of 52 units on a 2.78 acre parcel located at 2100 Clement Avenue. An adoption of related resolution.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I am going to spare you a PowerPoint. Thank you. As much as I love to giving those and tell you that this is a project that has been before the planning board also for about six months. The initial version of this project was not very good.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The neighborhood made it very clear that they didn't think it was very good. The planning board made made it very clear they didn't like the design and to the developers credit, they then went back to the drawing board and really tried to respond and completely redesign the project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The big changes that I just will highlight and the big highlights to this project. Inclusionary housing another seven or eight units. I think it's seven total. Affordable, very low, low and moderate, which are interspersed throughout the project. So not separated, interspersed the open space, a very nice open space plan that exceeds the zoning requirements and also is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'designed to not just be a public open space for the residents of the new project, but really tries to create an open space and neighborhood park for the project. And the adjacent neighborhoods, as we just think is a great way of integrating new neighbors into an existing, really wonderful neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And the total unit count also, just for your information, went from the project, qualified for a density bonus to increase the total number of units up to 58 through the the initial proposals 58 through the redesigning the unit count came down to 52 units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So the developer essentially eliminated six bonus units that they qualified for under state density law to make this a better project for the neighborhood. So final planning board hearing a couple just a month or so ago. All the speakers who came to the meeting were in favor of the project, which I can't remember a hearing that has'",
        "'speaker_11': 'happened in recent history. So that for me was a huge validation of the work that the developer and particularly the neighborhood. I cannot express how much gratitude I have for the neighborhood, you know, hosting meetings out of their homes, walking around the site, really helping us design this project so that it would really work well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I'm really pleased about that. The planning board at the last hearing, though, pulled out a condition of approval that staff had been recommending about parking. Parking, as with all our projects, as we just spent 2 hours discussing parking as an issue, parking was also an issue on this project, and we had a condition of approval recommended'",
        "'speaker_11': 'by staff about the cars and how the project should have cars. That really made it clear to the new homeowners, Look, parking is an issue. You need to park your cars in your garage, not use your garage for storing all your stuff and then putting your cars out onto the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The planning board pulled that condition out. They added some concerns about some of the wording in the condition and the fact that, you know, I've identified in the staff report some of their rationale. The neighborhood is very concerned by this last minute, not last minute, this final action by the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think what you'll hear tonight from some of the neighbors who were able to who are still here, if any, are still here. I know some of the neighbors left during last year and they said, look, I'm sorry, I'm can't stay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just can't just can't stay. But tell them I'm here to support the project, but I want that condition back in. What you'll see I handed out this morning or this afternoon in the staff report we gave you, we highlighted this issue and put in a two sentence condition in your staff report that you could consider putting'",
        "'speaker_11': 'back in or the neighborhood if you want to do that. And I think you'll hear from some neighbors tonight asking you to do that. Since the staff report was published before, you know, a while ago, the neighbors have tweaked the language a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We've reviewed this language with the developer. City staff is certainly fine with it. And the language that the neighborhood. Yes, it's that little piece of paper there that the neighborhood would like you to re-insert into the conditions of approvals before you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think you'll hear from them also. Suggesting that language. We worked it out with them ahead of time so that if you decide to put off or three. So we try to save you the effort of trying to word it yourself tonight, but you obviously can adjust the language if you see fit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Marilyn, you should see a separate piece of paper. The separate white piece of paper. I'm going to end my my comments here. I think you have a speaker slip from Andrew Warner City Ventures. That's the project applicant. He is also going to forego his 25 slide PowerPoint presentation given way I forced him.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'd like you to. No way are you getting up there and giving that. But he would like to say a few words under public comment about his project, and I think you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have a few questions for him.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are I am finished with my presentation if you have any questions. I know I haven't given this project very much attention here, but I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember our.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A question. Thank you, Mr. Thomas, for for you. So in the base case, there's 43 units. And we through email, we discussed how you arrived at the 43 units via the language of the zoning. So, so I get that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then. In order to get ultimately to the 52 cases, two events happened. One is that the applicant indicates that they're going to dedicate 5% of the units to a very low income. And when you when you pull the 5%, very low income trigger, then you're eligible for the bonus, which is 20%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that so 20% of 43 is nine. So 43 plus nine is 52. So here's the question. Because what I hear over and over again at my office hours and, you know, already all of us on council and the planning board here is just too much housing, particularly in our historic areas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why don't they pull the moderate income trigger of 10% off? If 10% of the 43 is moderate income, then that leads to instead of a bonus of 20%, it would be 5% or a total unit of from 43 to 45.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is it this? Is that the part of the applicant the say?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah, it's the way state density bonus law is structured. It's the applicant's choice to either just in arc in the city of Alameda case just give us our minimum inclusionary requirement which doesn't trigger density bonuses. And then if they want a bonus or a waiver, then they can choose to give us more affordable.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And they get to choose. In which category they want to do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So in this case, they chose to increase the very low. Which gives a 20% bonus.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you clarify for. In regards to parking, you have 52 homes. Is it based on the number of spaces that are required? Is it based on bedrooms?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's based on, you know, in Alameda, it's based on size of units. So every unit in this project has a two car garage in Alameda. If your project if your unit size is over 3000 square feet, then you need a third parking space.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But in this case, it's two per unit plus six guest parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so then we're being asked to prove these spaces based upon this formula. The garage.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Two per.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unit. So the garages are actually two parking spaces that are the formula that we require for this number of homes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the formulas say that if they don't, someone doesn't own a home. I own a car. I'm sorry that they then don't have to have a space. Or is the form because. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So whether you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which this language suggests that and I mean that's what it says residents who own vehicles park their vehicles in their garages, which I think suggests that if a resident doesn't have two cars, that they can put storage in one of the spaces.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that what that is supposed to mean?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So what this so this is a condition of approval. It says that your car shall require that if if a every unit comes with a two car garage. Right. So they're going to have a two car garage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. But if they.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you want car.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or zero cars, can they fill those two spaces with anything else? Or do they have to keep.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The way this language is written is okay, you have to park. If you have a car, you have to park it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In your right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it doesn't don't have a car. Then you can use your garage for something else, but not for business workshops or offices or living.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. But the formula truly is so if you have 52 homes, you're required. It's based upon that formula that we required to parking spaces for each of those homes, parking spaces.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We are building two parking spaces for each home. So every home will have two parking spaces. Well, what this condition is really getting at is the people who live in those homes. If they have cars, we want them parking them in the garages that were built in those units.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we don't want them doing it parking their cars in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know I'll.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Listen to the speakers, but I have a question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Regarding that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions before I call the speakers? Dorothy Freeman. Then Joe Woodard. And then Andrew Warner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good morning, Mayor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council Members Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff City Ventures and any citizens that are still with us. The development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You see before you tonight is.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Good evening. My name is Joe Woodard. I live on Eagle a block from this develop this proposed development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've spoken with all of the council members about this issue. So we're hoping that you will approve the the language that require people in this new development to use their garages to park their cars. And it's necessary because of the collision between this new kind of development, this town owned development, and the older houses on Eagle and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Willow, which were subdivided, many of them during World War two, to make room for the work force.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That built the Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Fleet. And those houses didn't make accommodations then for parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of them don't have garages, several of them don't have driveways. They got to be on the street. So any argument about creating two classes of people is moot because there are already two classes of people, those who live in the older houses, those who will live in these new townhouses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've got to make a plan for how to get these people to work along with each other and live in harmony. Now, the developers has been very good.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At working with us to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do this. We want to make sure that we include the CC in ours for the homeowners association to enforce something that's legal in in state law and a common thing done in many town developments in Alameda so that we can get along and we think it'll work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Help us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Morning Board. I am Andrew Warner with Citi Ventures. I would be remiss, first of all, if I didn't also mention that Dorothy Freeman has spent an inordinate amount of time and effort on this project. Working with me and with her neighbors and with Andrew Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And her input has been invaluable. And I agree with what the neighbors have said and what Andrew said, that the project is in a much better place right now than it was when we first brought it forward. This has been a great experience for us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think one of the things that Dorothy mentioned as well is that we've been able to find a way to integrate this new community into an established historic community. Alameda. I understand councilmember de sox concern about that specifically, but I think that the neighbors have shown we've been able to achieve some of those goals.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't want to rehash the whole project, but I will say that we as the applicant are completely fine with the condition that staff has provided you for the parking restriction requiring our homeowners to use their garages for parking and not for storage, not changing the use and happy to answer any other questions you may have about'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I do have a question. So, you know, the density bonus there is very. Different kinds of triggers for the density bonus. And the trigger that you pulled is the 5%, dedicating 5% to very low income, which then allows you to get 20%.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is there. Any reason why we're not doing the 10% trigger for moderate income?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So the main reason is when we looked at this project and we looked at this site, we did a presentation at the planning board. When we look at project like these, we like to put a half mile radius on the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We consider that a good walking distance for people to see what kind of services they can get to. And you may have seen it in the package itself, but what that shows is that this is a great place for density.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. You're less than half a mile from Park Street and all of the local stores and Park Street. And so you want to get some more houses there. We've talked to the Purchasing Business Association quite a bit, Chamber of Commerce and different business groups.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They like the idea of having more housing density around Parker Street. There's also great transportation opportunities. A lot of the great busses travel right along Park Street. The Fruitvale BART Station is only about a mile and a half away.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So these are the areas of where Alameda should be thinking about adding more density. So when we looked at the density bonus, we wanted to get the most density that we could. We will point out to for people concerned about density and traffic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, we understand that we have reduced the overall number of units from 58 to 52. And the housing element predicted, I think 53 homes for this site in particular. So there's kind of lots of reasons why we ended up with that number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have a question. When you normally do a project like this with 52 homes and how many of actually the breakdown, how many how many bedrooms total are in this project?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, it's a good question. We've got four homes that are two bedrooms each. And the rest of them are a mix of 3 to 4 bedrooms. Um, no. Call it three and a half per. Don't make me do that math.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I had during if the 160 ish bedroom's total.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So these are actually large larger homes. And then I think we normally look at the average number of bedrooms is three and a half. And so when you have three and a half bedrooms, then we're talking about we're talking two parking spaces for three and a half bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And currently, a phenomenon we having in town is homeowners renting out rooms, extra rooms that then require additional parking. And as was already shared by speakers, that there is not additional that there you have homes that don't have any parking that are completely dependent upon the street parking and hear, hear and maybe discuss the staff when you're'",
        "'speaker_0': 'looking at projects that where the average home is three and a half bedrooms and two to me only requiring two parking spaces for that and. I think that's unrealistic. And I, I mean, based upon where I live and what I see, if you have three and a half bedrooms, you could very well have more than two cars'",
        "'speaker_0': 'per unit. And the majority of these units of the 5248 are our 3 to 4 bedrooms, which is actually very large for an Alameda home. Many of our homes are two bedrooms, one bath.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So just to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Speaker eight of the 52. Have between three and four bedrooms. All the rest have three bedrooms and four of them have two bedrooms. So. The vast majority of these are three bedroom homes and. I mean. That's this has been our code for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's this is not a code we came up with for this project in particular. There was no exceptions made for this application. I mean, this is this is the same code that we require for whether it's a two or three or four bedroom home here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As I said, when we when a home gets over 3000 square feet in Alameda, then we require three. The largest size home here is 2300 square feet. So you're right, that's a big home. But so I guess I guess I'm mumbling here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, no, I'm so I appreciate that. So, again, I'm going to have a concern about the number of spaces and then the guest parking. There's six spaces total and. So is there a formula for six spaces for 52 homes?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If I if I can if I can address I think you bring up a good point, which is that the new community is going to have more parking for the homeowners than the surrounding community is in general. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's one of the things that our neighbors mentioned is that they have a lot of overflow parking to the street because a lot of their homes have been split up into multiple units and they don't have garages because they weren't they weren't designed that way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this while it is adding new housing to the neighborhood, it is certainly mitigating the parking concern because fewer of those cars are going to end up being on the street because these homes will have garages in them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, the the guest parking spaces, the city of Alameda doesn't have a specific requirement for guest parking spaces. We started this back in March with I think we had 20 parking spaces at that point. It came down, it went back up and it was all over the place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Again, working with the neighbors. We landed on a balance of the number of homes that were going to be in the community, how much guest parking we were going to be able to provide and how much open space we were going to be able to provide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think you don't want to miss the idea that there's 15,000 square feet of public park that's being created. And the final tradeoff that was made and that was decided upon with the neighbors and staff and the planning board, was this decision between how much guest parking do we want and how much do we want to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'have this nice public park where the new residents are going to be able to interact with the existing neighborhood? That's how the decision kind of was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Member Ashcraft, how.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Many square feet was the public.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Park? It's about 15,000.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then, Mr. Werner, will there also be opportunities to park on the Clement Street frontage?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, so that's a good point. The south side of Clement does currently have public parking, which is not utilized very much right now because it's a truck route and it's mostly commercial along that frontage. So we would expect that some of the overflow parking would end up on Clement Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Any other member, Odie?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to thank the neighbors for all of their hard work on that. And I did meet with with Jenny and Dorothy, and they had a couple of other things that I just wanted to make sure we covered.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think one thing they were concerned about, which I'm concerned about also, is that we keep as many trees as we can along below and eagle. I'm not sure what the plan is, but you know, that would be my preference.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And then I think they also talked about, you know, the bike path. Maybe this is more for staff, but, you know, the the mulberry thing where it goes and turns off know if we can keep that bike bike path going all the way to Clement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're not you don't own that that building that the school district does. But yeah, that'd be something we want to keep keep in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The the planning board conditions of approval. They still have to come back to the planning board on some of the architecture. You're not approving the architecture tonight and you're not approving the final Street plan tonight. The neighbors concerns about this and this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're talking about the city street plan. This is they're replanting all three sides of this block with city street trees. So the planning board is going to approve at a future meeting the final street tree plan, which, of course, will be reviewed by the public works department.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And if that includes a removal of trees that are currently on this and it's a real strange mix of trees right now. And of course, under our public notice and requirements for street tree removal. So there's a whole process which is yet to come with the neighbors and a public hearing before the planning board on the street'",
        "'speaker_11': 'trees. And then the other thing that we're going to continue, we've just begun sort of having preliminary conversations with the school district about their little piece. Okay, this project going to get that that bike path through and that public has through for about two thirds of the block.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right. We, the city of Alameda, are going to then take the lead with the school district to see if we can work something out, the school district, so we can get access all through. And then the project is offered.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If we can get access from the school district, then do some of the physical improvements, you know, to the front right away. It going to be a nice pass through.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just, you know, on the trees, the more mature trees that are there that, you know, would be okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, we so we, we love having mature trees in our community. So it looks great. It's everybody. Everybody likes them. So as many of them as we can say if we're definitely going to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think there was some issue about the, you know, the picnic area and where it's located. But yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There that's another thing that is Andrew mentioned is coming back to the planning board is the final design of that open space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So hopefully the neighbors will have a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Input and continue to be involved in this process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if they don't like it, you don't like it, let me know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other questions for the developer? Oh, before I press.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Werner, can you tell us where are those affordable units going to be located in the development?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they're interspersed throughout the community. Um, I don't have the plan in front of me, but I want to say there's 12 different buildings and so they're just kind of in the middle of a building. You may have four market rate units and one affordable unit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They're the same as the market rate homes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And as I understand it, they'll look just like the market rate homes, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, next speaker Jennie Meier, then Helen Soares and then Stephanie Butler. And then our last speaker on this item is Karen Bay. If you'd like to speak on this item, please turn on your slips.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm so tired. How can you be here so late? I'm not even going to read this and I work so hard on it. But you know what? It's okay. It's all right. No. No point. I think you got the point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You read this five page missile that you wrote about the S.S. And I think the biggest issue I think that really needs to be underscored here is that whatever wording is used, it's really important that cars fit in the garage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that a CCAR that restricts parking will be of no use unless there's some kind of enforcement policy at the front end of this thing that says you're signing this knowing that you're going to abide by these restrictions, the HRA is going to enforce it and there must be some kind of policy set in place and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'itemized all kinds of ways in which that can be done. I'm sure you can imagine what those are, but certainly it might involve fines first, fines second fine toll the car or I read places where the the the actual garages were considered as common area and they found some legal way to enforce it in this way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there are ways that it can be done. But if we don't put any teeth in this at the outset. Whatever wording you put in, the restriction is going to be somewhat useless. So I encourage you to add something to whatever you vote on that would put some teeth in it for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I respectfully kind of acknowledge your comment about the restrictions being onerous, but I sat about that for some time and said, yes, it's equally onerous for most of us living in the neighborhood that have driveways and are not allowed to put a parking garage at the end of my driveway, even if I have a pad at'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the end of it. I mean, there are all kinds of rules on our old houses that make those restrictions much worse than what they're going to endure. In point of fact, I have garage envy. I would love to have a garage at the end of my driveway so that the sun doesn't utterly destroy my car.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I can give you other restrictions that are on my house. But I won't bore you with those details. There are a lot of them. So actually, I think that the two tiered neighborhood exists by virtue of the ages of our houses and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just think that having these restrictions will somewhat equalize the situation. I even have pictures if you want to see how bad the parking is. But just envision Mulberry Eagle Willow and wrapped around Clement 7 a.m. in the morning, you might find one parking space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's about what it is. And. It's not like that all day, but it is like that. At 7 a.m. in the morning, because people come home at all different times of day and night.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker Helena Soares.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I echo the good morning. I am Helen Source. I represent the Alameda Home Team tonight, and I'm speaking in favor of this Clement development. From a broader city view. This developer, Andrew Warner, has really carried out an exceptional community outreach, not just a routine gesture, but you've seen the results of him really listening, really hearing what was'",
        "'speaker_3': 'being said and cooperated with modifying plans for these 52 precious units. That'll help serve a few people that really badly need homes in Alameda. And the added delight that he has scattered different incomes in different locations. Building the same unit for the same.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Market is a very, very great accomplishment for us. The architecture also hasn't been talked about a lot tonight other than the disparities in how you manage pre-World War Two housing and current ones. But the architecture, this infill housing has been really carefully designed to fit in with the adjacent stately homes, and it will be a credit to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city as it is developed. It's also been designed carefully to take advantage of local nearby transit opportunities and even better, this development of open space for various activities in an area that badly needs that type of relief from density.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This attractive infill development meets the ideals we advocate for in the positive additions to our community, our special community. These affordable homes are a small number. There's been a shocking week for us in the last few months. The Alameda Housing Authority recently received 336,000 36,000 applications for its housing choice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vouchers. 36,000. In just five days. If it had been open longer, there'd been more. These 52 units will help. So I hope you'll please add your seal of approval and send this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Development on its way to being a reality.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Stephanie Butler and then Karen B. Karen Baye. And she's our last speaker unless anyone else wants to slap.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor Spencer. Members of the city council. So tonight we had a room packed with people. Who need affordable housing. To me, it's very clear that we have a housing crisis in Alameda that we need to address.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The new residents that are wishing to move to Alameda are now competing with the current the residents that are currently living here. To me, that says that we need more housing, not less housing. The project at 2100 Clement Avenue at both market rate units and affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This developer has done a great job and outreach. He's given us an exciting project to add to comment. So I urge you tonight to approve this project and really give it some serious thought. Do we? Do we really?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And face of what's happened here tonight, do we really want to to slow down development and not approve housing? I mean.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We have a serious.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing crisis tonight. It blew up in my face tonight. I sat next to a woman and listened to her story and.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We really need to roll up our sleeves and work hard to solve this problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And adding more housing to Alameda, bringing more housing to Alameda is.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is a very, very.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Important part of the solution. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, council members, member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Mary Spencer Yeah, good morning, everyone. First, I do want to acknowledge both the neighbors and the developer's developer. I met with Dorothy Freeman, Joe Woodward and Ginny Dormir last week. And they well and I have worked with Dorothy and Joe for quite a few years since I was on the planning board way back when.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I know them to be conscientious. They do their homework, they study an issue, and they're persistent. And they also told me and displeased me that the developer, Andrew Warner, was wonderful to work with. And then when I talked with him, he told me that the neighbors and EU3 in particular have helped make this a better project'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And I that just pleases me to know and to hear that because it's too easy in some cases for neighbors to just, you know, resist a project and saying, not in my backyard, not in my neighborhood. Dorothy and Joe and Ginny don't do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They say, well, you know, now this isn't going to fly, but let us show you what will. And there was a lot of back and forth, give and take, and that's a great model. What I also like about this project, and it's been brought out, is that out of the 52 units, seven of them are affordable to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'very low income families. We need this kind of housing in Alameda and this is the way we provide it with developer money. This project is also going to improve the neighborhood because on on Sunday I did take a bike ride I guess stories happens that I do my site visits on bike well because you can see so'",
        "'speaker_8': 'much and so I wrote down streets I see where you live. And then the gate to the warehouse property was open because they were having that pink elephant sale. Mom and me, I don't know how they're ever going to take care of that space habitat, someone else's problem.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I was able to just ride in between and around the different warehouses. People. It's going to be good to get those out of your neighborhood and to get green space instead. And so anyway, I applaud the effort that's gone into this, the work of the planning board, because I know it went through several iterations there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I am certainly prepared to support this project tonight and I heard this morning and I hope my colleagues will as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to make sure that this language as written is included in our in the conditions of approval of this tentative map. I'm glad the newly appointed planning board member is still here, because I think what the neighborhood drove here within the constraints of what entitlements that the developer has is a model for Alameda of in working'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with again what. Entitlement. What rights the developer has. But making the open space, making the parking and making the appearance match the neighborhood. And I think that's a very good lesson. So I'd I'd like my colleagues to agree that this language is written, should be placed as part of the conditions of approval tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm ready to vote for that approval myself.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was only the hour that made me forget what happened. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll just be brief. I agree with everything the Vice Mayor just said. And also I believe we should. Put this language in there and thank you for all the hard work for the neighbors. And if there's something that doesn't work with the next process, you know, I'll do I'll pull the appeal for you'",
        "'speaker_5': ', so just let me know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You have come?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you. I'm not ready to support the project before us. I think we need to do more hard work in terms of doing what we can to limit the number of units there when that possibility is there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think I think we're missing out on a chance now, and I'm not prepared to support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have questions in regards to it's my understanding these parking the garages, there's been discussion of requiring a window so that you can monitor if the spaces are being used, the spaces are for storage. Is that being considered at this point?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Final design of the homes have not been approved yet. So that would be part of the design review on the homes. If that's something you're interested in, we can certainly integrate that into the planning process, which has to first go to the planning board and then of course, if you don't like the Planning Board's final design, you'",
        "'speaker_11': 'get all that for a review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not going to do that again. This is something personally, I think it must have windows in the garages. That makes it very easy to determine whether the spaces are being used for storage or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's totally fine to have windows in the garages and for people who may feel like this is going to be some kind of police state where the archway is like peering into windows, it's very common to have windows and garage doors, and that's essentially what we would be doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There would be windows in the garage doors. It would simply present the opportunity for people to for the HRA to check periodically that people weren't storing things in their garage and were more than happy to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Use the windows be required to not have a covering on them. So that's actually visible. So you can walk by and you can look in and you can see if this is being used for parking or available for parking versus storage, that's fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's a concern of mine. I want to make it easy to enforce this. Another concern is a question is the language here is shall include prohibitions and a monitoring process to ensure that residents who own vehicles park their vehicles in their garages.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would prefer language that is that the parking spaces are available for parking, and I'm not sure about unless the owner proves that they do not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Own a car.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because if the owner has people visiting, they're going to have cars. We have a referral coming up on this Airbnb and if they, for instance that they rent out their home, they're going to have cars. And at the end of the day, there are only six parking spaces being allocated for visitor parking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which. Which is going to be. It's going to be insufficient for 52 units. So there will be impact on the surrounding neighborhood. So in regards to so those are concerns I have. I don't know if any other council members have any of those concerns.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I don't want this project to impact the neighborhood. So this language I don't I don't think this language is specific enough.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'An American. I just think the windows and people peeking in other people's homes is a little creepy. But yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was trying to make it clear it's actually not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We'll see if we can figure out a way to enforce it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I'm just going to throw in there on the guest parking. I mean, in the neighborhood, we the neighborhoods we all live in, I mean, how many guest parking spaces are provided in our neighborhoods? They're not. It's called the public street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I think that the fact that there are six is it six plus one handicapped.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One's handicapped.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Six plus one disabled parking spot? I you know, I think that's gone a long way. Guests can also park on a mat. And I think the mayor raised a good point. I think it's what you were trying to say is that say you only own one car and you have someone visiting you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They could park in your garage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. That's so that goes to my concern, I. I would rather have the spaces allocated for parking as opposed to storage or any of these other things that are on here living quarters or whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I think the scenarios that the neighbor, the neighbors have spent a long time on this, they came up with these scenarios. They ran and passed Andrew to make sure that they were they pass muster. And so with that, I'm going to make a motion that we, the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Approve or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Approved?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's okay that the planning board approved the vesting tentative map and density bonus application to permit construction of 52 units on a 2.78 acre parcel located at 2100 Clement Avenue. And adoption of resolution approving vesting. Tentative Map ten 305 and density bonus application for the development of 52 homes and 2.7 acres of land at 2100 Clement Avenue'",
        "'speaker_8': '. The proposal is categorically exempt from review under the California Environmental Quality Act, known as Sequoia, pursuant to Secret Guidelines Section 1533 to infill development projects. With the stipulation that the CCAR is that we know well, it is that with the condition of approval for 2100 Clement also including these canards, which stands for covenants, conditions and restrictions that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'were distributed to us this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our second.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I'm hearing this correctly, by suggested changes are not being included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct? Correct. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of that, I'm going to call the question all those in favor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Suppose.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a motion passes 3 to 2. All right. Now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm just wondering, given that it's 10 minutes after one in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can I hold off on the referrals? I would appreciate that if we could hold off on the referrals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Read more. You read my mind that? Okay, they're really good, but I just feel like we won't do them justice at one in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, one's taken five years anyway. And the other one, I think, requires a charter change, so I'm fine with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City Manager Communications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Very quickly, I just wanted to let folks know that our SLA hermit tracking system, which is a perfect tracking system we have in our building department now, has what has been linked to Zillow. So if you know what Zillow.com is, so this is.'"
