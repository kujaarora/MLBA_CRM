        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor. That's me. Randy Cohen, the interim police chief.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Chief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, mayor and council. In June of this year, Council directed that no change be made to the APD policy manual without bringing the changes before Council for discussion. The Department has a longstanding contract with flexible to create, maintain, update and publish a policy manual for the department.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As part of their service. Flexible provides regular updates to policies to their over 8000 client agencies. These updates are a result of their ongoing review of changes to federal law, state law, court case decisions, and changing best practices in the field of public safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Tonight we present to you 16 policies that have been identified by like support for updating. The reasons for these particular updates vary from grammatical and formatting formatting fixes to compliance with changes in law. The proposed changes were reviewed by department staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Civil War also forwarded to the City Attorney's Office for additional review. Of note, the use of force policy is included in the 16. The proposed changes reflect the intent of the California Legislature in the passage of separate several recent bills, including Senate Bill 230.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Senate Bill 230 created a government code Section 7286. The department is required to comply excuse me to fully comply with Government Code 7286 on January 1st of 2021. These updates proposed tonight will bring us in compliance. Staff is requesting council implement the proposed changes to the 16 policies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Staff is further recommending that I be given the authority to, in consultation with the City Manager, implement further updates as necessary to ensure the Department complies with law, including case law, and follows best practices. It should be noted that staff, including myself, recognizes the council's and the community's concerns as it relates to the change and implementation of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'department policy. Further, we are committed to working with the City Manager to ensure council is informed before policies that have the potential to significantly impact the community are changed or enacted. Of course, I'm available for any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Too thin. Anyone else want to add anything either from the department or from the city attorney's office? Okay. So before we go to our public comments, are there any clarifying questions among the council? Councilmember Pelosi, your hand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Chief. Ben, thank you for your presentation. I had a couple questions. The state law says that we need to be in compliance by January 1st. Is your understanding that we need to have. It's not just the policy, correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We actually have to have it implementation ready, meaning that training needs to be updated and everything in order to be in compliance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, that is correct. Of course, we have to have the policy, but of course we need to promulgate it as well, which means we have to be able to distribute it and ensure that our staff understands it and is able to follow it by that January 1st deadline.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that there's a number of different policies, obviously, that need updating. Probably the one that's going to be, or I would assume have the most feedback would be the use of force policy. And my question relative to that is, was there I know I know and appreciate the the citations and the changes on the policy'",
        "'speaker_4': '. To your knowledge, is there any changes in terms of the training and techniques that are going to be occurring in conjunction with this policy?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can tell you that the department has been engaged in training actually this month discussing the changes to the recent changes from the California legislature, including Senate Bill 230. We've just held off on the actual particulars as they relate to the Alameda Police Department with regard to this policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're waiting, of course, for this to be enacted to to kind of finish that training. But in answer to your question that has been happening, we have been implementing these things, again, as best practices and of course, following the law as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's all my questions for now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Villa, any other clarifying questions from the council? As I said, you're not quite.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks. And I sent a couple of these ahead of time, so hopefully you're not surprised. But I'm wondering if we can get a little discussion on first. There are changes to the shooting at moving vehicles. In my understanding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My memory is that in June during the eight can't wait discussion council, not formally but fairly with with consensus said that we did not want to see a shooting at a movie vehicles policy, but the policy that it's coming forward for change actually does allow that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'm wondering if we can talk about how how that decision was made within the confines of our previous discussions. And then further, my reading of the policies related to kind of high speed pursuit seems to loosen up the ability in my reading.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I'd like to understand I'm not sure that's the intent, but I'd like to understand how we thought about that. Knowing that high speed pursuits are in urban areas and residential areas like Alameda are not generally a very good idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It struck me as odd that we are kind of making it easier for officers to make the decision to pursue through our streets at higher speeds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To answer your question is with regard to the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like I just like clarification if that was the intent or if that's something that we need to go back and look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the changes to shooting at moving vehicles policy and high speed pursuits in urban areas.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chieftain, are you going to take that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, ma'am. So starting with the shooting at moving vehicles and let me just start by saying I share your concern about shooting at moving vehicles. Rarely is it an effective police tactic in reviewing. Obviously, I was here in June, but in reviewing the council discussion on the eight can't wait.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this particular issue came up. It was also brought up that unfortunately there's been a bit of a phenomenon worldwide and in a few instances in the United States where vehicles were used as a weapon in terrorist incidents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so the discussion, as I understand it, was to allow in that rare circumstance, the ability for a police officer to attempt to stop the vehicle as the driver in the vehicle, as the weapon intent on hurting people and killing people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So our our our training, as I understand, from staff, continues to be that this is, again, not an objective tactic in general to get out of the way of moving vehicles. But again, with this narrow application, we do not want to remove the ability and again, Alameda having such as the 4th of July parade in these high'",
        "'speaker_2': 'profile events where large groups of people gather, giving officers the ability to protect them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. And then the high speed Internet areas that that's somewhat different than shooting at really vehicles, correct? Certainly accidents.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, ma'am. So that's in reference, of course, to the vehicle pursuit policy, which is also included in the 16. And there were significant language changes mostly to bring us in compliance or rather consistent with the state post peace officer standards and training or governing body for training so that our language was consistent with their language.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I talked about it with staff we don't see. I understand how that might give the appearance that somehow we loosened the rules. We don't believe that we've loosened the rules. In fact, that we believe we continue to have a very narrow policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There has to be some room for discretion, for supervisor intervention, of course. But as a general rule, we don't we don't pursue and we would prefer not to have pursuits here in Alameda. So if, again, we believe that the language is consistent and has not changed the standard that we hold our officers to, but we're willing, of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'course, to have a further discussion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alex. Thank you, Chief. And was that all for you this year?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was for now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Kelso Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I have a question regarding 468, which was the First Amendment related. What? We'll see. And then it's in for 68.7 and a page five. I noticed there was a discussion about oleo resin capsaicin, which is pepper spray.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought I recall that the council gave a direction that if we were ever called for mutual aid, that our officers would not be the people using pepper spray against residents or in demonstrations in other cities. Is that is that something we can put in here?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I personally don't like pepper spray at all, but we didn't give direction on using it in Alameda. I'm afraid on this one because I was a government official before.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And these are clarifying questions now about this, Jeff, before we will get into discussion, deliberation. But your question, Counselor Brody, is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why didn't we not or we aware that we had that discussion? In a way, is it not in there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, I recall tear gas. Did we also. I'd have to look back at meeting notes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then the second question was. The next paragraph. You know, it kind of goes into some discussion about demonstrations and some people being innocent and some people that. Becoming violent and, you know, treating people differently. Is there a reason why that was taken out?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if so, are we still going to have some type of way to make sure that, you know, protesters that are not violent are not targeted? Yes. So my understanding is that those elements are covered elsewhere. And certainly we would not use force against nonviolent protesters because they would not we would not legally be allowed to use'",
        "'speaker_2': 'force on those who are not breaking the law or otherwise. Falling under that definition. Okay. Well, thanks for those clarifications. I'm finished with my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Councilmember, decide anything from you. Okay. I think I got everybody right. Okay. So no further council clarification questions. Now, how many public speakers do we have?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I could just ask the members of the public to at least raise their hands now, because so far we only have two. And I know more people indicated that they were planning on speaking, so. Sure. Um, so looks like we're up to just four.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I guess it's just four. So they do get 3 minutes each?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, exactly. That's what I would say. As long as we have less than six speakers or six or less read, if you get 3 minutes each. So let's get started at Genesee. Evening, Denise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Yes, Janice. Thank you all for being here this evening. Haven't seen you guys in a while. It's nice to be here. After the hours of public comment regarding racism as a public health crisis, we were told that the process needed to be altered to here to wait for the findings of the recently formed committees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now we're finding the police policies are coming up. Without that committee's findings, a lot of people have an issue with the way those committees were formed. People on both sides of the policing issue. And yet here we are with another kind of secretive agenda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As far as the best practices being adopted. I feel very strongly that chokeholds should be banned without exception. Other cities have or plan to ban both chokeholds and strangle holds, and I believe Alameda should join them as currently written.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'None of these best practices come even close to the eight count items, several which several of you touted after the Watkins incident. And while I think it cannot wait, it doesn't demand enough. It is the bare minimum that our city should aim for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of this talk about training officers for better use of force. If training is so effective, then they can be trained to not use chokeholds and strangle holds and. Regarding the vehicles used as a weapon. I'm just curious.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've seen that used primarily recently in attacks from white supremacists against protesters. And I'm just I know we can't ask questions or get questions answered, but I'm really curious about the stats on how many of those incidents have been stopped by a police officer shooting out of a moving vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's all I have for this evening. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jay Garfinkle.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is regarding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, again, I wouldn't want to second what this previous speaker said about these policies going by the committee that was specifically set up for this function. If there are issues that we're required to do by law, then I would think that those could be put into effect if that's what's necessary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also want to expand, Councilman, his point about if we are participating in a shared activity with another community, how are we going to react? On any of these issues, whether we are in the other community or whether the other community is assisting us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I remember a few years ago, I think it was a deputy sheriff engaged in a high speed chase through Alameda that ended up with somebody going to the hospital. When I address it to the police chief at that time, there was really no comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The previous police chief.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was no comment. So I want to know how we. We'll be interacting with the Sheriff's Oakland Police Highway Patrol when they get to our border. Do they have to slow down and drive safely or can they continue on a high speed chase if that's what their policies allowed?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. garcia, and our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Savannah, cheer is cheer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. I. Can you hear me? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, great. Thanks for having me on tonight. Just want to make two quick points which have kind of been made by the previous two speakers. But the timing on this seems pretty bad. You created a subcommittee to review this specific issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So making changes now kind of in front of whatever recommendations they have is just a pretty bad look. Obviously, it totally negates any work that they might have done on these specific policy points. And if you have this I think I heard a January deadline or something, it doesn't seem like now would be the necessary time to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'do this, that it could certainly be taken up at a later date when you've already incorporated the recommendation and actions taken by those subcommittees. And then the second point I have is just regarding the use of force specifically.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So while I understand that you might have to come in line with state law, it seems like just doing the bare minimum to meet that law isn't really what a lot of the residents of Alameda have been asking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're looking at a more specific and a much more protective role that those particular policies might take for people. And it doesn't seem like just kind of meeting that basic law standard would do it again. What you said about chokeholds and stranglehold seems like an obvious choice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you know that not being in here is disappointing, obviously. And last just to say that. You know, none of these changes really go far enough in protecting people from police violence. And that's something that clearly the council felt was an important topic to take up by creating those subcommittees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I think it's really important that you wait on this and take the time to make sure that all those voices are being heard, that we're working so hard on it and and not just kind of push this through, it's extra troubling that it was just going to be a consent item where no one would even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get a chance to see it or say it. And certainly if some of us had not pointed that out to the community, you know, this wouldn't have come up. So that is all I have. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Chair. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alexia Arogya.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let Mr. Roger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi, everyone. Thank you all for being here. My name is Alexia Roach and I've been a resident in Alameda for years with my family. I have several concerns about this similar to the previous speakers. I feel that moving forward with anything regarding the Alameda Police Department while the subcommittees are still meeting feels a bit contradictory to that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'process. Granted, I had and still have many concerns about that process, but there's been so much emphasis on it. I feel actions should pause until recommendations come out. Aside from that and being aware of legislative changes, I still fear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I feel there is lots more that councilmembers could enable our police department to do or better yet, to not do. These policy changes enable a great amount of discretion, which I find to be problematic. Language should be clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Campaign zero has several policies that could be looked at and analyzed instead of just going with flexible. The ACLU has repeatedly actually criticized lexical and how problematic they are and how fault their faulty policies have actually exposed police departments to costly lawsuits.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To quote, Lexical is described as a private for profit company that sells boilerplate policies to public safety agencies. Personally, that's not who I want ensuring policies that affect our local community. It was just mention that these aren't acquired until January.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And though I hear it being said that people need to learn how to follow these, I don't really understand how any of these are so complicated that it would take several months to learn these changes. I also want to respond to the comment about the supposed phenomenon of vehicles being used as a weapon.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These vehicles have predominantly been used by white supremacists and sometimes even the police themselves. So I don't believe this is actually relevant to Alameda. And I think in Alameda we can actually do a lot better and more people should be heard before any sort of decision is made on this topic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Roach. Your next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was our last speaker. We have no other speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No more handset. Okay. Correct. So with that, I'm going to close have a comment on item five D and I want to start out with an explanation and an apology. When we did the agenda meeting a couple few weeks ago for tonight's meeting, I, I did ask about why this item was coming back to us and why'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it was on consent. And what was explained to me, and I think it is mostly correct, is that these were required policy changes required by law. There was an imminent deadline, and that's why we were doing this with the benefit of 2020 hindsight in reading the staff report, because when we do our agenda meetings to place things'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where they go on the agenda, we don't have finished staff reports, but with 2020 hindsight, I would have put it on the regular calendar. It is not a matter of trying to sneak something by because the public does as was demonstrated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Get the agenda. We have a 12 day lead time for agendas coming out before a meeting and they do. They immediately start communicating with us. And so this was one that was sure to be pulled, if not by members of the public, by members of the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in a perfect world, it would have just sat on the the regular item that here we are this evening. And so what I would like a couple of questions answered by whomever, maybe the city attorney's office or the city manager, because our speakers and granted, it's not Q&A, but I have the same questions many of you'",
        "'speaker_0': 'had about how should we have this process in place. We've got some very hard working community members. We've got a really impressive bunch of community members, and they're putting in a lot of time and effort on all kinds of things in addition to our boards and commissions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so this process is moving forward. We've got the five subcommittees. One of them happens to be police policies and procedures. So how does how does that mesh? How does that coexist with what we're doing tonight? So city manager or city attorney can, can you help the public and the council understand that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I can start. So there were several actions by the City Council back in June and July. One of them was as laws became implemented at the state level or other issues, they became, to our knowledge, especially legislative issues, that we could bring back these policy changes to the Council like we did tonight, to have approval through'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the city council, which is so unique because typically city councils don't approve these policies, but they would come back through the city council and which we did tonight. Most of these actually do define narrower or restrict more. Most of these policies in the direction that the city council was talking about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They may not go as far as people want them to, but they go in that direction. And then this police department is actually giving multiple presentations to those subcommittees in November, and those subcommittees will be able to go through those.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And many of these policies could actually come back through the subcommittees and actually be enhanced even further from where they are. So I saw these policies as actually moving in the same direction. They may not move as far as you want them to, but they definitely move in that way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they definitely bring us in compliance with state law because also in June and July, the state made several passed legislation on policing in a variety of ways. And these are the laws that are coming out of that that need to be implemented by January.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Levitt. Council and City Attorney's Office. Did you want to add anything, Mr. Cohen or Mr. Chairman?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, I would have to look at the managers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, it might be too strong a word, but go with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have. We have nothing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that? Is that a consensus?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought they even had something.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I did too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I said that. I have nothing to add to the city manager's presentation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, that's fine. Thank you. So council members council voted is your handicap.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, I just had a question looking at these again. And 402. Know, we took out immigration status. Has something that was inappropriate. I mean, it is. Was that fixed somewhere else or. Because we added the words actual the perceived characteristics.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But then we took out immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Councilmember Odie, are you referring to a specific app.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or to dash one of the definitions of of bias based policing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. If we're to exhibit 13, you are correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it's policy tomorrow, too. Yeah, that would be. October 13th, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And so far, 2.2 million.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11.1 year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or two. Yeah. Definitions. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Answers it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And so you're saying why did immigration status. Why is that window?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, we know why that lined out. And are we somehow accounting for that protection somewhere else?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Who would like to answer that? Hi. Did your foster. Tell me. Tell me your rank. I like to be accurate when they refer to you for my me. Your rank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm a lieutenant.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lieutenant. Lieutenant Foster, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. So that is one of the policies that was changed to bring protected.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Class language in line with the remainder of the policies. I believe immigration status isn't listed under California law as one of the protected classes, and it falls under those that might be discriminated against for immigration status fall under protection from various other methods of protected class.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And is there language in these policies that does accord protection based on immigration status?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not in immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In and of itself, no. But race or sexual orientation, etc., is all covered in there, which I believe based on the way protected class language is across. The entire policy manual was was deemed to be consistent and redundant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, are we required to to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Revise.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is to make it consistent?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that when.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So? You're asking through the curiosity, Lieutenant, what would happen? Or the lawyers maybe, or the lieutenant asking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It doesn't matter to me who answers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know what? What could could the immigration status language be left in there?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me just interject for Madame Mayor, if it's okay. I'll just I'll just have to. There are policies within the APD policy manual related to taking action, related to not taking action against someone based upon their immigration status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'None of those policies, with the exception of bias, which which we haven't yet reviewed, but none of the remainder of the policies related to immigration status are before the council tonight. But but I do know, having read most of the policy manual, that that there are several provisions related to not taking action based upon someone's immigration status'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And that I had reviewed some of those policies to make sure that they were consistent overall with the city's sanctuary resolution, which adopted several years ago, and that they are consistent with the sanctuary resolution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I question that. I would just interject for you, Mr. Cohen, and actually, Councilmember, really see what you think the the language in for 2.1.1 charts that an inappropriate reliance on actual or perceived characteristics. And I'm not sure what the actual or perceived characteristic would be that gave someone's immigration status away.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I could be really facetious and say maybe children in cages, but I probably shouldn't go there. But I mean, if someone were walking down the street, it's because when you look at the other enumerated characteristics and notwithstanding, as Lieutenant Foster told us, that these are actually part of law, they are things like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion'",
        "'speaker_0': ', sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, etc., etc.. But I think your concern is is deeper than that. Is that correct? Councilman Brody?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My concern is why this is being taken out. And if it's not required to be taken out, I'd prefer that it stay in there. I mean, we. We all know who people target when they when they go after people that they think are undocumented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, you just have to go on Twitter or listen to a Trump rally and you'll know who people are targeting. So I don't know if I would I would go so far as to say you can't have an actual perceived immigration status when a lot of the targeting is being done or they think people are coming'",
        "'speaker_2': 'from or what language they speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city manager, I think, wants to come in one day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One thing you could do on a policy like this is just defer, take this policy and defer it to later action and have it be researched and come back to the council at a later meeting in November. I mean, that would be an option if you want to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And hold that thought. Counsel And the other thing I wanted to raise with Mr. Levitt, because he is overseeing the subcommittee process, is, is there a means by which the subcommittee, specifically the Subcommittee on Police Policies and procedures, would have a chance to review and comment on at least some?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I understand the experience of provisions that are required to be in place with training and everything else by January 1st. But for those that might have a little more flexibility, is there a way to bring this to that subcommittee?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can definitely. Like I said, we are having multiple presentations to them in November and we could definitely on the policies you want, have those. Go to them and see if we can get that through their process before before the end of the year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's see what the council thinks must be voted. Another question off the floor. Yes. No, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So and then in the use of force, I think it's going to be a little more discussion on this. You know, there's a there was a comment from the audience or the public that we took it away, chokeholds from gathering evidence, but left it in there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, a can you comment on that? And then you can kind of describe more what these pain compliance techniques are because it's, you know, those are are allowed for the public's benefit in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who wants to take that? You can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. I'll start. Yes. So the governor with signing the law in September and I'm sorry the assembly bill escapes me. He banned the use of carotid restraints and neck restraints. So that's why it's been removed from policy, because it's against the law.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's why it's not even covered. And then in terms of. Living in some language that allows us to prevent someone from trying to swallow contraband. There is a notion as well as protecting people from ingesting something that may harm them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will let Lieutenant Foster speak to the techniques and all that are employed by the police department. Four Train together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Lieutenant Fortune. Then we'll go to your accounts from every other council. Somebody does still have the floor. But if you have a question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm done with questions. I'll let you have my time after this answer and then come back to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So, Lieutenant Foster, if you could in mute.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure thing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just by way of background, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In charge of our use of force defensive tactics program here at the police department. The Pink Point's techniques you're speaking of are techniques we teach our officers to cause momentary discomfort in an individual without having to resort to strikes, punches, kicks, other, you know, use of force tools.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And these pink plan techniques allow them to cause momentary discomfort to distract or to encourage compliance and getting in a police car walking direction they need to walk, etc., without substantial risk of causing injury to the subject. It's merely discomfort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's they're important techniques we can use that are a lower level of force that still accomplish our goal of gaining control and compliance in an arrest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey. Thank you. Councilmember. Glad you had your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, it's AB 392. It was a labor bill that went through this past year. And then which has to do with use of force and use of deadly force, I think is is there were two there were two bills that essentially went through.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Relative to the carotid hold. And I guess I have a couple of questions because it seems like we're we're spending there's a lot of policies here. But to the mayor's earlier question, there are a handful of policies that I think are possibly more there's going to be a more in-depth conversation that's needed and more review.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm wondering, you know, is there a way to kind of prioritize these? Some of them there's very minute minimal changes, literally references to statutory law that's changed, things like that. Those seem to be more ministerial in terms of the changes that are occurring and not substantive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I do think that there are a few policies where getting getting it prioritized. I think for the the committees are these community led groups. And I think letting them know about what the timeline is so that they can prioritize them as well would be helpful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am wary of the fact that it's not just that you have to have the written policy in place by January one, it's that you actually have to have things trained. So what does that mean? That that means not just that you're reviewing the policies, but that you're actually going for training and saying, Hey, we taught you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'all of these things before, but now you need to remove them from your repertoire and understand that this is the assessment in the continuum, and that's much more difficult to do and to get people scheduled because you can't just bring every officer in at the same time to do that training.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the tactics training needs to be reviewed up through chain of command and in compliance with everything. Plus, I believe there's going to be some Nazi updates as well. Do we are we part of that is my other question in terms of it seems like some of the posts for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The public, including the mayor and well, so the acronym stands for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to get it wrong, but it's it's essentially the standardized training and related to also onboarding. We're also going have to update our post training, correct. My understanding is there's going to be some updates to that as well in terms of like academy trainings and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we? Because we send people out to train to get trained elsewhere. Correct. For some of these things, we do the tactics training in-house, but then for for some of the other training, we we contract. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anybody wants to end this film?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So we send, of course, trainees out to go to the basic police academy and we use generally one of three. And so they all have to be in compliance. I'm not sure what their exact timelines are, but of course they are under the mandate to comply with, for instance, 10:00, 230 as well by January 1st.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. But but the other issue is that if our policy is more or beyond that, how do we address that issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When they graduate from the police academy, they come here for two weeks of in-house. Me before going out into the field to basic academy training and then get up to speed with our policies and procedures here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And so my concern is that essentially with with new trainees, we also have to factor that in relative to the training and the updates, which is going to be on a different schedule. So I'm just I'm wondering, like working with that timeline and understanding that potentially some of these policies may have to be maybe there's going'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to be some level of input now from these community committees, but that there could be more input later. Might end up being the reality because of the just because of the logistics involved with training. One comment that I had in terms of the use of force policy, some policies that I've seen have noted that the use of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'carotid holds is banned based off of state law. Whether that's a footnote or a side note or something in there that might be helpful or some definitions, because I think some of the questions that you're getting tonight are around basically explaining like what what different terms mean.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so there might be, you know, it might be helpful to have some like a definition section that outlines or references for crossover cross references, some of the training tactics. Just to give a little bit of a definition, I think Lieutenant Foster gives a good explanation to Councilmember Otis question, for instance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think also noting that the carotid holds are banned under state law and also obviously banned by the department might be helpful to alleviate any confusion with the public in terms of the policy about the the pursuit of vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I we had a long conversation about that, but that also predated our conversation and our vote on the community led subcommittees. So I, I, I feel like we gave a lot of direction, but then we also gave direction about going to these community led committees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm, I'm fine kind of flagging or having these go to the community led committees to the mayor's question earlier so that there could be some input. But I think we need to let them know what the timeline is and help them prioritize because they might not be aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of being Councilmember Bella. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'His next council. And by the way, just as a reminder, I mean, I know the council knows this, but just to make sure that the public nurses to the subcommittees have been meeting and will continue to meet, I think we're going to get an update maybe next month from the city manager about the process, how it's going'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And when they come back to us, which we anticipate being, I believe, early next year with recommendations to the Council for council is still going to make their their final decisions. But we're going to make informed decisions with all this information.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So Councilmember Desert question your next why we haven't heard from you. Councilmember Jason. You know what? I think you need to add yet another layer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. It seems as though for me, the practical consideration is to move forward with staff's recommendation with regard to incorporating the policies that the state has adopted. So our state legislators, as they always do from year to year, adopt a range of policies and procedures with regard to policing that we would presume are, you know'",
        "'speaker_6': ', best in class when it comes to policing. So it seems to me that we here in Alameda should move forward in adopting those changes. There there are already state law. So we should put them in our in our books, so to speak.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's what the whole point of the 16, 16 items that are before us tonight, if there are issues or concerns by residents with regard to improving the or any of the 16 items, including, for example, use of forests, either improving it or clarifying it, I don't see how that whole.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Should hold up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Adopting the 16 items tonight, because the 16 items are, at a minimum, their their state law. And so if we want to make them even better through the input of the residents working with the city manager, you know, we can certainly do that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But but I think it would be best to adopt the items tonight, put them in our books so that our staff, the people who train our folks and the people and if they have to interact with people from outside of the city of Alameda, they have ample time between now and, say, December 31st, 2020, because, quite frankly'",
        "'speaker_6': ', January one, 2021 is just around the corner. So from a practical consideration, it seems as though we should begin the process of adopting and implementing the 16 items that are before us tonight and on a parallel track, be open to improving some of those with the input from the residents so that everything is ready to go by'",
        "'speaker_6': 'December 31st, 2020 or January 1st, 2021. My concern, though, is that if we hold off until I don't know what date, you know, November 10th, 2020, you know, that closes that window for our men and women to be best prepared as possible come January 1st, 2021.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would I would like for the city of Alameda to move forward, recognizing that we can improve the items before us with further input. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember They said first mayor and that's politics. So you hand it back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. I what I agree with Councilmember de song in some ways, but I but I mean, I'm struggling around the policy number three because I think that there are some things the state has required us to do know that are now illegal and need to be cleaned up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do also believe that, you know, I'm not unfortunately, the way in which it is presented is very difficult to tell what has changed and what has not in some of these policies. You literally have to go and read sentence by sentence to find out what has been changed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So my druthers tonight, I think, would be that if there is an easy way to point out the things that need to that are going to change our training, and my understanding is our training already says you can't use chokeholds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe that was a talking point of our of our chief back in June and May when these conversations going. So it doesn't actually say if chokeholds are already banned, then changing the policy can happen pretty quickly because the training is already telling people that they can't do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It doesn't sound like a training change. So I'm wondering if there's a way to bring back those things that need to be made before because of state law changes at our next meeting. And it can be on consent because they are legally required changes, but that we can take that back to the mayor and others recommendations that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'we would actually engage the community policy groups and in the discussion further before making some of these changes. I want to reflect just a few things because I have a couple of specific comments as well, the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's always important for us to step back and think about kind of the system in the in the ecosystem that we are in. When I hear that a company is providing us policies that it provides for 8000 cities, what that tells me is the policies we have in our city are the same policies that all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the cities across our country are using that we are really talking about as being problematic and unclear. And so I actually I disagree with the comment. I believe it was city manager's comment that that somehow this was it's different.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I mean, it is different perhaps that we're asking to have a discussion about policy changes, but I don't think it's problematic. I think this is a healthy conversation. You know, for the most part, I'm going to support a good, meaningful policy that's going to keep our officers safe and keep our community safe as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I'm not going to support just making policy changes willy nilly. I think that, you know, small, minor tactical changes. I'm happy to move almost all of, you know, probably 14 of these. I'm happy to move forward tonight because they are really just small changes that are really not changing the policy themselves.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In fact, I wouldn't even say they are policy changes. They're changes to the text of the policy, but not meaningful actual changes in the way we institute implement the policy. So I will not be supporting a recommendation tonight to to remove our direction.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That policy change should come to the Council first. At the end of the day, it's the only way that we can ensure that our community has the opportunity to know what the policy changes are, to give input on it if they have problems, and just to make sure that there's a conversation, I don't think that's controversial in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'any way and it concerns me when I hear that somehow that's problematic. That openness and discussion about the policies in which we we do this around planning, we do this around public works. Our policies are often brought before the Council for discussion and change.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So for me, policy number three is the place I would focus. I think that there are some places that we need to change the language because of the carotid chokehold. Quite honestly, I can't tell you what that language is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That that that I would agree moving forward just because we do need to make that change. I don't like that in the vehicle pursuit policy that we're calling for. You know, we're really calling out school zones as an example of a pedestrian zone in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All our neighborhoods are pedestrian zones. We are a pedestrian city. I don't think we need to specifically say that there are special places in Alameda we're driving fast. Needs to be a concern. I would like when this comes back at some point in time to have a conversation about why we are saying that the speed limit in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the speeds of the vehicles are no longer shall be considered but should be considered. Again, I think, you know, one of the things that we have as we talk about accountability is that every time we loosen up and give more and more discretion, courts make it more and more difficult for us to to hold a behavior that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is unacceptable accountable. And so I think that there are some places where in a community like Alameda, we don't want people driving really, really fast. And, you know, I do think that there is some flexibility that should be given, but I think that it should be very tight.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think that there should be a real concerted decision that's made. When that conversation is going. You know, additionally, we heard multiple people or or community who came in and talked about this. Our city has communications channels and I'm really unclear why it's not being used to broadcast and discuss the fact that these policy changes are'",
        "'speaker_5': 'coming forward. There was a blog post today that identified that for the first time our our city communications channel seemed to be spending more time talking about the fact that crimes are happening with no information that the community can act on in less time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Actually giving them information on what the city is doing about crime and less time on what the city is doing on steps they can take to help us address crime after the fact. If a crime it's happened is not a very useful thing to do, and it is very telling to me that that started in June.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The same period last year, 11% of our social media posts were about crimes that had happened since June this year. 60% have been about that. It's no wonder people think that crime is rampant. So let's get back to being reasonable and talking to our community and having conversations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think one place that we can start is making sure that when we are making policy changes around vehicles, around shooting of vehicles, around removing chokeholds and whatnot, that we're engaging people in that conversation and bringing them into the conversation so that they can participate into a little bit further.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I will support what it sounds like, at least from the mayor and from us as he, Ashcraft and Councilmember Vela were suggesting, is sending much or most of us to the to the committees for further refinement. I'll be looking for that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And like I said, I personally would appreciate it if if there is a motion to remove council for review and approval. I would appreciate if we could by four get those two votes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for clarification, since I was referenced in your remarks, Vice Mayor, I, I will want to have probably the city attorney's office in whichever member or members of the police department just help us go through item by item, because there are certain ones that really are time critical and have a date and we need to be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'compliant with state law. I think you agree with that. I know I could see our city manager. Mr. Levitt, you wanted to speak to did you run it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Was just going to clarify two things. One is the main thing I was going to clarify at this point, I guess, is that we brought all of the changes that we were doing to the policies. So I would agree with the vice mayor that some of them probably would not be defined as policy changes, but they are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'changes in the policy manual. And so to be transparent, we brought them all forward to the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember o.T.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. One quick clarification. I think the state reports that there were 16, but I kind of 15. There's fiscal 15. 15. Okay, good. So when I looked at these, there were four, eight, nine, ten. I mean, ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we're ministerial. I would probably put jewelry also as ministerial. And then there were four others that were, you know what I would say, non-ministerial. Like 300 about use of force, in my opinion, for oh two taking out immigration, because all of the other policies that quote unquote conformed with the state definition of protected class didn't'",
        "'speaker_2': 'have immigration status taken out. You know, it just rearranged some words. You know, the First Amendment one I think means a little more community discussion and then, of course, to be able to pursue it. So, I mean, I'm fine with, you know, moving forward, these ministerial ones, which you can correct me if I'm misinterpreting, but that's 102'",
        "'speaker_2': '2338. 1059 804 343 2328 1000 1002 And you know, 1044 you know, there's a lot of a lot of, you know, changes that still looks ministerial to me. And I don't know if that really impacts people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry to interrupt you, Councilor, over that was just a little bit slower.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Again, these are my interpretations of ministerial. Others may have different opinion. 100 220. 338. 1059 Sorry to jump.'",
        "'speaker_0': '804 That's when you get more accurate.'",
        "'speaker_2': '338 1059 804 1803 40.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three 2340. I really do go back and forth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. 328. 1000. 1000 to and 1044. I mean, arguably four to his ministerial if you didn't take immigration status out. But I have a problem taking immigration status now. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what? That leaves. Am I, if I'm reading this correctly, is policies number 303.'",
        "'speaker_4': '4404.'",
        "'speaker_0': '68 and 042 because of the immigration base.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's my personal issue. And as far as going forward. I think we did decide that we wanted to have these come to the council to review. I mean, the ministerial ones are really not interested in having a full blown regular agenda item on they could either be put on consent or, you know, delivered in some other'",
        "'speaker_2': 'form of communication. But, you know, these are at least three of these four, you know, deal with the issues that we've been wrestling with for, you know, four or five months now, the use of force and protesting against First Amendment and, you know, vehicle pursuits.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'd like to see and I think the mayor talked about it and others of my colleagues, if we have to pass something to comply with state law, let's pass it. But for the most part on these, I think they need to go to these committees that we set up and that we delegated this responsibility and we're'",
        "'speaker_2': 'trusting to evaluate them. So I'm not really interested in short circuiting in that process, but if we have to do something now to comply, let's do it. But with the knowledge that these committees are going to look at these these these policies in particular and make them better.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's kind of where I stand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In council, really. I agree with you on both points that you raised. I do think we need to move forward to comply with law. And I also think that we need to bring some of these more controversial ones, if you will, to the subcommittees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think they're mutually exclusive propositions. We I think we need to keep some things moving forward to be compliant with state law. And then, I mean, we will always need to be compliant with state law, but I think we can get a little more individualized tailoring perhaps for this community within our ability to do so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Dela.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. And notwithstanding the changes required by state law, the committees have asked for significant amount of data and are reviewing the policies, is my understanding. So even if we did approve something, they're subject to the review or an input by the committees.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is what I've been led to believe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's why energy. Is that correct, Mr. Levitt?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, no. I would agree that they are reviewing different things and they could definitely review any of these that you would approve. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my other question is, have they been made aware about the the timeline for changes when they had their first meetings? And were they do they know that these proposals or were they alerted that these proposals were put on our agenda?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I did tell the steering committee that we were coming forward with some of these basic changes based on the state law. I was not at the last step, at the last meetings where they had with the various committees, because it was scheduled during a city council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I couldn't be there. So I couldn't say whether that was communicated. Again, any of these changes could be go back to them. Our policy manuals, approximately between 708 hundred pages. I think, you know, in other organizations I've been in just in a thorough review of policies with a team of attorneys and people out of the police'",
        "'speaker_3': 'department. I've seen those reviews go somewhere in the neighborhood of a year and a half to two years before you get to a conclusion, and that's with experts in the field. So so I think they need to follow course on different policies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think what you're doing here is the same type of focus they should be doing to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And can somebody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I was going to make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Could I just make a comment really quickly?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of course.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I was going to say is, I think I heard the vice mayor suggest that we get some of these quickly to the policy committees and come back on November 7th, the next meeting. I don't think that's really practical for this reason that the short turnaround time for this staff report to go out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you stop and think of getting some substantive material to subcommittees. They need to convene me, review it, get it back to staff. And I don't think that it works to come back to us on the seventh, but I, I think there may be a solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want to speak for other people, but that may satisfy all of our our concerns. Back to you, Councilmember. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, let's try this. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. So I'd like to move, first of all, approval of the one, two, three, four, three, the 11 ones that I thought were ministerial. If someone else has a disagreement, they could they could adjust that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd like to move approval of 402 without striking immigration status from the policy and then with approval of 300 468 and 314, but also refer those as high priority items for the Task Force Less Community Committee with a note that we want to see an amendment to 300, whether it's a footnote or some other item, noting that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the state ban the chokeholds and then. Yeah, but the. I'm open to any other suggestions specifically, but I really don't want to get too much into the weeds on telling the committee committee what to do and those other three.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But essentially you were moving them all forward, some with caveats.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, moving forward for 40402 striking immigration status and the other three, you know, moving forward also, but doing it in a way that we give them to the committee right away and say these are three that were approved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We want you to weigh in on these in a kind of urgent basis, but also with some direction that on 300, which is the use of force we do when it comes from the rebels suggested and note that even though these things are not listed in there, they were banned.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just so the public understands that they're banned, whether it's a footnote or whether it's not in the policy or whatever, it doesn't matter to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I have a question for stab it for the city attorney's office. So are you all working or at least consulting with the subcommittees so that if they come up with suggestions for modifications or additions, modifications to policies that they would pass legal muster.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We we'd be happy to work with the subcommittee and our colleagues to provide our legal advice at all levels, whether it's with our colleagues on the staff level, with the committees and with the council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. City attorney Shane Katz everyday. Thank. And at that other microphone Tony.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a question to clarify the motion on the floor. And the question is, are would we, in effect, move all 15? Although in the text it says 16. But would we, in effect, move all of the policy changes, both ministerial and the more substantive ones?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that is that at a minimum, what's on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maker of the motion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everything would be as is with the exception of not striking immigration status from 402 and putting some some note in 300 about what the state banned. Oh, okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Did you want a second? Okay, I don't want a second. And then count my marriage next. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I will second the motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any further discussion?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I can I ask that? I just I would like to cancel my permit. I would like the motion to include just the caveat because I we had comment about that chokeholds and we know that we're moving some some things forward because we have to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But there was interest in going forward that this is not the end, this is just a step. But that that doesn't mean that we will not be taking future action as it relates to it. Can't wait and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Like that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Yeah. And as I noted earlier, the council will take action once we've heard from our subcommittees on a number of things. Yeah. Okay, great. All right. So we have a motion by Councilmember Odie. It's been circulated by Vice Mayor Knox White.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further discussion from our police and legal folks? Anything you want to add?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, thank you. No, thank you.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I have more quest questions that are kind of comments, but question the issue at the same time. Go ahead. Okay. So my my my question is, just because I wasn't I wasn't sure in terms of the email response that I got.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, did we spend $592,800 and then realize that we need to get 280,890 more? Or had we not yet spent the initial 592,800 and still realize that we need $280,000 more? Because I'm asking this question, because it seems to me is that if we spent 589,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': '$592,800 and then realized, oh, my gosh, we have to do 280,000 more. And I would have a kind of a problem with that because it would kind of speak to did we really carefully scope out what the what the issues were with regard to this this project?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's the first thing. The second thing is I will pay for it with the second thing in law, if we had not spent the $592,800 yet and still realize that we need 200 anymore, if if it's this situation, it seems to me, should we not put it out to rebidding?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So anyways, that's those are my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those are good questions. I had some of the same questions that I asked earlier, and I see that we have our city engineer, Scott Wickstrom on the screen. But City Manager Eric Leavitt, did you want to speak?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I'll just say real quick. Yes, it's I believe it was a 592 and that there were these issues which are outlined in the staff report, which Scott can definitely go into that created that we needed. We have had an excess on the project of 280,000 that we needed additional 280,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was not when the project started. It was as the project was ending that this occurred, this project one over time. I think this project was initially approved back in 2019. So Scott, if you could outline some of the issues that it faced that created this need that be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor, members of the Council, Scott Wickstrom, city engineer. Just a brief outline. And it was it's kind of halfway between your two options. Councilmember design. We got the project started, and shortly after we got out there and started drilling the foundations, we realized that we had some problems with some some some sand that were not characterized'",
        "'speaker_2': 'properly in our initial evaluation. And so we ended up spending a significant more amount of money on the foundations.

        "'speaker_2': '. That is certainly a communication issue that ultimately falls on public works. We're not getting that identified in advance for sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Okay. No, I just wanted to raise this question. Well, to me, I kind of felt the staff report wasn't clear as to whether or not we already spent it. And now we need more or we realize that, you know, it wasn't properly built out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think with the clarification that you provided, I understand. And and I do think that if staff can talk among themselves as to kind of internally, what kind of procedures you might take to kind of, you know, catch these situations earlier rather than later, because it seems as though you call it at the $592,800.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so and I recognize that, you know, things like this happen. And but, you know, we have to be very careful about the public's money. So unless anyone any other council members have any questions, I'm more than happy to move the staff's report.'",

Thus the final regulatory step in the city of Alameda is what we call the local operators permit, which has to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be re-upped every year. And then if they get their operator's permit, then they can they need to then finally get their state permits as well. So we in Alameda now have one dispensary in operation on Webster Street. We have the planning board has approved the second dispensary, but it hasn't opened yet on Webster Street, and they have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'approved the first dispensary on Park Street, which hasn't yet opened. And this is their approval of the fourth and final dispensary. Each of these use permit hearings, the planning board carefully considered the location proposed and the the compliance of the proposal with our local regulations and the findings to approve a conditional use permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What I'd like to do is just take a couple of minutes now to hit on some of the major issues that were raised by this particular application and were of concerns to some of the neighbors and the appellant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First and foremost, parking the. Some of the key issues here are that a our use permit process does not require that businesses needing use permits on park and Webster Street meet all of the parking regulations as as you know, most buildings and businesses on parking Webster Street don't have any parking at all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So our code doesn't require that when a property owner requests a use permit for their property, that they build parking. The parking is provided through. For most businesses in Alameda and our two commercial corridors is provided through our public, our supply of shared parking, parking meters, parking garages, parking lots.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The last three dispensaries were very typical of Park Street and Webster Street businesses. They had no parking at all. Those use permits were approved without any parking off street parking. In this case, the the site does allow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For Mr. Thomas, I hate to do this to you, but if you could wrap it up for 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, fantastic. The customer load, the number of of of customers that were proposed by this use was not a factor in the decision by the planning board. Essentially all use permits and we encourage businesses in the parking lots, the street and we have never limited or refused a use permit based on the number of customers that the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'use might bring. Last two points. Concern about crime. As I said, we have an operators permit. The operators permit has to be reissued every year. There's a security plan in place review that is associated with the operators permit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then finally, there's an issue about the 600 foot radius. This is a requirement of the operators permit the city. It's 600 feet under city and state law. The way you measure the 600 feet varies between city and state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But the state law allows us to make those distinctions if it's adopted by local law, which you did. With that, I'll wrap up my presentation. Obviously myself, David and Alan are available to answer questions as well as Celina, if you have any.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So at this point, does counsel have any clarifying questions for Mr. Thomas about what he said? Or should we going to hear from the appellant and then the applicant? Not seeing any hands up. So we'll keep keep moving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We will. We'll go ahead and move from the appellant first. And the appellant does have a PowerPoint to show. So if you'll give us a second to get the PowerPoint out, we will have that ready to go for him and then he can begin his 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And our appellant is Mr. and Rico.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Meyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Currently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correctly. I would thank you, Madam Clerk. Good evening, Mr. Meyer. And whenever you're ready to start speaking, I believe you can. And yourself you love.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'm ready.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dear Honorable Mark Ashcraft, the city council. The appeal of the youth permit on 2416, Lincoln Avenue is supported by more than 32 households. The program. The proposed party does not consider the adverse impact it would have on parking and safety in our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide, please. This is the affected neighborhood with more than 130, 330 households, several businesses in more than three blocks and slight. The Planning Board and the planning staff did not address two codes and did not alleviate concerns about the impact on the affected neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neighborhood incidents, citizens are all already negatively impacted by businesses and traffic. Next slide. This illustrates our concerns. The situation of our neighborhoods. No parking available. People park parking triathlons. The proprietary is frequently police needs to come out. In one real life case of one of all is upon us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you have prevented people from leaving on an emergency. I just frustration for people coming home from work and some of them need to park two blocks away from home. And course, speeding up and down on Lincoln Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide, please. This text of one a is a screenshot of the applicant submitted operations document. The applicant expects a 3220 customer visit, visiting twice in 28 days. It's shown in my calculations that are 223 visits per day, while those two are not three visits per day park or the outcome of bus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In all the states. It will be busiest on weekends and evenings and claims when most businesses are closed. Restaurant requires a camera right beside it, especially during this exact same times. Having more than half of people coming to it during those times.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How do we know that? Because when she buys a commerce clause on Mondays, you can be almost you can almost park where you want in our neighborhood. Next slide, please. This is the exact same one. A screenshot that states an incorrect calculation result of 223 visits per month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I consider this a poor, sloppy, mixed mistake at best. And deception to planning staff and planning boards and propaganda abuse of my opinion. Remember the slide before about the same base numbers calculated to turn out 25 visits per day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's like. As seen in the Applicants Orange Lines Daycare Center on 2415 Santa Clara Avenue, which close circle was within six feet of the canopies, six feet of the cannabis dispensary, which is the black circle. Import gave the approval for the dispensary and 2416 Lincoln Avenue in December 2019, which violated AMC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amnesty states a cannabis dispensary cannot be offered six. Some of the operators offered their case. Some argue that path traveled mentioned in the same NC is the way to measure. You can't have two different measurements in the same EMC definition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you insist on path travel, then not travel with a helicopter, which is less than six feet. Your last slide, please. Last night. We request this project if it's compliant to be stopped and alternatives to be discussed. We believe an allocation could be found to not adversely impact the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can stop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Oh, I see. Your time is up here, Mr. Mayor. All right, Council. Do you have any questions of Mr. Mayer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Cancer every day. Something that you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Was it 5 minutes or was that 3 minutes?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Quirk, your timing. It was five. Was that 5.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Minutes? Yes, we gave 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone have anything they want to ask? Mr. Mayor? I'm not seeing anywhere. Thank you for your presentation, Mr. Mayor. So with that, we will move on to the applicant. And who is speaking for the applicant?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I believe there are three of them who we will be promoting and they do not have a presentation. So we'll just get all three of them promoted and then they can start and we'll start their time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Okay. I see. It's too green. I believe it's Dr. Oram. And there's a third and that's just sound that. Okay. All right, whenever you're ready, the clip will start timing your five minute script.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, thank you. Hi, this is Shaun Oram and I am here to talk on behalf of NUG. Thank you, mayor and council members for this time. It is getting late and thank you for this opportunity. I would like to say just start by saying I was born and raised in Alameda and this project certainly holds a special'",
        "'speaker_2': 'place in my heart and I really am committed to making sure it is a successful project and that we are that Nuck is that we are in fact very good civic partners. We know was established about six years ago.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have since grown the company to over 200 employees and we have very successful and positive relationships in the cities that we currently work, and that is in Oakland, San Leandro, Sacramento and Redding. Currently, I actually I believe the mayor, Mayor Cotter from San Leandro and Councilmember Hernandez, also from San Leandro, wrote a letter to council and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the mayor in support. A couple of the issues that were raised. One, the typo that was pointed out in terms of the number of customers per day, that was strictly a typo. The correct math was just displayed there in terms of customers per month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in fact, the actual daily numbers were presented elsewhere in one of the exhibits. And then in the funny in the financial plans. So it is we are estimating around 200 daily customers in year one and growing to just over 300, maybe close to 400 in year four.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will say that that is very similar to the volume that we have currently in Sacramento at our retail store in Sacramento. The Sacramento store is also very similar in square footage and in parking numbers, and we are able to manage that customer flow on a daily that daily customer flow through the parking lot and through the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'facility with no congestion. Let's see. In terms of the operation operational radius, it is up to the city to determine the radius, the measurements for sensitive uses. And that is dictated in the in the in the ordinance. In the cannabis ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The the slide that was shown by the the appellant was taken from one of our site plans and that was just an engineer's drawing of what 600 feet looks like on a circle radius that was not intended to say, hey, this is how we measure 600 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was, in fact, just a schematic. And the actual measurement was made by the by the planning staff. In terms of how we're going to be enforcing parking and being a good neighbor. Well, we will not allow double parking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We will be using the parking lot primarily. We will likewise be promoting alternative transit or we're providing bike racks and we are providing discounts for consumers and benefits to employees who use alternative transport. So we are making a conscious effort to reduce the load of cars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do have a long list of local support, including the Chamber of Commerce, the Meals on Wheels and the downtown downtown business district with whom we've been involved with over the years. This has been a multi-year project, and we really are looking to bring this to completion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The if you if you recall, the site itself is a rather dilapidated building. It's been in a state of disrepair for four years. And we are prepared to put significant capital investment into that building and improve the facility and therefore the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And finally, I do want to point out that part of the issues we're seeing with with the the the booming of the illicit market in California and some of the issues around cannabis are, in fact, due to the slow process at the local level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in some cases, I guess for back for lack of a better word, for some NIMBYism. So we last year, the state reported that 3 to 1 illicit sales over overregulated sales. And we are going to keep having that kind of a problem until we are able to get very nice high end stores in accessible locations and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'allow people to purchase their cannabis in a very inviting and welcoming environment. And that is the mission of Nog and we will make that happen in Oakland. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We will make that happen in Alameda as we have in oakland, san leandro and Sacramento.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Doctor or in your 20 seconds, if anyone wanted to use them. Okay. So we have heard from the applicant. Now, is did counsel have any questions or comments? Now is our time, actually. Actually, let me just stop and ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Clerk, do we have any public speakers?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have four. So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So right now, let's take any clarifying questions about the staff record of the presentations, and then we'll hear from the public and then we'll come back into the break. Councilmember Desai, I see your hand up there next way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Two clarifying questions to the to the applicant. The first clarifying question is, how will the applicant prevent double parking? Do they contemplate having staff walk out beyond beyond the perimeters of the of the site and how?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the first question. How are they going to prevent double parking?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the facility, the entrance to the facility is in the front on Lincoln and at that very entrance will be one of our security guards. The state will have two security guards at all times. One of the security guards is meant to be focused at the entrance and so escorting people, customers in and out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other is focused on traffic flow, on the parking lot, and then certainly on monitoring the double parking. In addition, that security guard will be responsible for walking up and down the block and monitoring the safety and security of the surrounding neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's that's one that's the major mechanism for enforcement. The second mechanism is, in fact, that every customer that enters our facility for the first time, they must register with our system. And within our system is a good neighbor policy that includes no loud music, no double parking, no no fast driving, no smoking on site, no smoking'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Another question was how? How you will prevent double parking?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did yes. Yes. Thank you. Did you have another question, Councilmember?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, my second question and he might want to amplify clarify this is in terms of sales, someone buying something from the facility and then walking 25, 50 feet south of your easternmost border of your facility. So 25 feet in the direction of further in the direction of east of on Lincoln.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Beyond that, how do you prevent a person then selling the reselling the drugs to, say, minors?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So go back to the similar to my previous response. The security guard who is responsible for walking the neighborhood and the parking lot should be able to identify that and monitor that. And if in fact that is seen, they will stop the transaction report the name to to management, and we can block them from ever coming into'",
        "'speaker_2': 'our facility again. At the same time, our point of sale system and our customer relationship management system does track customer purchases. So if we see an unusual behavior in customer purchases, say, multiple visits in a single day or larger than average purchases, we can flag that particular customer and have conversations with that customer and then, if need'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be, prevent them from frequenting the store in the future. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So is there any limit to how far down the block your security guard, I guess the one who's not monitoring traffic and parking can travel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, we we did submit a map. And I think, you know, I don't know off the top of my head, maybe my engineer who's on the phone knows. But in general, we ask that the security guard use his discretion, his or her discretion and monitor the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if there's something, you know, towards the end of the block that looks curious, certainly it's well within his or her right to to go in and to go further down the block and monitor that. But it does need to be stated that their primary objective objective is on site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, they do need to monitor their time and their distance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because if they're going down the street to follow a customer who might be doing something they shouldn't, then they're not at the dispensary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's certainly a concern. And the two security guards main are in radio contact with each other and with the store manager so they can communicate if one needs to go elsewhere or, you know, handle a certain situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Jason, did you finish?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Those are my two questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Both. Very. Did I see your hand up or down? Okay. As the vice mayor, then councilor, really.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Got a couple of questions for staff. Actually, I wanted the good neighbor policy in the in the security plan is reviewed by the police department. Is that correct? Is that my memory correct? I think this is for Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're on mute.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, there are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for asking. Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And then the zoning. There was a lot of it. I wasn't here for it, but there was a lot of discussion about the zoning and making. Do we actually expand this past council expanded away from schools. This is within the approved zoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's for the you know, about the distances from schools and yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The point that's come up. So and I guess I'll save my comments for. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilor Brody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. My questions are actually for staff, whether it be Andrew or someone else. Do we have any any other businesses in town that we require have some plan to deal with double parking? No. No. We I mean, you know, we we we ask every every business to do what they can to make sure their customers do'",
        "'speaker_2': ', you know, be good citizens. But we don't have only the cannabis retailers have the security guards who are actively out on the street. And do we have any other businesses, say, like a pharmacy, that we require security guard to, like, follow people like maybe who buy opiates, opioids, opioids, whatever they're called, make sure they're not selling them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'down the street to some. Somebody second hand. No. Okay. And these are adult use. This is this is legal in Alameda, right? Yes. And there could be some medicinal use patients that, you know, decide they want to get their their cannabis in Alameda, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep. Okay. So, I mean, I say that, too, because I object to, you know, the terminology calling it a drug, because I think we've we've clarified that this is medicine and is permitted in Alameda. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've got a couple questions. So Dr. erm you mentioned that you thought the volume in Alameda would get up to about the level that this chapter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well we'll bring it back in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. My question is you I heard you say I think that you thought the volume would get here in Alameda would grow to about that of the Sacramento dispensary, around 400 customers a day. Does your have any parking spaces?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does your Sacramento dispensary have you to Dr..'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So to clarify, we generally were I was quoting the 202, about 300 in terms of average daily. 400 really does represent more of a peak volume. And that is what we, in fact, see in Sacramento. Sacramento store is almost exactly the same in terms of square footage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there are six parking spots at the Sacramento facility and a bike rack.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you. And this is for Andrew Thomas. If we communicate a little bit about this earlier, I understand that we don't require any of our businesses to provide off street parking and and we don't require our businesses to monitor for double parking, although that is something the police would certainly do if they had the bandwidth to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do it. But did you kind of play the deliveries? As I understand that just there's obviously deliveries to the dispensary of supply and product, but also couriers coming to pick up orders for customers who have ordered online. So what what's the how how is how are they handle?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because they have to park somewhere to commute. And I believe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That this is and David or Alan, please jump in, you know, a little bit more about the delivery aspects of the business, but this is not the first dispensary that provides to delivery in Alameda as well. And so it did not the fact that they had this as a service did not did not change our analysis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, it's as I was sort of saying at the top, it's really common for us to evaluate businesses and use permits where there is just no parking at all. In this case, they had five spaces which were just is somewhat unique for Park Street and Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we required the five spaces. We included some conditions about how those five spaces should be used. But the fact that they had a dispensary excuse me, a delivery service associated with their business did not affect our analysis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Is there anything that I should be added, Alan or David?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're both in your muted Alan. Yes. Yeah. That of me or members of the council or no. Director Thomas answered Very well. When we started this case, we also discovered that the restaurant next door also had deliveries. So really when we when we focus on the retail aspect of the use, it's this is really not unlike any'",
        "'speaker_2': 'other retail business on Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the the retail business being a space convert, the German restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be the restaurant and the other. Right. As well as some other retail.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. And I think they have a driveway to the restaurant where I would imagine deliveries might pull in. I will also note that in the correspondence Cindy called one of the owners of Spice a covered is is in favor of this project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Those are my questions. Okay. If we don't have any more clarifying questions, then. Okay. We're going to go to public comment, please. And I made a quick. How many public comments do we have?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have five.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So if it stays at five, everyone gets up to 3 minutes. Okay. I've heard Speaker Dennis Owens. Good evening, Mr. Owens. And just ten mutes that quite. He has the ability to vary. You're admitted. Good evening, Mr. Edwards.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Roberts, are you there? Um. I'm not sure if Mr. Owens is having technical difficulties. Should we take another speaker?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's. Let's go to the next speaker, and we can try and put him back in. But he looked like he was unmuted and we weren't getting any error messages. But next is Kathleen Prior.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello. Hello, Miss Pryor. And you just need to. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Hi. It's nice to see you all, Madam Mayor. And likewise. I'm Kate Pryor. I'm a board member of Elevated Meals on Wheels and a retired business owner. 28 years on Park Street. I've lived in Alameda all my life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would ask.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You to approve this project. This is a use that will benefit the city. The Park Street Retail District and Alameda Meals on Wheels. So it's a far better use of this building than anything I have seen in my 28 years as a business owner on Park Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that this is a very reputable company that. Believes in Alameda and will protect. What Alameda needs to have and. I urge you to continue. With this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you is prior. And our next speaker.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Throughout the process, a shop has incorporated neighbor practices in their planning. Their approval included conditions to mitigate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Parking.'",

We look forward to finally allowing them to move ahead with constructing aluminum nugget shop and their support of gold of the downtown Alameda Business Association and our district.

        "'speaker_3': 'Number of times and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We feel that will bring new vitality to the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Strip of the Lincoln Avenue. It is. It's going to be a beautiful space, I believe. And we really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are, again, very would be very happy if they would move in there. And.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Remodel this building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And make it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look. Much nicer. What is good for the neighborhood? And I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, I think that's all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much for listening. I appreciate it. Bye.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Cole.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We're going to try Dennis Owens again and see if he is he's made it again to try and meeting Mr. Owens.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Give it a try. And this is your volume up and all that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, no, it shows. It shows he's unmuted. And he had emailed earlier. So we were emailing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Madam Clerk, is there a number he can call into and do it through?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there is I will email that information to him and then the last speaker and then hopefully he could maybe change that really quick.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can we have one more speaker?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hell yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's going to look good. And battling synthetic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, yeah. Let's do that while you're getting that phone number. Okay, great. Good evening, Ms.. Sadek. If you would like to unmute yourself, we'd love to hear from you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. And Council members. My name is Madeleine Sadek, and I'm the President, CEO of Alameda Chamber of Commerce, and the shop is a member of our chamber and we strongly support that project because really it's a great time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, while all the businesses are struggling and suffering during this uncertain time to see a new business coming to our community, bringing a beacon of hope, bringing inspiration, blessed are investing a lot of money to enhance the beautiful building that they're working on now and the fact that they have a lot of job opportunities for people to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'work on. I think it's a great way and we tremendously support that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we received another speaker. Okay. So that ten minute now drops to 2 minutes because now we are over seven. And so the next one is Audra, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Hello, Ms.. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hello. Sorry about that. I didn't. I didn't realize I had to click Raise Count.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anyway, it's a little complicated. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. I would anyway. Good evening. My name is Audra. I've lived in Alameda my whole life, and my family has operated a business for decades, only steps away from Doug's address. My family owns the building where Doug hopes to open, but tonight I'm calling in as a residential neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I recently moved directly next door to the Doug property, and I'm eager to see the beautify and bring new life to this block, as they have consistently done at their other locations. I think it's also worth mentioning the building has been vacant, as some others mentioned, for as long as anyone remembers, and the renovations will be a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tasteful improvement and leave a lasting impression to all who visit the island. Aside from looks and boosting our local economy now will boost Doug will provide increased security, foot traffic, community involvement and charm to this sometimes overlooked portion of the Park Street business district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These contributions are why Doug has been met with an overwhelming amount of support from local business owners. The planning board, as you know, has given this project to unanimous votes as well. Please deny my neighbors appeal and allow now to move forward with our major investment in our neighborhood, in our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Miss Wright. And do we have Mr. Owens on the phone?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it looks like he's still on regular with his Henry. So I guess we could try one more time, because I sent the phone information, but only him the time we put it in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The third time as a charm. Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Owens, can you can you can you say something?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. I'm sorry. I just. I don't know what. We can't figure out what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would he like to email you his comments to read?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I think he had written comments. Let me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know you attach to all the correspondence. Let me take a quick look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'He did. He submitted written comments as well that are about three pages long. It starts on page ten of the attachment that's been posted. So his written comments are in the record.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Okay, great.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let's see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If I think. Yep, he supported. That's what I would say. I just give you the first line. Okay. And any further public speakers on this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are none.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. With that, I'm going to close public comment. And now it is time for the council to deliberate. Who wants to leave this question? Councilmember Daza, a quick question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think a mention was made of a report that this outfit will have to file, I think, annually. What is that report? And what if what if they don't meet certain standards or expectations and they report that in the report?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, what what what happens?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The I'll I'll answer. That's director Thomas the. The way the city of Alameda has regulatory structure set up every operator every retail dispensary must have two permits valid the use permit which runs with the land, which is what we're discussing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But they must also maintain a valid operator's permit. The operators permit is is issued by staff. The primary department is the police department. And that's where all the details, some of which for good reasons, you want to keep somewhat confidential.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You don't want to be distributing those security plans and making them public are reviewed every year by the police department, and that permit must be reissued every year. So it doesn't just automatically continue year after year after year.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the way that what that structure does is it gives the city a lot of leverage. If we start seeing crime issues or lack of of, you know, enforcement of of use, permit conditions or any of the CS requirements, we can contact the operator, say, hey, you have to take care of this problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If they don't take care of this problem, then they risk getting that operators permit renewed and it needs to be renewed every year. So this this was the council set up this structure back in 2018. And it's a model used in many cities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it gives cities an incredible amount of power to ensure that these operators are good neighbors, frankly. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, I have a question. I think this is for Mr. Swan, and we actually emails about this earlier today. But can you tell the council my question was, do the security guards carry guns or they are? And do you want to explain your answer to David Sloan?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Members of the council, David Weiner through the Planning Building, Transportation Department. And yeah, so the cannabis business regulations do allow but do not mandate security guards to carry firearms. As part of the cannabis business regulations, the chief of police can require any type of conditions or requirements for the public health and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'safety and welfare. And so with the existing dispensary on Webster Street, the applicant inquired about having armed guards. And Police Department's response at that time, was that referring to the regular on duty during business hours, guards would be unarmed, but as far as receiving shipments, which would be a similar use to an armored truck, that in those'",
        "'speaker_2': 'instances it would be okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you for that. I think I was a little alarmed at the vision of a security guard rushing down the block if they saw, I don't know, someone engaged in a sales transaction, I think that's probably an area we'd prefer someone call the police if they think something illegal is happening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you're saying that the guards who were stationed at the dispensary aren't going to be armed?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Get in there. I'm so sorry. Mr. Owens has managed to call in and would like to try again, if at all possible. I just mean, you know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We will counsel. Is that okay if we reopen public comment for 2 minutes? Do we need a vote on that or if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, you didn't really close it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think I did. Did I close public comment?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think I heard you say closing public comment. But.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Pope, whatever you say will do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think it's up to you guys if you want to accommodate them. It's great. I still don't know. It's either Hit Star nine or email me his last three digits so we know which phone number to promote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll close.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. We don't know which phone number to promote yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, unfortunately not. I thought you would get it to me or let me know you can it. Star nine Dennis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I. I am going to close public comment. We we I have looked at the three page letter that is among the attachments, among the exhibits, and it is 1012. And we still have some other matters to to hear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do know that it's a letter in support. So thank you for that. Okay. So what I was trying to say was any further questions or let's hear deliberation or what have you, who's who's first? And that's why.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then Councilmember Vela, then Councilmember Oti.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. I'll try to be short. I want to appreciate and thank both the appellant and the applicant for their easy, well organized five minute presentations. They didn't have any questions because I think the written material was very clear at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have to I believe we need to follow the rules that we set up and that it's not overly fair to ask people to go through, jump through hoops and follow rules and do everything and follow the processes that we fill out and then have kind of, you know, capricious decisions made at the end.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not I'm very aware that there are people in the area who are concerned. Cannabis is and is a very legal cannabis, a very new thing. And it's completely common sense that some people are going to be nervous about that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'However, I think that the Council in the past did a good job of setting up in general rules and protections, including the rule, the rule that was covered earlier by requiring a one year operating license. If they are bad operators, they will have spent a lot of money and find out that they are not going to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'operating in their second year. I don't think that's going to happen. We have heard from cities where they have worked that they are good community members. I'm not going to say partners. They're not partners with the city. They're just community members like Tuckers, Ice Cream and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I am here to support denying the appeal and allowing the project to move forward when my if my college colleagues are willing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilmember Village up next. And then Councilman Brody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was going to actually just make a motion to. Based off of the resolution to deny the appeal and approve the permit use application. And my reasoning for it is that I think the vice mayor laid it out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But essentially we spent a lot of time we had many, many meetings where we were discussing and formulating the process for applications, not just for people applying to eventually become one of our one of our chosen few dispensaries.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But then also around the locations we had, we had a number of other meetings where we we kind of did a deep dove into all of the concerns that have been raised. So it feels to me as though if we if we now change the standard on people after having so many meetings, public meetings on that would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be unfair. I also want to respect the work of our planning board. They put a lot of time and consideration into it. When they were looking at it, I thought they were very thoughtful and asked a lot of questions that were helpful in their process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I also want to note that in making my motion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we had a motion on the floor and your motion differs from that in that it also adopts the resolution denying the appeal. Is that just.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I wasn't clear on what the motion on the floor was. You're talking about might you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The vice mayor. The vice mayor made a motion and I'm just asking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, he didn't. He didn't. He didn't make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just said I was pretty disappointed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When he said he was ready to support it. So I went ahead and made the motion just so that we could we could go ahead and have the conversation and vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So you were your and Madam Clerk or maybe the city attorney. Can we do both the denial of the appeal and the adoption of the resolution on one vote?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. One vote. Two, yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that that motion has been made by Councilmember Vela. Is there a second council already? You had your hand up previously with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was both in and speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. You ready? Both.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I'll be brief, because I think both of my colleagues touched on the cat is covering my notes. Both. Both my colleagues covered a lot of things I was going to say. But I also, while I appreciate the work that the appellants did to present their case and presented it organized and concise, I didn't see anything in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there that would make me want to overturn a unanimous decision of the planning board. And I'm concerned that we would be asking this business to be subject to more restrictions on different items, whether it be double parking or whether it be security that we're not subjecting any other business to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, for example, when the Walgreens was there, I could have I haven't, but I could have gotten gotten a prescription of oxy and sold it in the in the parking lot. And there was no requirement that Walgreens monitored my activities once I left the shop.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have given used permits to three other potential will one acting and two potential cannabis businesses without requiring additional cumbersome things like dealing with double parking and for doing the job of the police department. And lastly, I think we should be careful about the words we use.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is a commodity that was legalized by the voters of the state of California that was regulated by the state legislature. That medicinal use was has been permitted for over 20 years, although it didn't get regulated until just recently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to be calling it a drug, I think harkens back to, you know, the sixties, in the seventies and, you know, kind of the reefer madness, you know, persona and know stereotype of cannabis and, you know, and, you know, this is a business, an established business, you know, with financial backing and a business plan and everything.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to use the term outfit, which kind of, you know, brings back, you know, when I was a kid, we call the mob the outfit, you know, and the mom, you know, kind of did drugs dealing. So I think it kind of reinforces stereotypes that make me feel super uncomfortable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think we need to move off of those stereotypes and be careful with our language. And like I said, I second that. And so I'm happy to to vote, to deny the appeal and uphold the unanimous decision of the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And just for clarification, in denying the appeal, approving the use permit that is subject to the modification, the modified conditions of approval, because as we know from the staff report, the the closing hour was actually that was granted by the planning board was actually an hour later than the the ordinance allows.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So that's all in there. Okay. Any further discussion? Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Yeah. You know, I don't think that we have as a city properly characterize the built environment impacts of outfits such as medical marijuana dispensaries. I don't think we've adequately characterized it because I think the traffic impacts of these are much more than than we realize.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As you all know, I live two, two houses down from the Webster Street Medical Merit Medical Marijuana dispensary. And I can tell you that that the traffic impacts are pretty high, but they're also unique in that what you often have is you have people drive and then they park their cars and they keep their their cars running'",
        "'speaker_6': 'because they have their partner in the car. Then they go in and then they get their their their drugs and then they go into their car and then they go. In my area, I don't really see double parking that much, but I do see a high confluence of this kind of kind of vehicular traffic activity going on'",
        "'speaker_6': '. The other thing that I do see in my area is I do see a lot of the cars will come in from Webster Street, make a left on the Haight Avenue, and then after they park, then they do a U-turn back on to Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, I would say that that's something that could also happen here on on Lincoln Avenue, that you can see this kind of vehicular activity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I will say.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This much, especially to the restaurant owners, because they've done such an incredible job in putting Alameda on the map with their restaurants. So we certainly appreciate it. From what I can tell, based upon my experience, I live right there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think this actually will turn out to be more of a burden than the restaurant owners realize because it's going to take up so much of the parking. So even though the parking is kind of on a quick turnaround basis, people don't you know, people don't park there for 30 minutes, but there's a lot of cars coming'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in. And so it's going to and it's going to be especially difficult for the residents and the businesses there right now, especially around 4:00 to 7:00. Trust me, this is going to impact you guys, business owners and also residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think that this street really is is is the type of street that you want this kind of activity on. I think we need to relook at the way in which this kind of activity is really this high vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thriving kind of activity. And we and we do that kind of we do have land use policies based upon things that the varying degrees of of of vehicular activity. So that's one concern. The other concern, quite frankly, is that I suspect that in my area, the entity probably also has some kind of, you know, plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But after a period of time, they don't walk down the street. They don't you know, they just don't do it. And I don't see quite frankly, I don't see a lot of of people reselling drugs. I don't see that a lot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I do see it. But I don't I'm not going to say it. It happens every day. I'm not going to say it happens every week. I'm not going to say it happens every three weeks, but it does happen.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, I think we we we need to be aware of that reality. So based upon my personal experience of living two houses down from a from a medical dispensary, I just I don't think this is going to fit the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, in fact, I, I strongly suspect that that that even the even the restaurant will realize soon realize that that this might not be helping them out. So and I just want to say quickly, I believe. Ms.. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I suspect her parents for a long time are business owners on what's the street as well. So I just want to say shout out, say thank you very much to her parents as well for for for many years of contributing to to Webster Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So that's it. So I'm going to support the residents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel over there so I can severability with your this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I just since we're getting into allegorical stories. As somebody who walks down Webster Street literally seven days a week with my 16 month old son. I've walked past the dispensary there a number of times. I haven't seen a single nefarious thing happen in the many times that I've walked by to live in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to be very careful and cautious about coming out saying that we've seen crimes happen or that we're witnessing drug dealing or things of that nature. Without having without having police reports or anything else to back it up, I just I think that's very dangerous territory to go down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I also want to point out that in the time of COVID 19, we've seen a lot of people I've seen a lot of people run in and out of their cars with people in the cars picking up food.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have a lot of restaurants in both of these areas. And so I think that there's certainly behavior that could improve. We could work on double parking and all of our business districts we can work on on some of these issues.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But these aren't behaviors that I have witnessed, particular to a dispensary, but more kind of behaviors across the board that that we're trying to work on. So I just I think we need to act based off of data and that and based off of the policies that we've set.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there was a lot of discussion. And so with that imaginary I know you still have your comments, so thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I have made the comments that we make. All right. We've had a motion. It's been seconded. We've had discussion. Maybe we have a roll call. Oh, are we clear on the motion?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Deny.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yeah, if you want to know. Andrew Thomas, may I ask you to explain with the vote?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think the motion on the floor is to uphold the Planning Board's decision to approve and deny the appeal. So, yes, if you vote yes, you're upholding the planning board. If you vote no, you are voting with the appellant makes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It and if any further questions everyone ready to vote? Let's do it then we have a roll call vote with.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Good evening, Mayor. As the Ashcroft vice mayor, not white members of council, this is an update. It's a recommendation to receive an update on our procurement process for the Integrated Waste Franchise Agreement that we've been negotiating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As you all know, that covers our waste recycling and compost services that happen in the city. It's a it's an important agreement. It does affect all residents and businesses in the community. It's also important because it's a pretty significant cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's currently running around $20 million a year, and the duration for these contracts can exceed ten years. They can go along at 20 years, which is as long as our current franchise agreement is running for. So it's a significant cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It also helps us achieve some pretty fundamental goals for the city. Our Climate Action Plan has goals associated with our franchise agreement, and there are new laws coming down on a regular basis related to zero waste and other waste management initiatives.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's an important agreement for us. And I'm also we're also going to share the results of a customer satisfaction survey that we had done. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Liz Acord, our public works coordinator extraordinaire.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So since we've updated you in July, we've continued to meet with ECI with a focus on scoping programs in the new agreement and completing the detailed cost forms. We were hoping to have more information to share with you this evening regarding cost proposals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unfortunately, due to the recent fires, our schedule has been slightly delayed and we do not currently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The firm cost parameters to share with you. So as such, we aren't able to provide more of a robust status update this evening other than to say that we are still underway. And I think importantly that at this time the schedule delays are not of great concern to staff working closely with ACA to keep moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that update, I will now turn it over to Curt with F.M. three and then the curtain. I, as well as Rob Hilton with age up and age, will be available afterwards for any questions that you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Oops. So. There we go. All right. Great. Thank you, Liz. And good evening, Mayor. Members of the council. Nice to see you again virtually. I'm a little SFM three research and I'm going to go through some highlights from the survey we conducted this summer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This go to the next slide. So a quick note about our methodology. We were given a list of customers provided by MCI that had residential customers and a smaller subset of commercial customers. We gave the same survey basically to both sets of respondents there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the residential customers, we did offer English, Spanish and Chinese per other recent surveys conducted for the city and and like the same methodology, we offered respondents an opportunity to take the survey both online and on the telephone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the residential survey, we did a little over 500 interviews, so roughly four and a half percent margin of sampling error. The margin of error for the commercial customers is large, so don't worry about that as much. Go to the next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to kind of put a little bit of an introduction on what we're going to go through here. The slide deck is longer, but I'm just doing the first several high level slides focused specifically on the residential customers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll touch just briefly on the the results of the commercial customers responses that are in more detail in the appendix. And they've been very, very dramatically here. So with that, let's get to the slides. And I think that they're all going to sound pretty consistent.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the next slide. We shall see the so the residential customer reviews slide five here we presented a random order, whether on the phone or online, a different utilities and quasi utilities that residential customers here might interact with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we asked them, well, do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of them? The shades of green or favorable opinions, shades of red or unfavorable? The darker the color, the more intense the feeling. And you'll see here that Alameda County Industries, I mean, this use the name itself, 83% of residential customers had a positive or favorable'",
        "'speaker_2': 'impression of them. Only 11% had an unfavorable impression. So this is a really high number and significantly outpaced utilities like PPG, ENI and Comcast. Next slide, please. So one way of asking about this is by name. In the event that people weren't as familiar with ACR by name, we also asked basically by service and we asked, How'",
        "'speaker_2': 'satisfied are you with these different services electricity, natural gas, your waste and Internet? And you'll see here that a pretty similar number here, 89% said that they were satisfied with their garbage recycling or organics removal, including 56% who were very satisfied.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So satisfaction levels were were very high as they were for electricity and natural gas. We often see this in other communities when we ask about waste disposal services. Next slide, please. We also asked, well, rates, do you feel that what you're paying is reasonable for those same for services and you'll see here that there's a pretty high'",
        "'speaker_2': 'positive numbers there as well. You essentially have three quarters or more who thought that electricity rates, natural gas rates and waste disposal rates were reasonable. 74% specifically for garbage recycling, not against removal. Much more of a split opinion on the Internet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's not the topic of this particular survey. But you see here, again, favorable impressions of ECI. Favorable impressions. Satisfaction levels are high for the service and three quarters of respondents feel like what they're paying is at least somewhat reasonable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Next slide, please. We did ask an open ended question. So if you said that you are satisfied with your waste removal services, we said, well, tell us in your own words or type in your own words why? And then for those of you of ten, some of our surveys like this, before, we do our best to kind'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of put things in the categories and you'll see the reliability was the top of the list. More than half of those who were satisfied cited reliability as one of the reasons for explaining it. And also just generally do a good job and the customer services is solid as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'These numbers do add up to more than 100% because an individual could have mentioned many different rationale for being satisfied. The next slide, please. This is for only that sliver. You know, roughly 10% of us who had any sort of negative things to say or satisfaction levels were negative and tip top of the cap to your staff'",
        "'speaker_2': 'who suggested that one of these items might be on the list, which has been problems. They seem to have a pretty good pulse on things. But of those who were dissatisfied, putting the bins were creating a mess after pick up was one of the things that they mentioned and also some concerns about rates.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So while overall there's not a lot of concern about rates that most people feel like they're reasonable, those who do have some levels of dissatisfaction, the rates seem to be one of the contributing factors. Now, keeping in mind this slide, that this is only of those who are dissatisfied, which is a pretty small percentage of residential customers'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Next slide, please. We did asked respondents to unpack a few specific elements of the services here. So picking up the carts on the service day, providing instructions about what goes where. Responding to questions, you know, customer service essentially, and picking up illegal dumping.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we see for those first three categories, the satisfaction levels, again, were consistently high, particularly for picking up on there on the data. So the reliability issue, we saw that a couple of places in here. Customer service and instructions, that's actually positive in other communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That can be a little confusing with the different bins and and whatnot. Illegal dumping. This sort of stuck out here as something that the satisfaction levels were low but sort of satisfaction because that gray bar is huge. 60% said I don't know what's the takeaway could be that there's a lot of residential customers don't really understand that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'HCI plays a role at all in picking up illegal dumping. Next slide. So this kind of wraps up the presentation here, at least for the part I was planning on going over here. But overall, positive impressions feel like I was doing a good job.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Feel good paying for is reasonable. The only real material concerns were around costs and leaving a mess or having bins put in weird places after a pick up here. But those were a distinct minority of respondents. Not a lot of understanding of their side does play a role in addressing the legal dumping.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We did also ask a couple of other questions I didn't cover here that you'll see later on in the survey, but I just touch on them here, just for brevity sake here. We did ask about keeping us an office in Alameda, and there was broad support for that, as well as hiring someone to help educate customers here'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And even though we did say that those things might cost a few extra dollars on their bills, we did go through a variety of other recently adopted or proposals you're considering. Regarding waste reduction. I touched on that a little bit here in his introduction there, and I think the response is there are roughly two thirds or more'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of all the residential respondents supported all those different policies that have either been recently adopted or are being considered here. Some of the ones that had the highest levels of support were supplying recycling organics containers in public areas and having giving renters a free, annual, bulky pick up in terms of the commercial customers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, I'm not going to go over that in detail because there were very similar responses or just distinctions and in intensity. There was one exception in there, and this is, again, only 50 people or companies were able to get a hold of one of those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a little more the vision about whether or not to charge a fee to residents of businesses who do not properly for their compostable or recyclable material. Support levels for that policy proposal were much higher among residential customers and roughly an even split among commercial customers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that in mind, that brings us to the end of the presentation. I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Big. Thank you, Mr. Gallo. Councilmember Desai, I see your handout.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a quick question. Was there ever a variable that was satisfied? You have very satisfied and you have somewhat satisfied. Was there ever a variable that was just satisfied?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're a musician?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So the way we structure that question is that we ask initially, are you satisfied or dissatisfied? And then as a follow up, we say, well, is that very or somewhat? So if you aggregate those together, that would be the total satisfaction number.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we try to push people a little bit to the different intensity levels. Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hey, everybody.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. You mentioned about having the office, and one of the reasons I like it is that that's where you drop off your batteries if there was no office. Now, what would people do with their batteries? Do we do we know this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is, of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Course, something that we can explore as a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Contract component.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For an alternative pickup resource?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, I'm not advocating closing the office. I'm just saying, you know, that's one of the benefits of having an office. Not to mention, if you're late on your bill, you can run it down there without having to travel to another city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then the other question I know well, two questions. I know that. And it's tough place. We talk a lot about, you know, the diversion rates in multi-family units. And I appreciate that there was that. The need for a bulk pickup because sometimes those bins fill up as someone needs to live in a multifamily unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We working with staff, waste it all on helping achieve their goals and improving the diversion rates at at these multifamily units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rob, I'm going to ask you to jump in on that one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, counsel. Yes, that is one of the things that we're we're looking at a combination of solutions for. The multifamily generators as well as our our commercial generators. And that's part of the question that was in the survey about providing a staff resource to go out and provide some technical assistance from the multifamily property owners or'",
        "'speaker_2': 'managers. And the the businesses need a little bit more hand-holding because their waste needs are more complicated than they are in in the residential single family environment. So that's a piece of why we're looking at that. And it's also a piece of why we're looking at that that bulk item program to prevent illegal dumping.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Will you just introduce yourself? Tell us your affiliation, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. Rob Helton with age. I have an age consultancy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I appreciate that. Because they're also newer to, you know, the sorting, you know, relative to, you know, single family residence. In the last question, there was a bullet point about enforcement. And I know that some police, they have some programs where, believe it or not, there's cameras in the bins and you can see what goes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in and tell whether it belongs or it doesn't belong there. And, you know, have we reached out to stop ways to work on some of these enforcement things? Because, you know, they can actually enforce, you know, issues with people sorting and not sorting property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's a suggestion. And any other, you know, benefit. I didn't ask if we had public speakers, but we're still on the council clarifying questions, I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do not have any public comment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or public comment. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry. That was kind of a question to see if there's been any. I'd be happy to jump in and respond to that. So the sister company to ECI is the one that did that pilot project that you probably heard about at the Stop Waste meeting out in Livermore.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so we've got some really good data from that. And it's one of the things, as we're talking to them about the contamination, monitoring and management that we can introduce into the discussion. The the challenge with that program is the cost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So each of those cameras in the bins has its own cellular service attached to it, and it's got a monthly fee attached to that. So as you saw, one of the concerns was related to the rate impact of things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And obviously, as we're negotiating the contract, one of our concerns is about the rate impact of things. So, you know, as in the Livermore situation, it may be a targeted approach to using that, but I like the idea and we could definitely bring that up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It seems to me you talked about the education piece. I think some more resources directed toward customer education might go a long way to and probably be less costly, although that's kind of intriguing about the camera in the barn I just can picture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Does anyone remember Oscar the Grouch from Sesame Street? Dave just writing about the garbage cans and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's pretty much how it is. Yeah, I watch some of the video entertaining, but. Yeah, well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll have to we'll have to see that other comments questions council. Councilmember Daza. And twice.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a quick question. So is it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Staff's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Request that the council consider doing a Sol, doing the contract, you know, completing the contract for the next 20 years on a sole source basis? So as opposed to going out for an RFP, is that the bottom line recommendation?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know, the the conversation tonight is really just an update. We were with counsel starting in February of 2020 to discuss the sole source versus not sole source. And we were exploring the negotiations with API. And if that was not going to work, then we were going to shift to a competitive bid process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what we are finding is that the negotiations are going well with API. We don't have those numbers that we were hoping to have this evening. Our public works coordinator, Liz Acord, made reference to it in her comments.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There have been just some unfortunate personal situations that have arisen because of some of the fires where some of our API folks, and so they just need a little more time to develop those numbers. But the sole source negotiations are going reasonably well at this time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're not talking about another we're not talking about a 20 year term for this contract. It will be shorter. We can't we don't know the exact numbers yet. It affects the rates that will be bringing forward for council consideration.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we can stretch out the amortization frame for for the equipment and things like that, it helps it helps the rate structure. But there's certainly a lot of good momentum right now, positive momentum in our sole source discussions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there isn't, at least at this time, any thought to shifting gears and going to that competitive process. If things change, we'll certainly be back to report, back to council and talk that through the burden.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any further questions from council? So this is a report for us to receive, as I recall. Um, anything anyone wants to add with me or next week?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. It was a good, good report. And I appreciate it. The survey data as as as was noted bin placement know rated about where you would expect it to be based on the comments we read done online and the emails we receive as we're going through the discussions and whatever else.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think looking for a metric that might relate to, you know, I'm not looking for perfect bin placement, but I can definitely say there are some times I come home and wonder what the heck happened with the bins, you know, that somebody must have picked up the bins and move them half a house up multiple of them'",
        "'speaker_5': '. It doesn't quite align with, with, with my experience with what I would expect of the thing is just picking up and putting it down over and over again. So I just wondering if there is some way to to address some of that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the other hand, it is very clear that ECI is getting fairly high approvals. And I and I don't make these comments as if somehow they are doing a terrible job. I'm just saying, if there was a place for improvement and I think the single family homes that they that would probably be the one that we hear'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the most about. And so thinking about through our conversations with them, how we might address that would be great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'll just say this is anecdotal, but it's personal information out there. You know, every once in a while, not very often a Ben or two don't get picked up at our house. And I've always found this guy, folks at the office, when you call to be just top notch and pleasant and efficient'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and they're out there, you know, as soon as they can be. And I don't know. I always think it's kind of miraculous to get your bins out and then, voila, there, they're empty when you come home. And I'm also aware that in many cities, and I'm sure Asia is having these challenges, you know, some places are picking'",
        "'speaker_0': 'up glass. They're not accepting glass for recycling anymore. And they're limiting what, you know, what they will take. So, you know, so far we've had we've managed to keep doing what we did. But this is a challenging market.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Well, if there is nothing further that people want to add. Okay. We won't quite move along.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Heard everything that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think the one comment that I always have to double check now, the one comment I would make is, you know, even if it's not a 20 year contract, let's suppose it is, it's a ten year contract. I have to you know, I mean, at a minimum, the value of that contract is going to be $200 million'",
        "'speaker_6': 'over ten years timeframe. It's hard for me to see a sole source contract even as good as ACA is. I. I just think you have to test the market, so. But. But don't get me wrong. I think ACA does a good job from what I can tell.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it that aside, I think you still have to test the market. But I'll leave it at that. That's my opinion. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Anything further from any would be okay with that? Um, we, we have received the update and I will close this item. Thank you all for for being here for your presentations. Good to see you guys. Mr. Burton.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good see you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Have a good night.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Is not. Council member of the PPC recently revised its regulations regarding the public generally exception and there is a specific ban there that's called limited neighborhood effects. And the new decision makes clear that a city's decision affecting residential property is limited.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If it's limited to specific locations encompassing more than 50 homes, which I believe that this program would be, and that the decision establishes, amend or eliminate restrictions on parking, imposes traffic controls or other measures to improve public safety that the member may participate and fall under the public section public generally exception.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We bring it to you every year. But this year's report really also included a lot of information on something we didn't plan to do this year. But we've been putting a lot of time into, which is all of our COVID 19 Slow Streets Commercial Streets program.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we provide you information on those programs as an update. There are really two actions tonight. One is we're seeking your authorization to waive the encroachment permits for the Slow Streets program, the Commercial Streets program. That's just really a business trying to help out the local businesses on Park Street and Webster Street.'",

And then we're also looking to get your support for a to for us to set aside $75,000 as a local match for an TC grant for another $75,000, which would give us $150,000, which would it's a grant that would allow'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Just a couple of questions. Thank you. I guess my question is and then I'll wait to hear from my colleagues. Back in May, we approved a slow street map for rolling out so streets. Are we done with that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we rolled out everything that's on that map.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rochelle or Scott, do you want to address the Slow Street? Michelle Wheeler and Scott Wickstrom have really been instrumental in the Slow Streets program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As we were. I'll go ahead. Yeah. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor. And Council. I can't recall what exactly was on the May map, because we've revised the map since then and we have added additional closed streets from the original couple of ones that we implemented first. So but we still have additional slow streets that we're looking to expand to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is that that map is the one that's on our current on the website currently.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So do we know how that map compares to what we what what came before us? I think in May or whenever that was. I haven't had time to look, I'm sorry to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that I'm trying to remember what was in May. Things have changed. So I can I can look that up. Scott, do you happen to remember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a long time ago?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Yeah, I remember my memories. There are more there were more streets than are currently implemented. And I guess I'm just curious if that is correct. And we have survey data that says 72% of people like this thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Why we didn't. Do the thing. The council said, let's do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh huh. Uh huh. Well, we have completed all of first CI.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Pacific and then San.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jose. I think there was a little more that maybe has not been done as my is my recollection. And then there's some additional areas that we're now proposing to do as well beyond what we showed in May.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Knock it off you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think it's a.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Cast member, Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks. My question. And I think that I'd met with the folks at ABC and they noted that there was no slow street over at the point. And I didn't see anything in here in this report that we were going to be doing this whole street out of Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wonder what the status is on that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have received a request from APC to allow me two point collaborative to put a slow rate on Orion, and that's something we had started talking about. However, there is a bus route on Orion, and so we're not you know, generally our Slow Streets program is looking not to put slow streets on transit streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So but we are actively talking about that right now and looking at what we could do out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I appreciate that, because that's a neighborhood of the city, too, that, you know, does not shouldn't be ignored. So thank you. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And who else? Castro. Rivera.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just following up on my colleague's questions, I think, you know, what I would like to know is when when these changes get made, where is the update and the review from council and what's the timeline on that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I think if we if we think about it, we've been in the pandemic for several months and in particular with APEC, where we have a lot of traffic going through for the launch, the U.S. launch pick up as well as the the food bank.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do have a concern that we're taking a lot of time to make these assessments. And I think that there's also a concern, at least on my end, if some of these bus routes are still active or as active during the pandemic, because we know that the transit has also cut back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if I could, there's a few questions there. But if I could get some answers on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we're. I apologize. I think we're having technical difficulties with with Scott, who can help us answer some of these questions. But what I'm hearing what I'm hearing is the council is very supportive of the Slow Streets program, would like to see expansions of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think what we could offer tonight is to give you provide an A. Yeah, I just got another text. He's still unable to get in, so but what we can do is we can prepare a off agenda, a report or a report for a upcoming agenda, you know, very soon sort of giving you the most current'",
        "'speaker_2': 'update on our plans for expansion of the Slow Street program, which streets were seriously considering? I know that, you know, it's between public works and transportation planning. We are feeling very overextended with everything that's going on. And that's just just I mean, that's not an excuse.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's not to say agitation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are just so you know, when you're like, oh, expand it. Let's do more. Let's do more. It's a bunch of us get all grumpy. But we we hear you. We know it's a successful program. We know that Alameda and Alameda residents have really appreciated it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let us let us kind of regroup. I think if I've characterized the consensus of the council correctly that you you do like this program, you would like to see us try to continue to expand it. The West End and the collaborative, obviously, I heard that tonight as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what we can do is we can bring back the map. We can also bring back the comparison to the May map, which I'm sorry, we just weren't ready and prepared to to do the comparison. But we can kind of tell you how things have changed over the program and and what we think would be possible to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do in the very near future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And interject. Yeah, I would say it looks like our great junior Scott has found his voice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I do. I am on radio and I can at least on the phone here, although not on video. Just to answer Councilmember Knox Dwight's question about the STS rollout and implementation, we did a really obviously a concerted push in May, June as we get the program rolled out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then we basically, I'll say, diverted our limited attention, as Andrew saying, towards the commercial streets. And I think as the commercial STS has been very successful getting a lot of PARKLETS out there, there are some additional expansion possibilities with the residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are a couple additional phases that are potentially out there that we are looking to implement in the coming weeks and months. So that is that is something we have not forgotten about and particularly the area out over in Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Wickstrom. I think that's a good reminder that, you know, we don't have a huge staff in the city. And so oftentimes the same cohort are working on many different things. And, you know, there still are only 24 hours in the day and you can't work on all of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with the streets, I'm a fan and I've really enjoyed walking and riding my bike and I take all of them now. And the only thing that I would ask is communication is really important. And when residents don't get the word until the signs are going up in front of their home or business, then we hear from'",
        "'speaker_0': 'them. And so just, you know, people people want to be informed ahead of time and communication goes a long way. So that would be my request. Anything else on the. Well, I guess what I'll just jump in and say is that sorry, I have Grossman's temperamental iPad and sometimes it lets me up and staff reported at the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'time tonight but what I'll say because I'm going to have with this one is I did appreciate the the have to really take a deep breath so I don't say something specific but oh there it came back. I do appreciate the the recommendation that we delay the short term temporary special event street closures along major commercial inside'",
        "'speaker_0': 'streets because the county public health officer has said no large gatherings and also. We do need to keep our COVID numbers under control. And we've done really well. And I want to congratulate our meetings and I think staff has done a great job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as I'm reinforcing the message and yet there's still you know, people seem to think that this is you know, it's now passed. And we don't have to worry. We do have to worry. We're going into the the winter season.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so this is the time to really protect ourselves, I think. I know over the weekend a couple of us came upon a swap meet happening out of Alameda Point, which you know that with the report of a karaoke party at one of our yacht clubs on the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'These are not things you shouldn't be happening right now. And so certainly street fairs, Halloween fairs, we just have to you know, this is a year like no other. We've got to get past COVID so that we can reopen our businesses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so thank you for that. The suggestion about the pause of the street closures. Vice Mayor Wait.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess I'll take a slightly different tack on that, but I want to start with I did listen to the Transportation Commission meeting last that where that where the actual status report went over and I passed this along.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not sure how far went, but I just wanted to thank staff for all the incredible work that's been done really well, laid out and presented a work and answering questions in a way that was really useful to the team members and the public myself as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just clear that a ton of work is getting done and I don't want to suggest that I do find myself a little, you know, in the second year ties into the beginning of my meeting comments as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think the council gave some direction in May related to rollout of streets based on a map and related to actually closing down commercial streets early in the summer to support some of our businesses at a time when we did it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I think if we're going to make decisions not to do those things or to delay them or whatnot, I think it would be good to at least have some communication back to the council so that we're aware that that work is not moving forward, especially since it's probably in reaction to other work we're asking to be'",
        "'speaker_5': 'done because we do have a small, small staff. I do know in May we we we pushed up the transportation plan a few months in order to support the slow steps so street so I think we're working on communicating about about tradeoffs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I do think it would be good to just make sure that there's better communication because until tonight, we haven't had the opportunity to hear that, that, you know, not only have we not done it, but there's a recommendation that we not do it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, for me, again, great appreciation for all the work that's been done. But five months after after we asked that it be done, I think that some that could have been communicated maybe just a little bit more clearly at that point in time, because we talked about it through the summer as well, that that's just'",
        "'speaker_5': 'minor feedback. Again, I do want to with the reading through the transportation report, I think it's good and it's clear that a lot of work in very difficult times has being done. And I really appreciate it. So thank you for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Express Mayor. I see councilmember hand that followed by Councilor Rody.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also have a temperamental iPad. So I sympathize with the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe just kidding with each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Probably same model. So, you know, my my thing is, I think that there's just communication it's communication improvements that we can point to, not just here, but with a number of other things that have happened during the pandemic and not related to the pandemic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we can always improve communications both with the council and then also with with the public in general. I know a lot of people are excited about the reopening, but there's still a lot of misinformation about what's permitted and what's not permitted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm hearing about different groups getting together for kind of neighborhood events and things like that being publicized. And so I think we need to do a better job of kind of letting people know what's allowed and what's prohibited even outside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that this this oftentimes it's not just our commercial streets. It's also, like I said, in our residential neighborhoods where people want to get it get together for different types of events. So I think we obviously have a lot of information on our website.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But one of the things that I found is that a lot of people don't know to go to our website, even though we're promoting it on social media, and the mayor's talking about it at her town halls and we're sending information out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think this is a larger kind of issue. I don't necessarily want to put it all on our transportation and planning, folks, because I think it's just kind of part of a bigger communication strategy that we need to figure out as a city, both during the pandemic and outside of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then I think, you know, I'm fine. Andrew Within and off agenda update. I think that that's great. Not everything has to be on the agenda, but I think these council offices are very helpful, especially because sometimes these things keep coming up in different forums or meetings with like the business community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it would be helpful if we can also relay the we can all be on the same page and relay the same message that people stop asking for the same things. And we can we can explain to them why certain things aren't happening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So at least from my perspective, I want to be a helpful ambassador when I go to these meetings. I know my colleagues feel the same way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Why Republicans were voting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just want to share my appreciation to our staff and our transportation team that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've accepted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of them before COVID and even after COVID. And I realize there's a limited number of resources, but I think they've stepped up and and been responsive to the council in response to the community as far as the Commercial Street closure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now, I had a chance to walk Park Street with Kathy Webber, and we were surveying the different businesses, you know, those that were there about what they thought about potential street closures of Park Street. And it was all over the map.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I understand that, you know, there's really not a consensus of the merchants on whether they feel, you know, permanent or temporary or once, once a month or two days a month or whatever is even something that could do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I still think it'd be interesting to try a pilot because, you know, we have closed Park Street and Webster Street in the past. We're street fairs. So there's no reason why we couldn't try something in the future where we can close it and just make it walkable, you know, for 8 hours or 10 hours or, you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'know, one day, one day just to see what happens. And, you know, what what are the lessons learned? You know, I've heard from people on Haight Street, you know, that they're they're unhappy with that street, you know, being kind of a a cut through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And, you know, that street may be a viable alternative. It's on the list. But, you know, with the. Know, with the farmer's market and such, you know, there are some days where it's partially closed. So from the neighbors I've talked to, you know, they would appreciate, you know, also it being closed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But, you know, maybe we shouldn't foreclose the idea of doing it. And Taylor, because I haven't talked to anyone on Taylor, but I'm sure that they would appreciate, you know, the same type of safety measures that we've been able to implement on other safe streets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, again, just appreciation to our staff, our transportation staff. And I, I know we ask a lot of you and I just want to make sure you know that I know that we ask a lot of you, but I also appreciate everything that you're able to do.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And Councilmember Eddy, if the cat wants to speak, I'll give him 2 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, well, this is not the one that usually video bums the meeting, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He has to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rule down Pat.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alford. Okay, what else? Council. So we make this to make this recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor? Mayor. Madam Mayor, may I? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll get back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To the question that the vice mayor asked earlier. Oh, sure, yeah. Because I've had a chance to look up what we actually brought back in May to the council. And so at that point, we had already implemented just two short segments of of two streets as low streets, which were for and Pacific.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what we brought to council was a map that included expanding into a phase two. So from the pilot slash phase one A to a phase two, which included extending Pacific Avenue and adding Santa Clara. So we've done that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then since then we've added a phase three which completed Vici and then also added San Jose. And so the map we brought you in, May, there are still some areas that are kind of future under consideration that we have not yet implemented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And but we do now have 4.5 miles of slow streets in the city and these future phases that are under consideration. The intent is to create kind of link up these different slow streets so you have more of a network.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that is that is what is ahead of us. And we are looking at streets like Haight and Taylor and trying to figure out which one to add. Plus looking out at now at Alameda Point and also looking at Bay Farm Island.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so we haven't done everything that was on that original map, but we definitely have moved it forward significantly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And thanks, appreciate them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Miss Wheeler OC Council. The um I do have paper copies of my staff report for the same time. So we are being asked to vote to waive the permit fee structure for 21, 31, 2021 for commercial street program delays short term temporary especially the street closures reedit and except the 20th September 2020 status report on'",
        "'speaker_0': 'transportation. It also adopt resolution authorizing the city manager to apply for and receive up to $75,000 for a city of rapid response bicycle pedestrian grant programs. So that all in one motion. Can't we, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, you may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do I have anyone willing to make that motion? Some. Every day I hesitate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So move.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Do we have a second? Okay. Who is first with that phrase? Mayor. This mayor next.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know who was first. But I'm happy to do it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I got you in the corner my first. So did you. All right. So it's been moved by Councilmember De so seconded by Vice Mayor Knox White. Any further discussion? And I, too, want to thank staff. You are doing an amazing job.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I will just quick little anecdote. My daughter is visiting from out of the country right now and she hasn't been home for two years. And she is just amazed. We went on the course on the trail and she loves the streets.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, yes, keep up the good work. All right. May we ever recover.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From our day thug?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Next light. Hi, Odie.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Bella.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I may.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or as the Ashcraft high net carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you so much, Staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Appreciate it. Keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What we'll do is we'll try to also improve our communications through off agenda reports, 515 reports, which I've let drop. So I'll I'll be bringing those back. But I think that would be I would just communication. I totally agree.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like communication's the biggest challenge with everybody being remote and everything going on. So. But we can certainly keep you a little bit more in the loop as things change because they're changing every day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right? Absolutely. And I think we all share your challenges with communications. We're we're fighting those battles, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would also second that we have a fantastic transportation staff, both in public works and transportation planning. We're very lucky. So thank you for all the kind words.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you all. Good night, everybody. All right. Okay, Council. Lots of good work tonight. Let's move on to item seven is city manager communications. Mr. Leavitt, just ten mute now that you got the lights back on?'"
