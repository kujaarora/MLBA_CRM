        "'speaker_4': 'Project to be located on the bottle parcel, which is a date adjacent to the College of Appleby on Fifth Street. The project will be constructed using modular units due to the compressed construction timeline required by Homekey. This will be a low barrier housing project, meaning that the requirements to qualify for a unit will be minimal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The rules must be adhered to in order to reside in the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To be clear, transitional supportive.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'It gets its name from the unique shape and size of the parcel. And as you can see, it will have to be a little creative for the project on this, but we have some great ideas. Next slide. This indicates the site, the general site, the one that we've currently come up with for this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It'll include 46 units that could accommodate up to 60 occupants with couples in some rooms. There will be parking onsite. There will be some common spaces, both indoor and outdoor. There will be a pet area. So administrative offices and storage for the residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next slide. The design that we have come up with was influenced by information gathering while preparing the road home, the recently adopted homeless strategic plan. The slide that you have in front of you shows survey results gathered during that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And next slide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also gathered information from our own site. This is for other housing projects in the Bay Area. And through that research, we compiled what we thought were really important elements of this project. Private rooms with bathrooms, for instance, pets are permitted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The project in the pet area is provided. Partners can share rooms and residents can bring and store personal belongings. Our primary goal was a very dignified opportunity for transitional housing for our homeless population.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This shows you an example of what a room may look like. This isn't exactly what it will be, but it gives you a sense. Next slide. This shows a project rendering of approximately what we anticipate this two story project to look like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Next slide. If this Homekey application is successful, you just want to note that the new development department mediated additional the manager level staff member, particularly of both an emergency housing program and his conditional housing program or lodge. One staff member would would probably support grant for compliance related administration and technical tasks, while the other staff member could'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be more of a hands on outreach focused person who could be a role material part of the continuum of care team. But to be clear, we're not asking for you to authorize this additional staff member tonight. We're just mentioning this as a future possibility.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'This summarizes our recommendations with respect to moving forward with a homekey application.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're asking tonight that city council approve.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The MCU between the city and the successor agency who owns the battle, parcel and Dignity moves in five PS or partners. We hope that you will adopt two resolutions authorizing the city and the successor agency to apply for Homekey funds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wanted to note that the author authorizing resolution say that the cities are requesting a maximum of 25 million in Homekey funds. Please note that this number is actually double what we estimate to be needed for the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, the state advises in the Homekey instructions that the grant request should be doubled to avoid needing to return to City Council and request authorization for additional funds in the future. A timeline related to this project just really wouldn't allow for that additional returning to the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our final request is to adopt a resolution to appropriate approximately $4.6 million in ARPA American Rescue Plan Act funds and a reserve approximately 1.2 million general funds for operation of the project for five years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, according to home Q&A.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Elizabeth Funke and I am the founder and executive chairman of Dignity Moves. I'd like to start by thanking staff for all of their hard work. This has been an amazing planning process and we're really excited to be here and be able to be part of of of offering this suggestion to the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jenny Mims will be serving as the nonprofit developer Dignity. Muse is focused on building transitional, supportive housing communities. We recently helped Life Moves build a project in the City of Mountain View using Homekey 1.0 funds. That project was completed start to finish in six months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We used four different manufacturing partners on that project. The one that really performed exceptionally is who we are proposing to use on this project Connect Homes based out of San Bernardino. Being that they are based on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'California, we have been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Assured that they are experiencing only very nominal disruptions due to supply chain issues that are happening around the world. Dignity Mills is also working on projects in San Francisco and Santa Barbara. One note that is the beauty of modular is that we can work with very odd shaped parcels such as the bottle parcel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have assembled a world class.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Team of development partners that includes Gensler, one of the leading architectural firms in the world, Pai and Winterton, which is a union GC that we are proposing to bring on to this project. All of them have experience working with us on multiple projects in the past and current projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Sharon Light Dignity is executive director and I are available to answer any questions. But I'd now like to turn it over to Steve Goodes, the President and CEO of Five Keys, whose organization will be with the property manager, as well as providing the wraparound services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Steve, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Elizabeth. And good evening, everyone. I'd like to say first that this is a project that is very important to me and very near and dear to my heart as a second generation. Alameda And where my kids grew up and went to school and Central High School and as one of the co-founders of the little known'",
        "'speaker_3': 'gym, the Alameda Baseball Club, where we have monthly games at Washington Park. And this is super important to me. Five keys. A little bit of history. We have 19 years experience in working with disenfranchized populations. We were founded by the sheriff of San Francisco and attorney Sidney Schwartz.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our main areas of focus are in education, primarily working in the county jails and all of the Bay Area counties. We also work in many locations as part of nonprofits, as well as working in the areas of workforce development, reentry and housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We currently operate nine housing programs for unsheltered individuals, including shelter in place, hotels, navigation centers, traditional homeless shelters, and a reentry program for women on Treasure Island.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is time for the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So Council, we can vote to give Mr. Goode a little more time to convey this important Information Council member Harry Spencer. Is that possibly the motion you're making?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm happy to move to give him an extra. And 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': '5 minutes to do it right, Mr. Good.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Five.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five keys. Five more minutes. Okay. And it's been seconded by Councilor Knox White. May we have a quick roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sorry, Jack.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Career Center. I knocked right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bella. I agree.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Please continue, Mr. Good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I appreciate that. I just want to have 2 minutes. I will try not to speed talk at this point. So as I was saying, one of the things that's most important to us running a housing program is focusing on safety, security and cleanliness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the things that we want to bring to this project is the experience that we had working in San Francisco with the Embarcadero Navigation Center. Some of you may have heard we had national attention as the controversial of bringing a shelter to the waterfront property in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At this center, there are several things we've done that we'd like to bring to Alameda. First, we'd like to involve the community. We'd like to start a community engagement process that not only involves sheltered individuals, that also involves residents surrounding businesses, other supportive nonprofits and city leaders.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The idea is to form a health advisory committee to convene on a monthly basis to talk about what's working and what isn't, and to address the problems proactively and effectively and to hear what people are saying. We also want to, as we've done in San Francisco, is develop a 24 hour hotline where we respond to calls, texts'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and emails within an immediate period of time to address any nuisances that are happening as a result of our operations in the immediate surrounding areas of the housing. This is critically important, and we found this to be a major component of our success in San Francisco, whereas we're calling the city calling 911311 or other hotlines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sometimes the responses where we can respond immediately to something in the area, whether it be garbage. Trash. Loitering, any of those things. The second thing that we like to do is what we've done in San Francisco is provide sanctuaries where in San Francisco we provide three times a day a cleaning crew, and there's a sweep of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'immediate area to make sure that there's no trash, needles or any of the other things that come along with unhoused and shelter populations, that is, to keep it clean, but not only to pick up that trash, but any other trash, because our sincere goal is to be the best community partner we can be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have 24 hour staff there. We provide our own safety, security and custodial. The reason we provide our own safety as we learn in San Francisco, nobody cares about our guests like we do. We can hire an outside security firm if, frankly, they're only there for the time that they're paid, whereas we actually train our individuals, cross-train'",
        "'speaker_3': 'with the same person it might be doing as working as an ambassador for the for the site, but also to gain security. The person in charge of guest services can also be doing security. This helps de-escalate issues because we genuinely care about the folks that we work with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the San Francisco project. We had major opposition to the opening of the program two years ago at a renewal on October 26 at the Port of San Francisco hearing. Not only that, we had zero opposition to the renewal of the contract.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had members of the community that live in the high rise building right above us speak in support of the program because they said that A and according to city reports, we had a 90 reduction in homelessness. I understand the numbers are different in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was over a 60% drop in crime in the area and the reports with the area had never looked so clean. These are the things that we want to bring up this project in Alameda. In addition to those things, we also want to provide traditional services, leveraging our existing partner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've had an existing partnership with Firebrand Breakthrough Bakery. We already established that. We'll continue to leverage that partnership. We have an existing partnership with College of Alameda, which we also want to continue to leverage that. As I mentioned, five keys is known for its safe, welcoming and compassionate, compassionate, effectively and efficiently run run facilities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our emphasis is truly on trauma informed care. In Guest Center, we treat people that see with us as guests, not as clients. And that is central. In fact, we had a paradigm shift in San Francisco where now the entire San Francisco community considers those unsheltered living in either shelter, navigation center or hotel as guests.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a product of five keys earlier where we're now we've been at the Oakdale Hotel near the airport for several years now, and that was because Alameda intentionally recruited us to come across the bay because they saw how well we ran our programs in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in fact, the medical programs that operate in Alameda County have said in five cases, one of their best providers, and they've asked us to partner with them to bring this model across the state. Lastly, the things that we'll be doing is Housing First is our priority, trying to get folks from interim housing into permanent housing first'",
        "'speaker_3': ', focusing on trauma informed care case management, enrolling folks in essential services as cal fresh medical services, legal services, dental services, and, of course, pet care. I'm happy to answer answer any questions I can for you. And like I said, with so many commitments in Alameda, this is probably the most important project we've done as long as I've'",
        "'speaker_3': 'been with.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. You've got your 5 minutes used up there, but lots of good information imparted counsel. I mean, I imagine we have some public figures or do we.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. But let's take any clarifying questions from counsel and then we'll come back for full discussion and and decision. Councilmember Harris. That's right. I saw your hand.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor, and I appreciate the presentations. My question my first question goes to the population that will be served. Will it be all Alameda unhoused?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm happy to begin that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Miss Next. Miss Maxwell, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And America, we will attempt to give it our limited preference, but we will be having county fair. We will be potentially taking some county funds. So we'll need to go to the continue the day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Continuum of care, correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. So you want to explain a little bit about what that means?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. So we will need.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually is a coordinated entry. Sorry, I got my CS mixed up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As it I fell right into the coordinated entry system. So it's a county system where each of the individuals needs to be registered and once they do, then they're put in, they're prioritized depending on needs, whether they're medical aides, different vulnerabilities, and then they're prioritized in terms of housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there is a possibility that we would receive folks from outside of our city better within Alameda County that arise up in the continuum. Their priority list.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is. Sir, if I may.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Mr.. Good Yes, you may.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was on a conversation today with Carrie Abbott, who is the Alameda County director of services, and simply asked this question of her, which she responded that we absolutely can prioritize. Alameda and those living in the city of Alameda would be the first priority if this was permanent supportive housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would not be possible because this is interim housing. They absolutely will, which has been the standing practice in Alameda to prioritize those in the immediate city. If there are not enough eligible participants to be in this program, and only then would they look outside of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that was directly from Carrie Abbott this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for pointing that out. I was going to ask, Miss Maxwell attends these working group meetings, homelessness working group meetings with me with the Alameda County Mayor's Conference. And I there are some work as well, not even work arounds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's different kinds of housings but yeah. Councilmember Spencer continue this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So yeah we have unhoused around our city multiple encampments. Would there be outreach to make sure that all of those people that are unsheltered would be would they all be eligible to be on this continuum of care.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And would there be outreach to make.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure that they are on it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. We would definitely be reaching out to our community and has community members and off and trying to help them move into this housing opportunity. You know, assuming like I said, it's a low barrier. So there's a minimal qualifications with the exception of maybe being a registered sex offender.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But otherwise, yes, we would really try to get those folks off the streets and into this housing option.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anything Mr. Good wants to add to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Only I'd say that I absolutely agree. We work with the continuum of care system. We work as a coordinated entry system. And we would do everything we possibly could to fulfill our obligation to sit in and address those encampments and sheltered individuals, including working with the other nonprofits and city agencies that are working with this population.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So based on your experience, what have you seen? Because is it a certain percentage that agrees to be on this list to be housed or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So there's, you know, there's an earlier slide it talk about why people don't want to be in a shelter and we helped in the same situation existed in San Francisco and honestly we help debunk the reasons why people wanted to be in a shelter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you provide a place, it's clean or it's welcoming where people are treated as guests, not as numbers. And safety is paramount. You can actually see what's going to happen. It's going to fuel the streets. This is also unique in that people get what they want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They get their own individual space as opposed to living in a dorm. So this is an incredible win, especially with the opportunity for funding. Right now, we see a great opportunity. We could see a significant difference immediately working with the county and getting folks into from off the streets to shelter to interim housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I appreciate you just brought up funding because if I'm reading this correctly, there's not sufficient funds that we would have to encourage our general funds for money at least in year five. But then, if I'm understanding it correctly, it's a 15 to 20 year contract.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the language used within the staff report was that the city would be the quote unquote backstop for those future years. Is there an estimate of what the backstop amount would be per year for the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I think that's for you, Ms.. Maxwell. And also, if there are any other sources besides general fund we might be looking at in future years, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Mayor. Councilmember Spencer. Yes, we currently do not have those funds identified after year five. That is a requirement to submit the application. And once that application is in, it would be important for us to begin pursuing other grant opportunities and other funding sources that I can't tell you today that we have those identified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hope that there will be featured funding opportunities available that we can take advantage of, and we'll be diligent in our efforts to pursue those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Anything from other council members? Oh, I'm sorry. Councilor Spencer, back to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, thank you. But is there an estimate of the annual operating budget for this and years after five through 15 or five through 20? An annual operating budget would be the maximum amount that the city would be asked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You are forced to backstop, is my understanding. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. Good. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but about 1.5 a year is our current estimate, is that you confirm that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct. And we've already applied for some state grant funding. We have another one in the pipeline that we've been working with Lisa and Lois on our part of our models to continue to partner with the city to identify other grant sources that honestly, it's a commitment to get people off the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's ultimately cheaper to pay for it now than in the long run with other services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Anything further, Councilmember Harry Spencer. Okay. Any other clarifying questions from other council members? Okay, Singh, then. Thank you for all the good information, everyone. Don't go anywhere. We're going to go to our public comments. Madam Clerk, how many do we have?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have eight speakers so they can get 2 minutes each. Great. The first speaker is actually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Good evening, Speaker Boling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi there. Thank you, Councilor. Yeah, I just wanted to speak in support of this project. I think this is a really good project. I think Alameda needs us. It's kind of a weird site, the bottom parcel. And it's one that's hard to develop for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think this is a great use of this. These Project HOMEKEY grants, they have these weird timelines to them. And I think it makes sense to look at something like modular construction and just having a program like this in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think it's vitally important. It's also something that's necessary for Alameda if we want to help the homeless crisis. But then also we get to count these units for our Rena, who's an upcoming item for for low income and very low income.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had a chance to meet with some people at Dignity News. I think they're doing great work. I think they've done great work in the past and I'm highly, highly bullish on this project. So I just wanted to voice my support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At Stephen Chopra.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Chopra.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. I'm in favor of this project as well. I live here in Alameda and have my law office on Redwood Square. So we have homeless people there. And I don't know, it's tough to see how miserable people out unhoused are and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to see this kind of thing go in so that we can move people into housing away from the business district. So I'm in favor of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Shagaya.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker care.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mayor. Members of council. Yes. I'm super psyched about this project. I've driven past that castle many times and thought.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Why is this empty land here? Why? Why is there not something here we live in? Like what? One of the most.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Valuable pieces of land in the country, if not the world. Like there shouldn't be this weird, vacant land when it could. Like, people could be housed there, like it could be some higher use.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And now, finally, after living in Alameda for like eight years, we have figured out what we going to put on that.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. Members of city.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Whereas Pro Housing Nonprofit is trying to help solve our housing shortage, our housing crisis by building homes at all levels of affordability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So I think, I think, you know, in this case.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It goes without saying that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, home key funding.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The opportunity to build projects like this is a moral imperative for those of us in the Bay Area. I recognize that we deal with so many different crises every day that it is hard to recognize them all as such sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But you know the opportunity. There is no single project that can build all of the housing we need for our homeless neighbors. And so we should be moving them forward as quickly as possible. This is this is urgent, urgent stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think that's lost on anyone here for sure. I would say that, you know, this project is is a pretty special one and it's doing a lot of things right. One using modular construction. That's delivering more housing better, cheaper.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's utilizing, you know, strong innovation. That's a huge plus. I'd also say there is. Almost every member of this team is is a proven.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Smith.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the Council. I've been interested in tracking housing in Alameda since the 1990s, and this is one of the highlights of this time. So it absolutely takes what's needed a housing first approach to homeless.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as Steve Goode said, with wraparound services, it will really reduce the amount of money spent on each one of the people that's moved into it. We need to do more. So this is a this is really an encouraging thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But not only that, it also will point the way to another thing that we're going to have to deal with increasingly over the. I've been working in housing for over three decades now in Alameda, over three decades. And within three decades, we're going to have to deal with a lot of problems from sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it doesn't make it may not make sense to invest in permanent housing that'll be flooded at some point. So modular housing, which can get a return on investment in 20 or 25 years or move it somewhere else will be a really good investment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is the first chance to stick our toe in that little, but that little bit of our future too. So all round, very innovative project and my congratulations to every one of the staff and everybody working on it.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you. I want to say thank you to Seattle. And first of all, it's a struggle being homeless there and. Saddens me to say. That people don't have to take the time out to understand that we are one Alameda now east alameda or West Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We are what Allan needed and. I speak for all the people when I meet him as an islander. We thank the mayor and the staff of the city and people like the Village Love and all the nonprofits do to help reach their hand out to help us and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With the best police force the in the state of California, we will survive. And I know. I know I need to be on that list. I've been on staff a year and nine months sleeping over, telling at East Asian.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I haven't actually voted for a dollar. But you never know. I was homeless. I take good care of myself. I live by it. I work at all day. And I met the mayor, the vice mayor. He told me he's not sleeping in a hotel room about two months ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He seen me cleaning. And just lost contact. Everybody's busy here by chance, they say. But I love everybody from the city. I love L.A. more. And. I just love my snow. Just plain. I love the high school of the St Joe's the Polish.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's one aluminum in my heart and I am deeply affected by the homeless. And the no one is really supporting me as much as the boys love it. A couple of people just see City Hall and I'm thankful and grateful for that because I'm still to die of nights and promises are being broken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's like they're picking who lives and who dies. My brother's sickle cell anemia animal came from my brother's sickle cell anemia. Younger brother will take my blood, my plasma. I want to take one aluminum for life. I love everybody.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Altieri.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, City Council. Thank you for your time tonight. I just wanted Josh, let's hear from the housing authority, the city of Alameda and just wanted to update the council on some of the affordable housing solutions and projects that we're bringing to the city of Alameda with emergency housing vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We got 57 emergency housing vouchers in May of 2021.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just just for clarification. Mr. Altieri, always lovely to see you and hear you. You are speaking on this particular bottle, parcel item of transitional housing. Okay. Yeah, I was thinking. Yeah, let's bring you back. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Sit tight. Okay. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In a bag.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just and a bag just. Good evening. Welcome. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Everyone. Good evening, mayor. You in city council members and events. As you all know, up until five months ago, I was the coordinator of homelessness services for the City of Alameda, a position that I was very proud of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I really was honored to to be a part of the city during that time. We created many programs through partnerships with community based organizations, Village of Love, Building Futures, Operation Dignity, Saint Vincent de Paul, the food bank, dine and connect.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Many others that I'm forgetting. And during you know all that, I was very, very proud of the work that we did and we did some fantastic work, but they're not housing. And I often felt that my day was like Groundhog Day, both doing the same thing, you know, that it's not really resolving the issue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Housing is really the solution, and I support this project wholeheartedly and I'm so glad to hear that it's really moving in the city of Alameda. And I couldn't be more proud of being an Alameda resident and a homeowner here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for your support of this project and please keep up the good work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you so much. And as well as for the wonderful foundation that you laid for us in providing homeless services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We are grateful to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is our last speaker, Denise Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I also just wanted to support this this item strongly, emphatically. And the only thing I wanted to add is that, you know, there's a lot of emphasis of focusing on Alabamans, which I you know, I'm. I get prioritizing people who live here or have been here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But if we have the ability to help people from outside of Alameda, I absolutely think that we should do that. And I, I just want to I just wanted to add that, you know, that should be something that we also prioritize if we are able to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I support this wholeheartedly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. So with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have one more speaker.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With that, we will not go. Yeah, that's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hello, Katrina.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Katrina.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I wanted to call and also voiced my support wholeheartedly for this initiative. I think housing is a human right and as the cost of living continues to skyrocket in the Bay Area. Alameda absolutely needs to do something to support folks who are unhoused and give them a safe space where they can take care of themselves'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And so I wholeheartedly support this, and I thank you all for putting so much time and effort into this proposal. And I'm excited to see, see, get moving. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Any further speakers, madam? Click. Going where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Going to rise. Okay. With that, we are going to close public comment on item three of the successor agency special meeting. We are going to go back to council, so I guess Councilor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I just had a follow up question from one of the speakers. Do these units count towards our arena goals? Can someone confirm that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A mismatch.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I tried to run that down today with Mr. Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Our planning director, and he is not positive that they would, but he will advocate for them to be. So apparently there is some conversation going on at the state level to make that determination. So I can't definitively answer, but we will certainly attempt for that to happen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will add that that was the first time I heard of that, and I was pretty, pretty dialed in to things going on at the state level. I don't doubt that it might be being discussed. I doubt that would be new.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but it provides a lot of other important services and functions. So I want to thank all the staff before I go to council comments and a representative. Ms.. Funk I think I got to meet you right when we visited.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm always dragging staff on field trips. I'll go. I think they took me on this one. But we did visit the The Mountain View site of that dignity moves stood up and and five keys operates and you know things believing not only seeing but getting to talk to residents, being invited inside to see their homes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so anyway, I've just welcomed the council to make your comments, ask your questions. We have heard that there is a fast timeline on this to get all these funds and it's just, you know, a lot of balls up in the air.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So let's let's see what we can do. And I'm thrilled that we're we're considering this tonight. I'd like to read Councilor Harry Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I do appreciate the presentations and the work that's gone into this. I want to thank all of you. So one point that I had raised was, how are we going to pay for this? And in regards to the comments of why our meetings, my understanding is that this will use general fund moneys and that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the last time I saw a five year forecast for our city, we actually start going negative pretty soon or very close to it. And I would like to ask, in regards to our staff, how do you anticipate being able to pay for the additional it sounds like at most 1.5 million and moving forward year after year at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'most. And I appreciate that, Mike, but obviously recently we were asked about doing a bond. And on today's agenda, we do have other checks possible going to the taxpayers again to try to bring in more money to pay all of our current expense expenditures that we're already committed to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would like to get more information about what is the best plan to be able to pay for this. But will the staff be asking us to cut somewhere to make money available, or is it going to be that we need to pass a tax to be able to pay for all of the things we've already'",
        "'speaker_2': 'committed to? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So who would like to in addition to the grant funding that I heard that we would be applying for, and in fact, that five keys will assist us in applying for? Ms.. Maxwell. Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Bowden. Who I want to hop on that one, please.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We you know, we with the assistance of the city manager and assistant city manager, we could have conversations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About an.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Affordable housing bond. That's something we've lightly discussed. So that's a possibility. Like I mentioned, grant funds, general fund, private funding sources these committees will be pursuing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Kelso, I'm her Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So if I heard correctly, then I think we're all in agreement, then, that we actually need new moneys to be able to meet these expenditures moving forward. But we currently do not have sufficient funds within our budget. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city managers and Myriad I think he wants to add something. Mr..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'LEVITT So so in addition to what Lisa said, we also the issue that you talking about for the future, where we were showing future deficits, a lot of that has to do with increases in the pension costs. So we have been concentrating on ways to try to level out those future pension costs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And housing and homelessness are two priorities in the city council or have been priorities of the city council. And so we are looking for ways that the general fund can assist in some level with that, but would complement grant fine funding and other type of funding, such as what we're doing right now with the ARPA and with'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the application that we're putting in with the state.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So personally, I do have concerns about the money moving forward. I don't think it's appropriate for us to continually go back to our community members and ask them for more money in regards to taxes and bonds and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we, at least from my perspective, it is very important for us to acknowledge that we cannot continue to pay for everything that ends up in front of us. And. And. And now this project. So for me, it's very important that it, in fact be for our meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would actually request that there be updates as it comes back to us. Maybe I would think yearly where we would be able to see who is in fact being housed there because we currently we are not a big city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We all know that we're less than 100,000. We have limited funds. We do not have access to funds that some larger cities do, and we currently do. In fact, and I appreciate this, we have the expenses of trying to help our unhoused currently.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I don't think our city is in a position to house the counties or the state's unhoused as much as I would like to, because we really are already going the wrong direction and we have to pay for so many things.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am in fact willing to support this project because and I will say this I think our team that presented tonight is stellar. I really appreciated all of your comments. I trust that you're going to do our utmost to, in fact, help us get the grant funding as much as possible to help in those later years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it is actually a really good location in regards to proximity to services. The college is right there, I think I hope to be able to we know that we also have unhoused college students. And I don't know if there's a way to work with the college more, but to also take advantage of the courses'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that are offered there so that we don't have to duplicate, you know, services that can be provided. The college offers a lot of stuff, including to our veterans. And you are I will trust that you all do our utmost to connect the dots, to make other services, to help these people take advantage of other services that are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'there and within our community. And we do have a very compassionate community. And but, you know, you have the the public transportation. I think that's a great location there. And I do appreciate the comments in regards to security and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But actually, when my one of my concerns that I would just be aware of is the surrounding community as students, young adults, and trying to respect the students and the colleges and all of that and helping us all work together and build those relationships to have mutual respect for each other moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I do plan to support it. I truly hope that we'll be able to deal with the grants and whatnot. I more than likely will not support any tax efforts to our citizens because sadly, I feel like many of us are being pushed out of Alameda as it is and it all adds up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I do think this is a worthy cause. But I do want to underscore how impressive I think this team is and your presentations tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember her Spencer Vice Mayor Vella, I think I see your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks about a mayor and thank you to staff for the presentation. And thank you for all of the all of the hard work that has gone into kind of getting all the pieces together. I think a few things, but know housing and lack of housing is really a problem and a social issue for all of us, regardless'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of where in the county or out of the county you live. I think that when we think about this problem and we think about the number of people who do not have housing, we are creating situations where the cost continues to escalate because we are all paying the price when people need social services and assistance on the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'back end. We are all paying the price when somebody needs transport or paramedic assistance because we frankly did not provide routine and basic provide for routine and basic human necessity, the first of which are the first and foremost of which is shelter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I say this in the comfort of my own home. Many of us are calling in to this meeting. We have a place to call our own, whether we own it or we're renting it. But we have a roof over our heads.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think when when we're thinking about all of the things that people are facing and there was a comment about making sure that we're not interfering with the College of Alameda and the students there. I teach at Mills College, and I can tell you right now that many of my students faced housing insecurity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was one of the top issues for my students. It impacted their emotional well-being, their mental health, all all aspects of of learning. We know that having housing insecurity creates adverse impacts in so many different ways, and we end up paying the price as a society.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the price tag is extremely high. We know that we've seen the cost of waiting until things are so bad that it's an emergency situation. So I think this is a step in the right direction. I want to see more of this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that there will be plenty of conversation at the state level about whether or not this counts towards our housing element. But regardless of what this does, this is the right thing to do. This is something that we should find funding for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, there are lots of grants out there. But I also think that we're talking about a de minimis amount of the overall city budget in order to see this project through, if that's what it comes down to. And frankly, I think this is something we can talk about compassion all we want.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to see compassion through action. That is really where I think we can make the biggest difference. And we had a speaker earlier saying that we are one Alameda and we really are we're one Alameda, also one part of a larger county.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we depend on the network of county services collectively and collaboratively in order to see the overall social welfare of our community. So I think we need to do our part for that. I appreciate the fact that our staff and our city is able to move and act fairly quickly once we've identified a problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's what I'm really proud of tonight, is that this is before us and that we are taking action and really seeing it come to fruition and that we don't have to sit around and wait. So I'm excited to support this and support whatever we need to do to see this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The famous and mute button. Thank you, Vice Mayor Vela. Councilmember DeSantis, I see your hand go up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, great. Well, I think we really need to seize this rare opportunity to do something bold. And I think in this 46 unit modular project, we could potentially put 46 to 60 individuals back on to a path of stability and in doing so, make a significant cut into our overall homeless population numbers of roughly 230 to 250'",
        "'speaker_4': '. In the fact that, you know, Washington, D.C. through ARPA funds is a is providing a lot of the backup money is great but you know with wise eyes wide open certainly if the city of Alameda has to step up after five after five years of this project, then I have no doubt that our city staff will be'",
        "'speaker_4': 'creative enough in terms of finding the money to maintain the operations of this after year five. So this is a rare opportunity that we have to seize. And I think what makes this kind of exciting is the fact that by virtue of its modular characteristics, it seems like it's something that can be implemented relatively quickly so that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'residents of Alameda will begin to see the fruits of this great decision when they go shopping at Alameda landing or when they're driving through that area in the West End. So I just want to lend my support to this project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think this is going to be a great thing for the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai, Councilmember Knox, would you go next?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I will join my colleagues in ensuring my appreciation for all the good work that went into this and excitement to vote for this. For me, I as we are not approving a specific plan. I did want to just make sure that we give some direction to staff that while there is a potential example project of'",
        "'speaker_3': '46, that we really ask staff to work with dignity and the providers to ensure that the parking that that we maximize the housing based on the experience of dignity while providing the housing that we know we also. All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, the parking that we also know is needed to run a successful program. I know that dignity with their experience has that experience to help us really guide that decision as to what those right numbers are. But for me, I'd like to if we can get to 48 or 49 units on this same parcel, I think that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that just extends our our ability to provide this the services and and the support that that we want. My other request would simply be that even as we're starting the discussions around this MRU, that the partners that are moving forward begin engaging with them at the homes in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I know that there is a lot of concern and and questions that are coming up. And I think the earlier we are out there talking to them about what's going on in developing good neighbor agreements, etc., the better that we will or the more successful will be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I look forward to supporting this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilor. And that's what I will go next. And last I guess so, you know. Shortly after, our city manager, Eric Levitt, came and now it's been going on three years, Mr. Levitt. I took him and Anabaptist.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We went out on a field trip to see a navigation center at Berkeley, and it was really impressive. And then I started learning about other things that were being done in other cities and stuff. And I took a field trip to San Jose and saw some pretty impressive things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then we visited Mountain View and we just came away saying, Wow, it is possible and it's within our it's really is within our grasp. And as has been noted, this is modular housing. It can be stood up quickly, and I'm pretty sure I'm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ms. five. Mr.. Good You can confirm that the Mountain View Project is actually more housing units than what we're talking about. Right. And it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And because it even has like one wing was for adults, individual and couples and then separated by that nice common area. And on the other wing it was for families. They put it up in six months. So that's that's really promising and encouraging.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so yes to Councilmember Dave Suggs comment, we do have these ARPA funds, these you know, this is really great cities. I'll tell you, we worked really hard to advocate for direct funding from ARPA because normally everything goes through the state, everything goes through the county.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we just well, I won't get dramatic, but it's really exciting to have direct allocation to cities. But it was always specified that this is one time money, so you don't use it for operating budgets for ongoing expenses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that's why there's this combination. But at the same time, we have these funds coming in from from the state, these it's cheap, right? That they are roomkey and homekey. So we're just taking advantage of all of those.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And this is a wonderful opportunity to the concern with the general fund expenditures downstream. If it comes to that, maybe it does, but maybe we keep cobbling grant funding together. We're going to pay one way or the other.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We pay. There's a cost to people sleeping in businesses, doorways and and helping people who, you know, have no place to go. This is a way that we can help people with dignity. And remember, it's transitional. So maybe in about a year's time, some of these folks will move on to a permanent roof over their head.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And it's as the vice mayor said, it's something that we all take for granted, most of us who've never had that kind of experience. So I'm really excited to be moving to help move this forward. I just this is a little item, but I think it'll be great.'",

They call it the doctor mobile, but it has veterinary care. And one of the things that they have done is they've been helping care for the pets of our homeless individuals.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'However, I'd like to reiterate and elaborate on some of the points I made. First of all, as the project currently stands, this is not scattered off site housing. This is clustered housing. Alameda Point is a community with mixed housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have more than 200 units of permanent supportive housing that is wonderfully managed by the Army two point Collaborative. We have a domestic violence shelter. We have transitional housing trailers, and we have traditional family housing. And in this mix of housing, the we have seen really good outcomes from other residents who need support.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The two point neighborhood, however, has become disproportionately burdened by the housing policies of the city. It seems like whenever we have a need for housing, the first the first stop is Alameda point. And I'm sorry. Let me that's okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The newly formed unhoused encampment over as they have formed over on the estuary has increased foot traffic through the neighborhood. We are taking housing out of the rental inventory at this point. And. Excuse me. I'm sorry. So the plan is actually removing housing as it stands, as in rental, and it is not adding housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The point is largely comprised of historically disenfranchized populations, and my main concern here is that there has been no community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On this subject. And again, with a neighborhood that has been largely disenfranchized, it seems like this is the one neighborhood who has not been engaged in the process. Oftentimes when we've had other housing issues come up, other neighborhoods have been engaged.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm very concerned with the lack of involvement once again with Alameda Point residents. They have seen it. They have seen their voices and heard in a lot of different communities, in a lot of different venues. I think that that's I think the active dismantling of this community is going to further disenfranchize a lot of our residents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'here and it's going to entrench the segregation policies that are are are cropping up for this. The solution I. I'm going to ask the council to delay the vote on this until we can have some meaningful community dialog and let the voices of Alameda point to be heard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We now have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Reached the limit of being over seven speakers, so the time will now drop to 2 minutes per speaker. Okay. Next speaker is Dee Dee Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Lewis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello? Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well. Well, I want to just thank you all for all the hard work you are doing. Providing housing. Housing and dignity, I think, are both human rights. And there is no clear cut path to making that a reality for everyone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also live on a block of Pearl Harbor, right near one of what we call the big whites that I am reading. What house? 11 kind of a rotating residency of 11 tenants going through various programs to kind of get their get themselves together and be able to find permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And 11 or a single family home just seems like a lot. If we've learned anything from MTV's The Real World. Even seven strangers living in a house was a whole lot of problems. And 11 just feels like we are not necessarily setting these residents up for success.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would love to see housing insecure families come into this neighborhood. I know through some of my work with AUC, we do have plenty of families that that would be a great fit here. I also was very excited to hear about the bottle parcel and some of that work and I'm hoping we can have some of that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'continue maybe on Bay Farm as well and kind of share it in this one. I you know, I was hearing a lot of like we're one island, we're one Alameda. And, you know, it's great that we have a lot of those services in our neighborhood, but I think it would be nice to not have all of them'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in our neighborhood. And I will see the rest of my time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ake you speaker Lewis our next speaker. And by the way, we don't see time. Everybody gets 2 minutes and you use it or not. But thank you. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Amy Benjamin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker. Benjamin.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. I too am a resident of Alameda Point, a block away from one of the proposed sites. One of the great things about our neighborhood is that it is a very family oriented neighborhood and it is also affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One of the reasons that we did move here with our three children was so that we would be able it was one of the only places that we could afford to live. But it's also a childhood that they have out here, much like the eighties, where they can ride around on their bikes and they're barefoot, running from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'house to house and day and night. And I don't worry about it at all. However, I feel like if we have 11 to 13 people in a single family home directly across the street with a rotating. I don't know with rotating people coming in if they're going to be changing it up every six months because it's emergency'",
        "'speaker_2': 'housing. It's not permanent housing. These aren't people that are going to be endeared to our community or part of our community per say, because they're not going to be investing in it. I don't feel like I would have that same sense of safety.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't feel like I would have that same sense of well-being. Having my children just out playing feral and free range. I think that if we had family housing here, that it would be more than welcome refugee housing more than welcome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But to have just people that are coming in for like a moment isn't really necessarily something that feels like it's in line with our community that we have here. And we do have a very strong community, as you can see from the letters that have been pouring in all day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also would like to say just on a similar note, that the bottle parcel tax is very well thought out. I mean, having Gensler on board, having all of the things put together, having people from that staff here to talk to us was really reassuring and lovely that this doesn't feel like it's as put together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I would also like to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have the vote delayed en masse until there can be more discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Speaker Benjamin. Okay. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Craig Mia.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is Mr. Myatt, right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct, Mr. Myers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Your council members and mayor. I wanted to say I'm. Redevelopment is near and dear to my heart. I'm a real estate developer and advisor. I was responsible, started revitalizing downtown San Jose, downtown L.A., Albuquerque, and also responsible architecture of the and airport commercial properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I started development groups of marketing companies, and I've also gone about 100 years of single family housing throughout the Central Valley. I'm also on the board of the East Bay Overland Institute, and I'm also just been nominated as one to the state of Indiana for Project Infant Family Services as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I really care about each other and I'm also rivers and it wouldn't be much. Unfortunately, I can't support this venture because it is not fitting with the historical charter. This particular district is called a historical district and the city actually picked a color scheme so that when we change the legacy for this particular historical area and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'this area was issued for single families and should be preserved because of the policy. Number two, I don't like about this a stream segregation of services. The point I wanted to see that the transit ought to be dispersed around the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd like to see a study done on geospatial mapping illustrating the number of units and location roughly on the Alameda. Third thing I dislike was like a lack of transparency. I just found about this yesterday. And this was like there was no public comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's no noticing in the residence. We have no idea who's actually managing the facilities or what's actually happening. I've moved in here because as a fan community, I have a daughter. I like to have my daughter play with neighbors, which should be all the families and kids not loving adults and also living in the big white 11'",
        "'speaker_3': 'people is not really nice. I've had family members over and love and time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Your time is up. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'William Smith.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Smith.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the Council. As I mentioned earlier, I've been involved for over three decades with housing in Alameda, and I've really watched how it's become an issue. We could predict predicted, but now that the predictions have come true and regarding the the housing that you're talking about for this item, it's emergency housing'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It's not permanent housing. And so it's a contract for two years. So if it doesn't work out at this particular place, it can be revoked. And it's emergency housing. It's needed now. It's needed for people today. And so that means that we will have less consideration about some of the other things regarding concentration at Alameda Point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is a problem, but it's only three, three housing units. And the place where we will really get after that is coming up later on the agenda. The housing element is affirmatively furthering fair housing and that's where things based.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing opportunities are spread throughout the island and that's the place to really address that. And three units, 3 to 3 homes, one way or the other is not a major issue on for for reform, firmly furthering for housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then the other thing, what you commonly hear, we we're a family neighborhood and we only want families here. Well, that's a that's a common thing I've heard for all three decades. And we have to have places for single people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of our own kids grow up. They're not they're not married right away. They need a place to live. They need it. So we need to work in all different kinds of people and all the neighborhoods and integrate them together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm definitely would suggest you go ahead with this, but be sure your staff at absolutely the best do a high quality job because if you don't I would be supportive of the neighborhood and turn and and closing it down in two years when it comes up for renewal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker Smith, our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Dennis Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, again, I. Okay. I do agree that the island does need to share in the responsibility to help our unhoused neighbors, but not for the reasons that some previous speakers mentioned. Alameda The entirety of Alameda is a family neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I live in the East End. There's families here. There's homes here. Put it here. I don't care. But you know what? I'm hearing a lot of my neighbors on the other end of the island saying is that this, you know, offering services to unhoused people is going to bring in crime and make their kids'",
        "'speaker_2': 'unsafe. And that's not true. When people are receiving services and are receiving care, they are part of our community and they do have an investment in maintaining that community. So I'm just really disappointed to hear some of the things that I've heard from people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So but yeah, put it put it over here. I don't you know, I'd love to have some new neighbors and, you know, welcome to my community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Speaker Anderson. And I just want to remind people that you are all entitled to make whatever comments you want to make. We try not to comment or disparage what anyone else said because your your comments, that's your truth and and your perspective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we we value and learn from all of it. Further comments, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have one more speaker, Josh Guyer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Guyer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. Me being other council members, I also note I want to echo everything that Janice and Bill said. For me, this is it's a it's the emergency housing. It's in an emergency. And so we need to make accommodations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am sympathetic to people who live in an Alameda point that if it appears in their would be corrected.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thing, that appears that there's a lot of different kinds of services that are concentrated there. As Bill said, we're going to get to that and in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The next item about how to concentrate both opportunity and this amenity across the island, because that's what is required of us by affirmatively furthering fair housing. But I'm sympathetic to that. But I did want to point to one thing that I noticed at least three speakers reference and Bill running up to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The idea that there's a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Family neighborhood in that that there were there would might be people who are unlike.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Families who would be in proximity to our families. And that would be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Somehow inherently wrong. I want to just as Bill said, I want to draw attention to the fact that I mean, either either people are inherently have inherent value and they have the inherent right to dignity or they don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if and what determines that and if they do, what determines that value is not whether they're a member of a family or not. People have value.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'People deserve dignity. And there's a lot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unfortunately, there's a there's a lack of available dignity right now. And we we're trying to make it a little less lacking by providing housing here. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Speaker Guyer And I believe we might have another speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They just put their hand down. Sorry. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't have another speaker. Okay. With that, I am going to close public comment on item seven A and council. We are going to take a little break because we've already exceeded my two hour zoom rule. And so it's 942 that's come back at 955.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Quick break. Some of us will put in eye drops and look away from your screen for a little bit. 955, we'll see you back here. Thanks, everyone. Counsel, you'll want to mute and probably turn off your cameras.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You can just leave and log back in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi, John. Good to see you. I think it's best to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello? Hello.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Laura.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I understand we may have a guest.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Max is here, and I believe they will. People, evil people. Death. Excellent. So Jonathan Russell Apax has joined us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There he is. Welcome. How are you?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm doing well. How are you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Let me just check in with our city clerk. Madam Clerical studio's count. I've got one, two, three, four, five. Okay. And we've got a city manager. City manager? Hello, city attorney. We've got. Okay, man. Everybody just keeps moving around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So are we. Are you ready to go, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, we are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Welcome back, everyone. We are back from our break. And so we and we finished our public comment. We are very fortunate to have been joined by Jonathan Russell of Facts, which is Bay Area Community Services. I just want to introduce yourself, Mr. Russell, that will make him available for any council questions or counsel.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We could vote to give Mr. Russell 5 minutes to give an overview of his program. And I'm going to assume that you were listening to the previous discussion and could perhaps address some of the concerns. Councilmember Spencer, Jesse, Angela.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. I'm happy to make a motion to give him 5 minutes, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And that's the second by Councilmember Knox, who I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Perfectly had a motion, had a second, maybe. We have a quick roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rotation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or a spencer. I next like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She's there somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He is. She's there. She's just juggling. So we can we can skip the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm an I, and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we've got a majority, so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, let's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's go ahead and start. Thank you. All right, welcome, Mr. Russell. In 5 minutes, tell us everything we need to know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much, Madam Mayor. And council members. My name is Jonathan Russell. I'm the chief strategy officer for Bay Area Community Services. Just briefly, I have the five, ten, 15, 30 minute version, so I'll I'll do the five minute max is a we are a nonprofit provider rooted in Alameda County founded in 1953 in Oakland as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a group of 12 concerned churches came together and said, we want to provide for the needs of our community long before things like social services existed in any government sector form and really have evolved from that rooted, community based place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are now a large nonprofit that provides 40 plus programs across the behavioral health spectrum and homeless and housing services in seven counties. Again, most deeply rooted in Alameda County. Here as a chief strategy officer, my job is spending a lot of time on council meetings like this and also working with lovely city staff like Lois and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Lisa and Veronica to develop interventions that work and address and end homelessness. And so back as an agency, we provide a lot of homeless services. We serve over 17,000 people a year across all of our programs and housed thousands of people a year across our programs as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we are deeply deep believers in a housing first model and a harm reduction model and in a dignified, uplifting and empowering approach to our community experiencing houseless mess. So this program is unique in that it is located in a scattered site, kind of in large home setting, which Backes is also familiar with.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We operate about 300 units of scattered site housing in neighborhoods across Alameda County, single family homes, the majority of those permanent housing. But we've also operated an interim way. This interim housing program model is also a model that we've been operating since 2013.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now in eight programs that serve over 800 people a year across those programs all together. Now, now that we have eight and eight different cities, all working with local jurisdictions, all deeply committed to doing not just interim work, but housing that turns into permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we've been very fortunate to be able to have 80% on average of the folks served in these interventions, transitioned to permanent housing from interim housing, which, if you know anything about the numbers, is is pretty good. It's so we we we joke that not joke, but we make it clear we don't operate emergency shelter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's not just about the shelter and rest of it, it's about a housing pathway. So we have had we have housed over 1500 people through this intervention alone since launching these programs that have really grown since 2018. We have an interim housing program in Berkeley and Hayward and Fremont, two in Oakland just to name the Alameda County'",
        "'speaker_4': 'program. So happy to talk more, understand the community concerns. We are deep believers that it is about seeing our unhoused neighbors as part of our community. And so how can we address everyone's concerns? Work to destigmatize and work to provide the supports we know we need.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do want to just lift up one community member comment that I think is critical for all of us to realize, and the evidence bears it out. When we provide services, we don't bring problems, we alleviate them. When we provide and wraparound folks in our community, we alleviate problems for businesses, not create.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I do just want to say, you know, these these are complicated issues, but these are our neighbors and these are models that work. And I'm not just saying that because because Max is involved. I'm saying that because I just I appreciate the community's commitment to providing the services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we deeply believe that the neighborhood is the best place to do so. And so a model, though unique, that is not a big single project that's over there in this industrial park or what have you, which very often, as we all know, sometimes emergency shelters are there is there is value in doing this in a community'",
        "'speaker_4': ', in a neighborhood setting. And it's an opportunity for us to wrap around and be a part of that process of transformation and destigmatizing. So that's my that's my impromptu representation. Happy to take any questions or talk more specifically about the service model and anything else there in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Mr. Russell, you did a good job of sticking to your 5 minutes. Among the concerns we heard from residents is that some of them are just learning about this. This concept wasn't communicated to them ahead of time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can't turn the clock back. But now that we're here and assuming we have the opportunity to move forward, how will backs work with the neighbors? What is your communication model for? For neighbors? Because I think our our speakers raised some very valid concerns.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And go ahead, Lisa. Maxwell. Ms..'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Maxwell? Yes. I'd like to be a Navy admiral, please. We have scheduled a community meeting to to share ideas and get questions on the 29th of this month at 6 p.m. at the club. We have that space preserved, so we'll send out further information.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's already on the city's website. So that'll be our initial offering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And opportunity to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Engage with the community. We can certainly do that again if folks feel like another would be warranted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also understand from Mr. Russell and he can.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Elaborate on this if you'd like, that once.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Assuming that we go too far with this program, the community members would have easy access to reach.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Out to backs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If something arose that they found to their disliking and wanted to communicate a concern. So there will be a continued line of communication between the service providers and the community members.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Maybe Mr. Russell can amplify that. When when was that meeting scheduled?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's on the 29th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. But when was it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We just played it together because I wanted to have an opportunity to address concerns. Until we got through this evening, we weren't sure we had a program. So we will move forward with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So we will. Well, look forward to hearing more about that. So. Back to Mr. Russell. So Ms.. Maxwell mentioned that Access 24 seven for neighbors who have concerns or questions.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, absolutely. I think probably we again, we believe deeply that this is a community conversation. And so it needs to be a community investment, not that everyone's kicking in, you know, physical dollars do it, but value and commitment to the process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that comes through conversation. So we definitely want to make ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Available and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Ongoing. If this were to move forward and backs was the operator to ongoing concerns. We do provide 24 hour services for emergencies and for residents. I don't I don't know if I have a 24 hour line for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to talk about this thing at 3 a.m., but definitely will have an avenue in which to ask those questions and be accessible to to make available ourself both individually and in a group space, in a neighborhood meeting space to talk through these things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not sure I understand you, but if a neighbor I understand from reading the staff report that there will be someone overnight on on these properties. And I assume that someone who is staying awake and overseeing things as opposed to also being asleep.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But if a neighbor were concerned about some issue arising, some perceived serious issue arising out of one of these properties. Could they not access someone from Baxter? Who would they call? Are they call community development? Anyone can chime in here on staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I mean, we certainly will have that stuff. And so it could structure it. I'm more bit like, Hey, I want to have a meeting and talk about this and stuff like that. That is, is probably a business hours thing, but definitely we will have staff that is doing 24 hour services on site and I think certainly'",
        "'speaker_4': 'could make that available through through either reaching out directly to us as a service provider in the midnight hour or of course, if it's an emergency or a crisis or reaching.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Out to crisis response as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I defer to the city on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There will be a staff person in each house 24 hours a day. If there is an immediate emergency there, that person could address that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And awake as as bright new risk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And again, this is a concern coming from a neighbor. Is there a phone number? Is there more to be determined?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There will.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be. We can share phone numbers that will cause the that the will allow people access facts. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Emergency concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. Okay. Council members questions. Comments. Councilor SAC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I think what was very helpful was the contract that was provided. And I just want to make something clear in the contract on the services that is going to be provided. There's a section called program noncompliance protocols and a basis for a discharge from the facility includes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first bullet point is possession of weapons. The third bullet point is assault or other violent behavior. The fourth bullet point is theft. The fifth bullet point is destruction of property. So those bullet points when we're talking about a thought, assault and theft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are we talking about and the destruction of property? How are we talking about that? Does it have to be proven in a court of law? I mean, how is it going to be? And and if the assaults or thefts are against not fellow clients, but against neighbors, how how how is this taken into account?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Great question. So the the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Noncompliance protocol, again, and this is sort of a process we use across all of all of these programs that that do this intervention, that provide these services, of course, as written is relative to events internal to the program that we would then manage the investigation, which would be, you know, bringing all parties to the table in terms'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of what happened, including witnesses, including staff, including the rest. And if it was determined that there was violence or serious threat of violence, for example, as one of the things you selected, then we would develop a discharge plan in which to find another opportunity quickly and sometimes immediately, depending on the level of risk and the level of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'need for that individual. So that's kind of an internal to the program, not at the court of law, but certainly at the back senior leadership with all relevant parties giving voice to and doing that internal investigation relative to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that we would definitely want to hold the same standard relative to outside that particular home community, the broader neighborhood community. But that would, I think, the determination around if it was something like that, that would need to involve the, you know, the local authorities to the area that they are in the sense that we don't'",
        "'speaker_4': 'have purview into ourselves over over all of those issues. But we would certainly hold the same standard and the same sort of compliance standard, regardless of who it was impacting in the community in terms of the program or otherwise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hey, other questions, comments, Councilmember Spencer and then Councilmember Knox. Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. So my first question is, will this house alameda unhoused. It's that 100%. That's the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You want to explain why this max time is better?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I'd be happy to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The reason being that we are using ARPA funds and that those funds do not come with a obligation to go through the county's system or to house folks outside of the city. So our priority and our focus will be our own Alameda research.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Will there be any general fund moneys used for this? ARPA funds are being used for this. No, no, not at this point. Thank you. The community outreach. So I appreciate that. This organization, your organization has been around since 1953 and is community based.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Why has there not been any meetings with neighbors to date?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ms.. Maxwell, do you want to take that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd be happy to. Yes. We were not sure that we actually had a program to discuss with them. We wanted to make sure that we had city council buy in. And as I mentioned, we've got one scheduled for the 29th, so we can take that feedback.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my concern with that is that's after the vote. So I'm not quite sure how what the point is of reaching out to the neighbors after we have voted on this. This is not I thought we were being asked to vote to approve the program today.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are asking for that. Councilmember Smith Spencer, I apologize if I interrupted you slightly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And during our community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Meetings, my understanding would be we were going to get feedback. And if that allowed us to in any way tweak or modify our program to deal with some of the concerns we could possibly consider those options. There was some suggestion that we could work work in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So we did hear from members of the community of concerns of having 11 and they may be wrong on the numbers is that 11 people per home. That's correct. It is 10 to 11.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We spoke with two potential service providers. They both came up with the exact same number of folks that they would be interested in serving in that environment. They will configure the rooms to be shared. And although this is not considered current, this is not considered to be, you know, dorm style housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in fact, Max was permitted to continue operating a comparable program during the pandemic by the county. They do observe protocols for COVID safety, and they do space folks out in rooms. Some of the rooms in these homes are pretty large.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it will just depend on the size of the room. But they also intend to use the living room as a additional sleeping area in order to maximize so we can serve.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So my understanding is these houses have three bedrooms. Do any of them have four or five bedrooms? How many bedrooms are in these?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The two. What we refer to as the big lights each have four. And then they obviously tend to use the living room. So that provides for that. There's multiple opportunities. There would definitely be a little less amount, less people in the townhome.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It just has three bedrooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But if it's five, if it's four plus one rooms and we and you're going to house 11 people or ten people believe it's five and four. Excuse me. So is it two people per room, though, or is it sometimes three?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's from typically two, I think there could be a possible occasionally three, but I think two is going to be the preference. The living room, though, is a little larger. So the reason I'm hesitating is I think that may be or the additional person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Potentially be because they could be spaced out adequately and not in that area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Russell, is there anything you want to add?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I think that the living room could provide a space where it could actually be it's a very large space about the size of the house I live in right now. And so that could be split up into even two rooms itself.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So our goal would be to have appropriate distancing with two to a room. And if that remained, one large single space would be more spacious than some of the individual or smaller groups by having three people. So that would kind of be a let's design it out and see what the best amount of space is potentially for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the living room.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then where is the person that is the supervisor? Are they one of the 11 people?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they're not living onsite, they're working three shifts a day. And so the staff are working between and in the home. So there's additional space that goes beyond the living quarters in which both for staff to operate and to be shared space for folks in the dining room, which would be a kind of common living space and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an additional space in, in, in the rest of the home. So the onsite staff would be not in anyone's bedroom. They would be operating in the common space. And the majority of the services are community based. So our care coordinators, which are doing the case management, developing the housing plans, would be working with folks in the community'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as they plan their transitions, and that would be, of course, the services during the daytime hours.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So we also heard preferences for families, some sort of families. Do you have back? I think there was a speaker who works with the school district. Do you have accommodations for families in any of these homes?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can address that question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of Maxwell Place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, we have we heard that concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Earlier from both the community as well as the council members. And we investigated that little to the extent that we had and we and we spoke to that executive director backs to the extent that we had say three families we could potentially is one of the townhomes for families that's that's not out of the range of possibility'",
        "'speaker_4': '. However we also spoke to Operation Dignity non story building as is most familiar with our current unhoused population. And they are of the opinion that based on their experience that we don't really have a great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Number of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Truly unhoused families in Alameda. And the perspective of the school district is slightly different because the mayor can slip into laws and parameters for what constitutes homelessness for difference. That means they could potentially be house service accounts or things that they have a roof.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Over their head.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But to serve classically homeless, truly unhoused individuals, if we're looking for families that are not terribly many in Alameda, but we can leave that possibility open.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So this will be three homes with each with approximately 11 people living there as individual adults, it sounds like. And I think the three homes are within I'm going to say, I don't know. What is the distance that you think?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All three? I think it's about a half a mile. That sounds about right to me. So then I'm going to swing back to what other examples does Backes have of having three homes within a half mile of each other?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You 11 individuals each.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mr. Russell going to take that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So we operate this interim housing program of varying sizes. We have programs that are currently operating with a census of 25 all the way up to programs that are operating with the census of 160. None of those current programs have the exact configuration that this program would have, though comparable census, comparable room arrangements and what have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you. So the the we do not operate the current equivalents in terms of the where these houses sit in the neighborhood. I will say of the current non interim housing scattered site programs that we operate that are permanent housing of which we operate well over 20 homes in Alameda County of permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some that have existed, I'm happy to say, since the 1970s and have been continuous operation with folks that are formerly homeless living in those homes do some of those are well within a half mile of each other and some further beyond.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there's a team that works and provides the scattered site services across all of those homes. So it's certainly something you've operated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For decades.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now. Well, before I was on this earth in some of those cases.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That's all the questions. Well, actually, so there were multiple requests that we delay the item and have the community outreach first. Is there a reason why the decision needs to be made tonight as opposed to after having the community outreach meeting?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Happy to take that one. My. I believe their agency is around the fact that we don't currently have a single mentor for unhoused community members. And we were trying to move expeditiously to create an opportunity to house some of these folks, particularly since we're in the bad weather months.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our goal was to try to roll the houses online and make the available for people to move into probably one after the other one in particular is far closer to being ready and together. It's been a little bit more of a step up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So honestly, the goal, the urgency, and it's just around trying to help as quickly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we can. So which one is the closest to being ready? Do you know?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the big whites. And I don't remember the address of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't remember the address either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's what.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the two big lies. So I believe it's on Pearl Harbor and I could be wrong.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then currently the amount of so these and I think these have all been rented recently and have just recently become vacant. So what is the average rents that the city has been receiving for these properties?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe that the big lights are approximately 20 $800 a month. I calculated the total and it came to around 80,000 a year for the three homes and only the one is currently in a condition ready to be rented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The one on. And it is on Pearl Harbor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, thank you. The other two would need to go through a bit of a tight air before they would be available.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then we also receive complaints about from people who are current renters in the big lights of those homes have not been maintained that the city has actually done a really poor job of maintaining those homes. And and we heard tonight from a speaker that seems to think that they should get a reduction in their rent'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of 15%. What does the city seem to think about offering a reduction in rent to those homes?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just want to double check with the city attorney. Do you have any advice for us on discussing rent reduction?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am assuming the council member is asking this to understand the amount of rent that is being foregone in these opportunities. Is that correct, Councilmember?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I as long as the council member is considering the amount of rent being foregone as part of the analysis, and I think minimal questions in that area probably complies with the Brown Act.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So asking about the possibility of reducing current residents rent comes into that scope.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am assuming the council member is trying to understand how much rent revenue is. Rent is at stake for for approving this item. Is that right, Councilmember Spencer?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Well, we heard from a speaker that raised the concern. Also, there have been multiple comments online of the loss of revenue to the city. And how does that then how can we afford this program and other programs?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so my advice would be that, you know, questions would be tailored to how revenues would be lost if this program went forward versus, you know, continuing to rent out the rooms, you know, instead of going forward with the program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that would stay within the agenda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If staff doesn't want to question, I'm fine with it. I can ask another. So I'm sorry, Miss MacLeod. Did you want to offer anything?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was just going to share that. The rent range that I just was looking back at my notes is more like 28 to 30 $800 a month. And I have an I understand from my high you are asset management professional that we are somewhat below market currently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I know that you know, she would probably have some concerns. I don't put words in her mouth about a further rent reduction, but I know that she doesn't think we're right on mark at this moment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But earlier I thought the answer is that the city would be losing approximately 80,000 from the rent revenues from these three units. But if it's 20 to 3800 per month, and I think it actually for three units is actually higher than 80,000 lost revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And sounds.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Like you're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. So does the city know what the last rent was for each of these units?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't have. That's not my head. I can certainly get that information for you. I think two of them, like I said, haven't been immediately rented. They're sitting for a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then does the city have any other properties across the island other than. And we heard concerns about that. Could we as a city have housing across the island where it can stop filling when when a property becomes vacant, that then it can decide that it's going to put this housing in it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'None that I'm aware of, which is why we were attempting to utilize this opportunity, because it's a rare thing for us to have homes that we already own that could be potentially used for this opportunity. There wasn't really an intention to cluster the things on the West End.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It just happens to be where we have assets.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So does the city have homes anywhere other than the base? No, we don't. Not to our knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, not that I'm aware of at all. I don't believe so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll just throw in that. The idea of a housing trust that we've talked about.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is something that would allow a city to buy up, say, a foreclosed property or a property for sale at a good rate anywhere in the city and use it for such purposes. Other cities have done this. We don't have a housing trust yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I saw councilwoman actually. Did you have your hand up second and then we'll go to you, Councilmember. Okay, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why I didn't think I want to start my start my comments with a discussion I have with the city attorney, which is that I did want to notice that unbeknownst to me, my son announced that Max hired him on Friday afternoon, which we are very happy and proud of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In making that announcement, there are no financial we have to determine there are no financial recusals required. And I'm going to continue in this conversation. But I did want to but I did not need to. I wanted to put that out there just so that it would stick out there in the open.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My comments are pretty short. I actually came into this meeting generally having no comments other than that. I think it sounds like a great program that I'm excited to support. I do want to pick up on Councilmember Hirsch Spencer's concerns about the outreach not having been done ahead of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will acknowledge that we are pushing staff to move forward as fast as possible to address homelessness and whatnot. And sometimes we drop balls and make mistakes, whether by thinking we'll do it later and whatnot. I'm going to say it just for the neighbors listening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think this is an effort. This is one where I think we did not do this right. That said, I also think that we can move forward, work with some good neighbor, good neighbor agreements. And I know there's a city meeting set up to kind of discuss what that can look like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I continue to be supportive of moving this forward. I do also want to say to the conversations, because we've had a number of the conversations about these, you know, where are a lot of these things happening and why do they end up in the West?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have done the city inventory. We discussed it maybe a month ago here at the council, maybe six weeks ago. We also have given direction to staff to start looking more proactively at how we can find sites and make sites available in the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will likely take money, but I did want to see it continues to come up as there is a concern among speakers who come. We are aware that right now because of the Navy leaving, we have a lot of available things that we can use that that give us opportunities to move quickly when we have our few'",
        "'speaker_3': 'quickly years late, when we have a housing crisis and the ARPA money gives us that opportunity. And so, you know, we can be aware that, yes, things are landing maybe a little bit more heavily than we would choose if we had more options on on the West End.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we are also giving our staff direction to really start finding ways to help move things east as well so that, you know, all of our neighbors, our neighborhoods are being provided the services for our unhoused and folks needing support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you very much and thank you for for this work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, you're muted, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hello. I'm muted, counselor. I guess you're next.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Continuing on questions again, I think we should focus on the agreement, the contract that we are being asked to enter into. So again, focusing on the services, which is Exhibit A under a site management. There's a bullet point that states bullet point any complaints received from the business community?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Including but not limited to the businesses adjacent to the site or in the general vicinity. That bullet point would be a thing that the provider has to immediately notify the city about if there's any complaints. Now, is there any reason why we can't include residents?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That bullet point just focuses on business community. So that's a question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm only laughing because I emailed that same question. Council member.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good catch again. Same thing. Bullet point provider agrees to immediately notify the city should any of the following a clearer bullet point violence or credible threats against staff or other program clients. Again. What if there is violence or credible threats against residents?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Shouldn't the service provider notify the city? Final question, and this is more to the city. Once we get a series of these notices, what then? Okay. Thank you. The first two questions were for the provider. The last question was for the staff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So, Mr. Russell. Do you understand, Mr. Council, everyday folks questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, we'd be. We'd be happy to. To the degree that we have the ability to to sort of determine that community affecting relationship, obviously the presumption, again, thinking internal to our purview within the program or to business, just generally defaulting to those those relationships in which there's an effect on adjacent business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think we could apply that same principle to whatever the surrounding community is to the degree that we're aware and able to confirm. But even in unconfirmed cases like this has arisen, looks like it needs to be investigated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That investigation would need to include those that have authority relative to the neighborhood. And we would manage and comply from from bringing whatever program related information that we need to bear. So happy to do so. I think that some of that is the boilerplate language that needs to be rightfully modified.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And thank you for looking down to the letter of the contract, contract and the staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What do you do with the information?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Give me 1/2. Councilor Harry Spencer. Miss Maxwell or Miss Butler. Did you want to?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Certainly. I was just going to suggest that as to the contract, if counsel is inclined this evening to give instruction to proceed, we could we could include potentially direction to modify the contract to address those concerns of counsel and based on their excellent concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We could also potentially make sure that we have an opportunity for parting ways to the extent that you know, things where we're going poorly with the program and we had an excessive amount of complaints that we could have a conversation about specifically with that look.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it looks like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just a couple of suggestions for the contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I want to just hear from councilmembers we haven't heard from yet. And I see the vice mayor's hand. Is that the vice mayor of l.a. And then we'll go back to councilmember spencer. And I should ask, though, how some of our days are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You did have the floor. Had you finished all your comments and questions, you were okay. Okay. Back to you guys. Me Mavela.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I think we've kind of raised a number of questions about what would it cost? And it looks like on the on the upper side of things, it could cost that we would be potentially foregoing around $45,000 a year worth of rent or something like that per unit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But right now, these are three units that are currently not being rented, meaning that we're already forgoing the rental income on these units. And I think, you know, I mean, this is and then my second term on council and I remember during my first term, we had a number of folks that were coming to meetings saying, you've'",
        "'speaker_2': 'got all these empty houses at only two points. Why can't you use those to, you know, as housing or affordable housing or emergency housing? And now we're trying to do that and we're hearing, no, not there. And I think, you know, I certainly would have liked that we had done that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had we would have done the outreach ahead of time with the neighbors and those folks that are in the vicinity. I think that that's really important work to do. I would like to see that, you know, I'm glad we have one meeting scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope we can also schedule additional meetings if we need to, to allow for opportunities for questions and answers. But I also want to flag the fact that. You know, for years there have been suggestions that we do exactly what we're proposing to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We just now have the funding to do it, and we also have the open units that are going to be in a place that are suitable and habitable. And I think the other thing is we've sat through meetings where we've asked how many people need emergency housing, and we know that that number is very high and it's'",
        "'speaker_2': 'growing. We also have asked at other meetings how much we're spending when we have, for instance, an air quality issue, when we when we buy hotel vouchers. And this actually gives us units in the city of Alameda. It gives us beds in the city of Alameda for these emergency needs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that this is so critical and I'm sitting here, I've got the heater on in my house. You know, I've got and we're starting to see the weather change. It's getting colder out. We're seeing we have the with the atmospheric river occurring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is really an opportunity to make sure that we have those emergency beds available for people who reside in the city of Alameda. I also flagged the similar things in the in the contract. And, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to say that issues raised by residents, but perhaps just we can just keep it general'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and say neighbors or people within the vicinity. You know, I also want to note that we have in the contract requirements to keep documents, to keep reports that that information should be made available to the city, that those are official records.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, there are significant reporting requirements that are that are part of this contract, I think. And, you know, I think our staff perhaps could could make and or create an opportunity for a review if there is some sort of incident that's documented.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you know, I think that there this is really an opportunity where we're kind of I think there's an opportunity for us to really come together as a community around these units. And so, you know, I think that that that I would like to see that happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would like to see community buy in. I think these meetings are a good start and really allowing for space for us to have this conversation as a broader community. So I want to put that out there. I understand I know some of the folks, some of my friends live live out there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I understand that the issues that they're that are that they are raising. But I also know that these are very compassionate individuals. And if we sit down and speak with them and really engage folks, we can get to a place where where we can we can add these beds and we can do it without delay'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So I'm ready to support tonight provided that we set up an opportunity for that community input and not just limited to the one meeting and that we make some some tweaks to the the contract being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you both very well. I can't, however, decide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Two questions. First question is, is there any reason why we can't move ahead with one of the three in the first year and judge its performance, then move with the second and third? If, if, if? Is there any reason why we can't do that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Question.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I a miss Maxwell.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would ask if Mr. Russell could assist with that, because I have some concerns that the economy is a scale, one that would make one home operation of one home of interest backs. I question that, and I don't know the answer to it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I think we I think we would just need to look at what that what that would look like operationally in terms of the economies of scale, sort of to to invest the infrastructure to operate the project. It certainly is the volume that creates, I think, the the efficiencies, the economic efficiencies and which is to say nothing'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of the sort of community impact relative to the need. But that's it. That's of course a separate determination. So I think that would be looking at the at the ability there to do so and then what the what the cost difference would be in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think there would be just from, you know, as any business model small you have you have an inherent staff that you have to have no matter how big it is. And then you you scale up incrementally from there in some cases.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it would just be looking at the cost structure and the impact. And I think but we're happy to have whatever conversation that the council would direct with city staff if.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was determination along those lines and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'See what that looks like. Thank you, Mr. Russell. A second question. The second question for staff is, could we actually put together language that kind of says, you know, all these notifications that we're getting relative to what I just referenced, those sets of bullet points, you know, what is the could we actually put language tonight that says'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what is the level, the threshold level at which we would have to make some serious decisions in terms of go, no go or or does that have to take some more time? I would suspect it has to take some more time to put together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that's a question for staff, legal staff or program staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, I don't know that we can do it on the fly, this thing. I think it's a very doable request. I think we could come up with language that gave us the opportunity to make an election. The program wasn't working in this location to the extent we had a, you know, an agreed upon amount of material'",
        "'speaker_4': 'problems. But I think we'd have to craft language, and that would certainly be the assistance of Mr. Sharon's office. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know. I see the vice mayors had it, but Councilmember Harry Spencer's had her hand up for a while. So let me take you first, Councilmember Harry Spencer, and then we'll go to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The vice mayor. Thank you. So I did want to follow the members of the contract language. And just at the beginning and it's towards the end of the contract has what the noncompliance protocols are. But for those that are listening on TV, I want to say it says only the following reasons may be used as a basis'",
        "'speaker_2': 'for discharge from a facility. And the first one is possession of a weapon at the facility as opposed to possession of a weapon, not at the facility. And it continues similar to that possession of illegal drugs on the premises.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'However, apparently possession of illegal drugs not on the premises is not you may not be removed from the facility for that. So I think it is important that, in fact, I agree with I, I believe I've heard at least from a couple of council members that this contract provides that outside of the facility, we also would not'",
        "'speaker_2': 'want people having possession of a weapon, possession of illegal drugs, assault or violent behavior, theft, etc.. So I think that contract should be modified before or before we approve this item. I also do think it's important to have the meeting prior to agreeing to this and having community input.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that the rents could actually be higher than what staff has provided tonight, and I think that these homes, at least one of them has been rented very recently and is just not. The city has not rented it out and is holding it here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I would make a motion that we delay this decision until the next council meeting, which is immediately after the meeting with the public, which is is it's not that far away. It's already December, I believe the date is December six, which is then following the community outreach meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And at that time, I think this contract could be sorted out. I think the and and I don't think it is at all appropriate to proceed without the community outreach first. I think it's unfortunate that this has been brought to us without that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I really in regards to staff's comments that we didn't know we were going to have the project or not, so we didn't meet with the public in advance moving forward. And I think it's always important to reach out to them first before it comes here so that then we they get to be part of the process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They get to have their questions answered in advance. And it doesn't really put us in this position of hearing from so many people that they felt like they were excluded from the process. So I do move that. We bring this item back at the first next council meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Outreach.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. So we have had a motion to continue this item or bring it back in December. Do we have a second?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll second. It was comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I could I could wait to comment because I think Vice Mayor Vella wanted a question questionnaire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we're going to have a if we don't have a second, we're going to move on. Okay. Discussion. Do we have discussion or should we just take a vote? Okay. Discussion. Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My discussion is this. I think that this is a project that we can all be very, very proud of. I think 11 per unit is a little too high. But but to the extent that we tighten the contract, I'm willing to do it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm willing to try. We are in that housing crisis. But but I agree with Councilmember Herrera and that maybe we should kind of, you know, as they say in sewing measure twice before we cut once. So I think maybe a delay until next council meeting would be in order to deal with kind of the range of issues'",
        "'speaker_4': ', contractual issues that we waste on. So that's why I'm sticking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Any further discussion? Let's have a roll call. Madam Vice Mayor, please. You.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, you know, I think this this point is not necessary, hasn't necessarily been highlighted enough. But we have over 200 individuals as of our last point in time count that do not have housing in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is 200 people that are being forced to sleep and shelter outdoors that we are we are saying, you know what, we need to we're going to go ahead and wait. Even though we identified in our five year strategic plan just a month ago, we reiterated and passed that plan and we said this is a priority.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I just think we are saying these things from the safety and security and warmth of our own homes or our city. You know, all of us are housed and have housing here in Alameda. And I just I yes, I think it's important that we have these conversations with the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that we need to make sure that we have a contract. I do not want to delay this. And so that's why I'm not going to be supporting this motion tonight. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If I could stop you, because we're going to have to take now. We'll get back to you, Vice Mayor. We've got to we've got to do a quick roll call vote here, and then we have to do a housekeeping vote because it's coming on 11:00, believe it or not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second. I'm sure there's no more discussion because we need to take a quick roll call vote. And Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Am.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I said, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Max.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Avella. Now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor, as you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The motion fails 2 to 3.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay, Council what? We have to decide and we got to do it quickly because at 11:00 we all turned into pumpkins. But we've got to. So whoever said we were going to get through this whole calendar, I yes, you're right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what we might well say, we've got these items remaining. We've got the housing element is seven B, the general plan is seven C and parking management is seven D. Who wants to make a motion councilmember? Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well. So I'm going to preface this with I would like us to consider putting we have a fifth to Tuesday between now and the seventh. This the seventh is going to be vision zero and a whole bunch other stuff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We there is no way we are getting through the work. So what I'd like to I will make a motion now for, for this part of the calendar, but I'm really hoping we can consider calling a special meeting on one of the two Tuesdays between now and the seventh or another day.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To hear the rest of this agenda. I would like to move that. We hear item seven, which I think is probably one of the shorter items. I do not think we have time to even begin talking about the housing element or the general plan tonight at 1051 and any of the referrals that are remaining as long as'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we end before midnight and with the idea of moving the rest of the items to a special meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we could hear regular items and go up to midnight. Is that what you're saying here?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Seven D and then the and then the in any outs any referrals that that got we just got out of the way that we could that that that fit in the end there's only going to be 15 minutes or something by the time we get done with all this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't think we're moving too fast on this stuff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I am. Okay. I'm not going to support moving to referrals tonight, but you have made your motion. Do we have a second? Was that you, Councilmember de SAC?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A second was a quick comment. My quick comment is I agree that the housing element and general plan should be a special meeting. I think most cities do it that way. That's my second.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't disagree. I think we're going to have a hard time around the Thanksgiving holiday because key staff incentives, council members may be out of town.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Myself included.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could try. Okay. However, we need to, we need to take a vote. Okay. So. So Councilmember Cox why made a motion council Desai his seconded it. Let's take a roll call vote. I'm sorry. We have a discussion cast over here, Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Just real quick, I will not be supporting this. I would rather just continue and at least start the draft housing element so that we could. We start towards that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Vice Mayor Vella.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd be supportive of finding a way to add a meeting in between now and the next meeting for the housing element.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But it couldn't be on a Tuesday because we wouldn't be able to have everyone we need. That's my.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Point, but I'm happy to try to see if we can find a day. I'm not saying necessarily necessarily a Tuesday, but we will. We could ask for OC.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have a motion before us. Councilmember Knox. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. We need four to have already said they are not going to support it. So I'm going to withdraw my motion and make the following motion that we were and we finished this item. We direct staff to find a time that works for the most council members possible between now and the seventh to hold a special meeting'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And I want to be really clear in my language that I am saying that most council members like this is if somebody has to miss the meeting or whatever, then it has to. If has to be me, it has to be me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we've got to get our work done and I feel like it's because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We only have a few minutes before this is all going to be moot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So may I say something? Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes? I'm so sorry to interrupt, but you would need to identify that date and continue these items to that date, specifically tonight, because we don't have time to notice another meeting. So you would have to the date would have to be set as part of the vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your muted Catherine's just a presence question we only need to make the decision before 11:00 to hear new items. Can we not get to figure out the date after 11:00? Yes. For a continuation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, you can do that after 11:00. But I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure it was clean.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's good to make sure. Gives us a little bit more time and breathing in whenever it's up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To you and to contemplate the motioned Councilmember Harry Spencer was suggesting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't see a value in starting a conversation on the housing element and then stopping and then at some random time in the future, having public comment come in. I, I just that you're going to have different people there, etc..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's late. I don't. Should be a special meeting. We're going to have half a few people are going to comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. I'm going to limit the editorial comment just because we've got to get something that four people agree on or when it hits 11:00, we just finish this item. Is that correct, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. To finish this item. And then you can do that. City Manager Communications. All communications.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And telecommunications.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So in 4 minutes remaining, does anyone want to try to offer a motion? Vice Mayor of L.A. You're pretty good at that sort of thing. Or council rehearsed better. Perhaps the two of you. Quickly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wanted to make a motion that we could just continue until midnight and start with this. The next item. Which is the housing element. It's a draft, and I think we need to start it. So people can we start thinking about our feedback and where the staff is?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Anybody anywhere? Councilmember Vela Well, everyone, a second or a tweak or something. Quickly. Vice mayor, any thoughts?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would prefer that we just continue that item, the housing element item. I my preference isn't to start it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And would you continue it to that item six on the next semester?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Is that emotion so moved? Okay. Do we have a second counselor and not quite chime in? How can we make this better?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that's going to be a multi-hour conversation with Vision Zero and everything else. We just put three other items before everything like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We got it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can we? Okay. So can we, can we continue it to a special meeting or. We have to we have to take the date tonight. I have to pick the date.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or we can look we could agree to take one more item after this. And then after that we can discuss the date. Is that correct, Madam Clerk? But we've got to make a decision about what to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do after the.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11:00 vote is just if you want to have a new item after 11. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How about we take that parking item after about 70?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How about we start with item seven? I'll make that motion. Okay. After this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Do we have a second?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll second that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, so let's have a roll call vote. Does everyone understand we're making a motion to continue this item and then take seven D and then we'll look at dates. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, so I'm ready to proceed, sir.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I i.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ashcraft I that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Carries by 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With 2 minutes to spare. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Where were we? Who did I cut off? Was it. Is it you, Madam Vice Mayor? I think.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the last motion failed. And so we were going to. Perhaps make an emotion. Well, no, we're we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're moving we're moving forward. We just passed that motion. We had four votes. We're going to hear more than 70. But you're talking about this item, the seven a?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. So my I was just making the point about the the the fact that we have over 200 unhoused individuals. That number has continued to grow in double digit percentages year over year. And we're in winter months. We know that there's weather events and everything else happening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, this is economy of scale, but at the same time, it's phasing it in. We're not we're not opening up all of these units. So I would like to move support of this with a direction to staff.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I know, Madam Mayor, you still have to give your comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As I've just like. But yeah, you go ahead, make them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'd at least like to get a motion on, on the table with, with, you know, with the comments around the contracting language being change, because I think that that needs to there needs to be some amendments there and then also that there be direction to have more than one community meeting, because I do think that that that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'will be needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will second that motion and I will offer a comment. Shall I offer comment? I will wait for you, Madumere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You better wait for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I will wait.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If you want to stay on my good side. No, I appreciate everybody's comments and. And staff. And I appreciate Backes getting here in a hurry. Thank you. This is what I think. And I have had the privilege of visiting a site that backs Rand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I've also talked with the mayors of Brooklyn, the mayor, the mayor, Brooklyn's one mayor, the mayors of Brooklyn and Oakland, about the incredible success they've had with backs at housing sites that that are run as co-housing in different neighborhoods where they've been able to buy up housing and and rehab it and it it's worked really well'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the value of using an organization like Bax and congratulations Councilwoman Oxlade and your son working for them is they they have the track record. I didn't know how far back it went, but I know how extensive, especially in the housing crisis it has been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and I just have to a really quick aside, when we visited the navigation center in Berkeley, which isn't this at all, it's like two dormitory style. One is for men, one is for women. There's, you know, bathrooms, communal bathrooms for men and women and a garden and all that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But talking to the residents there. There was a fellow we talked to who was a professor at Cal who had, you know, fallen on hard times, had an illness, ended up homeless, and yet this was, you know, getting him back on his feet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just there are so many ways that people become homeless. But I agree with everything that has been said about it would have been preferable to do the communication piece ahead of time. I also want to remind us that we stretch our minimal staff pretty thin.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so they this this I mean, there are only so many hours in a day to do these things. It's not a reason to delay this project because, as has been noted, we have a housing crisis. It's been a long time coming, you know, waiting to do something like this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I think that knowing that we're working with back at a trusted and experienced provider gives me a lot of confidence. However, what we also learned from doing these field trips in San Jose and Mountain View is it is critical to have good communication with the neighbors, to have a team, to have an advisory committee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The neighbors deserve to not only feel that they're being heard to be heard. And I fully expect them to be open minded and to allow themselves to be persuaded to learn more. But that road goes both ways. So communication is key.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're a little late starting, but we'll catch up. We'll get there. I'm confident that staff and personnel are capable of doing that. I did hear some neighbors talk about encampments in the area. I haven't this week been out to the area, but staff I do expect staff to be on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am really pleased that the day center is now open overnight. I just ran into Joey Harrison, who who runs a facility last night at an event. And he was so excited to tell me that two individuals who'd been previously sleeping out in public somewhere, they had eventually persuaded them to come.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And they're sleeping overnight there and they come and go during the day. And it's made a huge difference. So please, let's go out and reach out to the folks in these encampments, get them connected with Village of Love.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, maybe we can even get them into some of these programs because they you know, the neighbors raised this. And it's a concern. And we don't want people sleeping in encampments. We want them sleeping sheltered. And the other thing I just want to throw out, it's an idea that I learned about from the League of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'California Cities webinar on addressing homelessness or homelessness solutions. The City of Riverside has a expansive homelessness outreach program, and one of the things they've done is they've created a registry almost like if there is someone's getting married and they have a registry or, you know, something, having a baby.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what it is, the whoever they contract with has a wish list of the things they need to furnish these various units and they put them up there. It's it can go through Lowe's or whoever, you know, printed these sort of things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And community members can go on to the site and buy these furnishings and furnish these sites. It's just a way to promote community awareness and also a little buy in to a very, very valid program. The the only thing that I would add, other than what's been said about making sure that there's also a mechanism for dealing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'not only with businesses in the area, because really there's more residences in the area in any problems they might be having with the residents of these homes. But is also I do not support using funds, ARPA funds to buy a car for this program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When I asked the question of staff why a car? And they said, well, you know, some time back staff would drive it because sometimes people need to go to a doctor's appointment or to the DMV. That's fine, but we don't need to buy a car.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can contract with a local taxi company for taxi vouchers or something, but a car, the city using RPA funds to buy a car. And the insurance issues we don't usually are not in the business of transferring people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would respectfully ask that the purchase of a vehicle not be included if at some point it just becomes indispensable. But buying a car to go to occasional appointments doesn't seem like the best use of these dollars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like them to go further. So anyway, I am. I'm really excited about moving this forward. I also have. Said to staff that to the extent that there are families available and families couch surfing, in my mind, maybe there's some legal reason they can't use it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But these are homes with yards of backyards and places for kids to run around and there could definitely be a co-housing model. I think that's possible. So just keep that in mind just because I think it's a lovely opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I am ready to go full speed ahead on this. Councilmember Dysart, back to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. You know, if I can just speak to the residents who live in the surrounding areas, I certainly hear the concerns that you have raised. And so I think to the extent possible, try to scrutinize the contract that we we have before us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I do believe that I found some shortcomings in there. And I think I have to trust our staff, both our city manager and his staff and our city attorney and and his staff, that they've listened to the concerns that not just me, but everyone else on council has raised, and that we will strengthen the contract that's'",
        "'speaker_4': 'before us. I do think that this is a rare opportunity to quickly address the homeless crisis that we're having, not just in the in our area, but in our city itself. And so, again, with the arc of funds that we have available, we can do something that we had never we had not been able to do before'",
        "'speaker_4': '. But I think you're right, though. I think the the contract has to be strengthened, because I think there are some areas in there that seem to be obvious in terms of like making sure that we contractually include the concerns of residents along the lines that we had discussed earlier.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's why I'm going to support this. And, you know, I think in the end, Alameda point, especially the big white area, I think as a city, we'll all be better for it to have a mixed community that that we're we've been contemplating for Alameda point not just the big whites area but also around city and other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'places.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember Desai. Councilmember Harris Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. So I will not be supporting this. I think that it's truly unfortunate that we're not doing the public outreach in advance prior to this. I also do think that the community has been asked to. I think it really is already a mixed use community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we I think that they raised legitimate concerns, but I think that they absolutely needed to be involved in the conversation before this came to us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And Madam Vice Mayor, just want to restate that motion, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I had moved too to move forward with with this with the comments relative to addressing the contract as proposed from the council and then also requiring that there be more than more community engagement meetings so that there can be responsiveness to the community concerns raised.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Chair, I don't think your your request to remove the funding for the car. That's fine with me. I don't know if I need to amend the motion, but I don't have a problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I would appreciate if you would. Okay. And so Viceroy Villa made the motion she submitted in council every day. So you certainly didn't. You? Okay. Thank you. Okay. May we have a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so every day shock.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Over Spencer. No knocks like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rella high.'",

We heard you, and we will heed you. And we will be looking forward to hearing from you more and incorporating your thoughts and comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is an important first step, big step forward. Yet another one tonight. So. Okay, everyone go forth and do good work. Thank you so much. All right. We are going to quickly change.'",

    "Reorganization of Parking Management Program and Parking Fund and Related Salary Schedule Changes.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'A recommendation to reorganize the city's parking management program and parking fund and adoption of related resolutions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. And so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Look.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At that. Like magic, they appear. So who is? And I just want to say to Miss Smith, who I know we had a conversation maybe a week ago, and I told you we'd hear your item today. We did it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Look at all of you. Hi. Hi. We've got Captain Jeff Emmett from HPD. We've got our public works director, Aaron Smith. We have our planning bill and transportation director Andrew Thomas and Lisa Foster, who has a title in transportation that is escaping me at the moment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But she'll introduce herself. Who's going to take the lead on this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm going to jump in. It's Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thomas, my planning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Director. There's more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Listen, the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Board.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where this has been a multi departmental effort, some just want to recognize and thank the public works department and the police department for their help on this as well. It's really been a big team effort. And I'm going to turn it over to Lisa Foster, who will present our joint recommendation for moving forward with the reorganization of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the parking program here in Alameda. Take it away, Lisa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right. Thanks for that introduction, Mr. Thomas. Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the Council. I'm Lisa Foster, senior transportation coordinator with the City of Alameda. And I'm here with colleagues to represent the staff recommendation that the city council approved resolutions to make two things happen, and those are to move parking enforcement, parking enforcement from police'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to public works and establish a single inclusive parking management fund. And both changes were endorsed unanimously by the Transportation Commission. And since we haven't spoken about Parking Management Program as a whole for a while, I wanted to put this effort into context.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Public parking and curb space usage are part of the transportation system in the public right of way. And when we manage parking, that is part of managing transportation and can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If we can use parking, pricing and time limits to achieve an 85% parking occupancy goal, which means that a driver is'",
        "'speaker_5': 'able to get into a space more quickly, thus reducing circling and double parking. And it can also be used to create incentives for people to use other modes. Managing parking also increases safety whenever we reduce circling. That's less time for drivers driving across crosswalks in dense areas.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Reducing double parking keeps vehicles out of bike lanes and red zones, and many of those red zones are there for very important safety reasons. We can increase economic vitality by ensuring parking space availability for visitors and facilitating loading and short term parking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We support transit by reducing double parking and incentivizing transit use, and we protect the environment not only by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but when we enforce street sweeping that can help prevent stormwater pollution. We have several plans that call for parking management, the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan, the Alameda Point Transportation Management Plan, and the Transportation Choices'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Plan. All call for parking management, including paid parking at all ferry terminals, adjusting pricing to 85% occupancy. And then the Commercial Streets program that you discuss the council discussed at the last meeting speaks to have a new short term disability and loading zones on Park and Webster.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in 2019 and early 2020, staff were working on improving the parking management program in general and gearing up to meet the increasing needs of Alameda Point and City Council approved expanding the parking enforcement program with two new full time parking technician positions and continued use of part time positions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council also approved amending the Alameda Municipal Code to enable mobile payment and electronic permits and to set parameters within which the Public Works Director can adjust hourly parking meter rates to achieve an 85% occupancy target of the code.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Also defined specific uses for excess parking rate funds, including alternative mode programs and painting curbs for loading and facility parking. And then the pandemic hit. And, you know, it changed everything in our lives. Parking is a small part of it relative to everything that was going on, but it did impact the parking program significantly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with the shelter in place, order meter revenue plummeted 92% between April 2019 and April 2020. And then at the request of businesses, the Commercial Streets program shifted almost all of the parking along core business areas of Park and Webster to free 15 minute pick up and drop off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our meter revenue has increased in 2021, but it's still about 40% lower than we had in a similar month in 2019. So the results are we have not filled those full time parking enforcement positions. We haven't established paid parking at our very terminals.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we had to decommission multiphase meters on two blocks of Park Street because they were old machines and it wasn't worth paying the monthly fees when we weren't using them. So having the parking program so diminished provides an opportunity to think about how best to rebuild the program and what structure would best help the city achieve its'",
        "'speaker_5': 'goals related to transportation, safety, economic vitality and more. And staff from police, public works and transportation planning have collaborated to develop a plan, two steps of which were taken to tonight. First to create a public works parking enforcement program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This would move public parking enforcement from police to public works, allowing a greater focus and connection to transportation goals. Unlike moving violations like speeding, parking enforcement does not need to be done by sworn personnel. And it's very common for parking enforcement to occur in departments that are responsible for transportation or public works rather than law enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Public Works Parking Enforcement Program would have a new look and feel with a new logo. New uniforms with a feel of more. Speaking more to parking as a service rather than about law enforcement. The public works parking enforcement technicians without clearance to access personally identifying information which simplifies hiring, training and privacy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But because you need to be able to run a plate to tell those technicians to coordinate with police when a vehicle needs to be towed because it's in the driveway or in front of a fire hydrant, etc.. This is also another common setup.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to support that, police would retain for those for currently filled part time positions for this, as well as traffic control and other police support. Second, we recommend creating a single parking fund. An effective program requires financial planning and the ability to allocate resources to improve the program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Currently, program revenues and expenses are tracked in separate funds. Parking revenues from meters and larch are placed in the parking fees of civic center garage funds. Expenses for parking enforcement are in the police department. Budget and parking citation revenues go into the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So staff recommends bringing these together into one fund with three divisions as shown here. We see several benefits of this. It would allow financial planning across all facets of parking management, with the goal of meeting no general fund support in the short term citation revenues being in the mix will help the parking fund recover from the pandemic'",
        "'speaker_5': 'revenue losses and invest in the equipment and staffing needed to meet the growing needs in commercial corridors, ferry terminals and Alameda Point. In the long term, we expect the fund to generate excess revenues, which council can decide where to direct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the next priorities that we see are to establish that public works enforcement program and equip it, recruit the enforcement positions, reestablish parking management and enforcement on commercial corridors, and begin paid parking at Seaplane Lagoon. Prioritizing that particular terminal because of the AC Transit pilot bus line that is going to that terminal and will go away if'",
        "'speaker_5': 'people don't take the bus. Achieving these priorities will include steps that require more involvement from council moving forward. So this is just the first step. Things like we might need to change the Alameda Municipal Code to allow non-police employees to enforce parking violations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Approving rates for seaplane, lagoons, purchasing meters and more. And we we do plan to include additional budget allocations for these things in the Midcycle budget review. So in summary, we recommend that the City Council approve this to recommend these two resolutions, and I will close there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As you heard, there are many staff members here to help field questions and join in the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Good timing with 37 seconds left. But he wanted to say anything quickly. How about if I will? Let me ask this, Madam Clerk, do we have any public speakers on this item?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, a few.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A few. Okay. Counsel, do we have any clarifying questions before we go to our public speakers? Councilmember Harris Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. In regards to the theory, parking, any moneys received, do they get split with Rita or what happens to money collected for ferry parking?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That if if the city initiates parking fees at the ferry terminals, that the revenue would all be coming to the city. Into this parking fund. It's not split with we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And other clarifying questions. Let's take our public comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have five right now, so they still get 3 minutes. The first is sack bowling.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker bowling.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Evening Council. I just wanted to voice my support of moving parking enforcement out of the police department into public works. I'm also in favor of ferry terminal parking fees to help limit excess parking at that facility and encourage more bus and transit usage to the ferry terminal, which should help spur at least some encouragement to AC transit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that line, the new 78 bus line that we have installed is going to be widely used and not competing with car traffic. And I'll leave my comments there. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Amanda Chair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Speaker Cheer.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to support this move from parking enforcement to its public works out of PD. As you all know, a parking employee and slash volunteer slash wannabe cop is a person involved in the murder of Mario Gonzalez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's very clear that APD doesn't really have the capacity to handle managing that particular staff. I appreciated that separately. The vision was also outlined in your presentation about how this ties into a larger transportation issue. And I would encourage, as you move through these issues council and it comes up again and again that traffic also be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'considered in this traffic stops are really deadly for black and brown people and in our country. And we all know that because, you know, you just have to watch the news to know that and and that this be part of a larger conversation of how we can move away from traditional policing and think about different ways to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'keep our community safe. But definitely support this and appreciate you taking the time to hear it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ryan read.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker. Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor and city council members. I am calling because while I am in favor of that and of of the parking being being part of the of the new program, I am against the paid parking at the ferry terminals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the reason why is because the ferry tickets are already quite expensive and increasing the cost of people's daily commute is extremely burdensome on families and it continues to create inequities in our community. So I ask that you take that into consideration where we what we would likely see are wealthy residents being able to park their cars'",
        "'speaker_2': 'at the ferry terminals and maybe the average resident who is trying to make their way. Maybe also people who have other other financial stressors wouldn't be able to do so. And especially as people are dropping their kids off at school or, you know, trying to do other things for their families anyway.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm I'm against the paid parking at the ferry terminals. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, speaker dara abrams.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. I just wanted to offer some brief positive comments on this proposal. A good complement to the item two weeks ago from remembering last meeting on a parking parking maximums. And so I got to offer some positive comments on that, both as a resident of the East End and a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'co-owner of a small business on Park Street in a built in a building that has no off street parking. So it's really great to see these programmatic levers that the city can potentially make use of to now make better use of the parking that is built.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So very much glad to see this coming along at the same time as the changes that remove parking minimums and replace them with parking maximums. I just want to very briefly offer one additional thought in case it isn't under consideration by city staff that thinking of a parking brokerage model for the business districts where I know lots'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of folks have talked about how they park in other businesses lots when those businesses are closed. Technically speaking, you look up at that sign and it says, legally, you can't park here. There are ways that the city could make that more straightforward for businesses to pool their parking, whether it's in a parking lot that is legally branded'",
        "'speaker_3': 'as a city facility or through another means. Because I think as the city makes parking easier for residents and shoppers to use, there are other ways to expand and brand other parking lots as well. And finally, I do also want to echo the comment made earlier that a good goal that out of way out of context or'",
        "'speaker_3': 'scope for this item. But I think a good ultimate goal is also moving traffic enforcement out of the police department and looking at traffic and transportation issues in a more holistic manner. So thank you for taking this feedback.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have three more speakers now, which puts us at the seven limits of the speakers we'll get to. And next is Morgan Bennett. Morgan Bellinger.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Bollinger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I applaud the city's efforts to bring as many services as possible out from under the purview of our violent police department. I have a simple question for you all. Who should pay for parking? I can tell you who pays for it now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When we use the general fund to pay for parking maintenance expenses, all Alameda taxpayers pay for it. Even seniors and folks who can't afford a car. When we fail to enforce daylight and bike lane violations, cyclists and pedestrians pay for it with their bodies.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When we declined up zone because it would impact street parking, the unhoused in Alameda paid for it. I'm begging council to go beyond the proposal in front of you. It's clear from comments on numerous items tonight that we need to separate our parking problems from our housing problems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Parking as a function of public works is a great first step, but why draw the line for 85% occupancy at the business districts? Some of you know how hard it is to find a spot at night when neighbors have no motivation not to park six cars on the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Please consider implementing street parking permits from 2 to 4 a.m. across the entire island so that people who use parking can be the ones who pay for it. This will allow us to build housing while limiting the number of cars and traffic that prospective residents bring with them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jim Strelow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, Speaker Strelow.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also on staff California law enforcement transactions class does not allow non sworn law enforcement officials access to their vehicle data. Thus, illegally parked vehicles blocking bike lanes or streets cannot be checked for stolen or all points. Bulletin status.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All the public works can do is just take up that vehicle, move along when the police could have run the vehicle for its history. Yeah. Your put public works employees and general public at risk with the inability to check license plates for crimes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a public works employee approaches the vehicle, that employer will be at risk if the vehicle was reported stolen and the driver of the vehicle's occupants are potentially dangerous. I trust law enforcement officers. I do not trust elements of public works, discriminatory practices of favoring bicycles against vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, public works employees choose to not ticket illegally parked bicycles. Bad guys from Oakland and other nearby cities can also double dump their stolen vehicles or parked their vehicles in Alameda parking spaces. How does this program reduce circling and double parking when parking spaces are not available in the city continues to reduce the number of parking spaces'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I see Amazon, FedEx, UPS, double parking throughout the city daily, particularly blocking bike lanes because you must coordinate with police for towing vehicles. It will then take paying to Alameda City employees to enforce towing when it used to take just one employee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Also, I'm against paid parking at Seaplane Lagoon in order to promote fair use. There is no paid parking at the Main Street Ferry terminal now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's our it'll be our final speaker, Dennis Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Good evening, Speaker Anderson.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I just wanted to echo Savannah and say that I support this. I think that the fewer. People on the street with guns interacting with our community better. And I also wanted to say that I don't support paid parking up a very maybe some at some point in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But right now, I don't think that it's appropriate. And we never did it at the Main Street terminal. And when somebody doesn't, to my knowledge, go out there on the weekends, which is when it's really popular to be used.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I get somebody working. Thank you, Adam.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had one more speaker right there speaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Evening. Speaker Jeopardy!'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, council members. I'll keep this really brief. I know it's a long night. I just want to say that bipoc alameda strongly support staff's recommendation, especially around the paid parking at the ferry terminal. Yeah, it's true. We haven't had paid parking at the ferry terminals before.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We also haven't had transit access to the ferry terminals before. And it's also my understanding that this paid parking would only be during the week. But I could be wrong about that. But anyway, we strongly, strongly encourage anything that will help us capture some of the the costs that we are supporting as taxpayers now, where we're subsidizing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'driving in Alameda by providing free parking. So strongly recommend this proposal. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Any last speakers, Madam Clerk?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. With that, I am going to close public comment on item seven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'D.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we will return to the council. So, Councilmember Harris Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. I want to follow up on some of the comments that were made from the public speakers, and I'll I'll try to remember them. And you might remember better than I do. In regards to currently the police is that sworn officers that are doing the checking the meters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, no.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right now. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where we left the map did better. Thank you. And by the way, I'll call on the people to answer. Captain Emmett, can you address us?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So small officers can enforce parking violations. We try not to use word officers for that. We are a little short on the parking technician side, but when we have them available, we do use our parking technicians or our police service technicians, which are also professional staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're not sworn police officers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. So when there's a car. So how do we know? Like if someone does have a stolen car, do they do well? Will these people now be able to run the license plates or will they have the I think some cars, some of our police cars, these have the cameras so that they can check to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'see if they're still already here, if they have a plate on it, what followup will there be when it's moved over to public works?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Captain Emmett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I'll speak to the police involvement side. When a public works parking enforcement employee finds a vehicle that they believe is stolen or comes back as stolen, they will contact the police department. If a vehicle is stolen, it will necessitate a sworn police officer to respond.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it is a vehicle that needs to be towed for blocking a private driveway or that needs to be cited for parts on private property, which would require to run the license plate to identify the registered owner, they would be able to call the police department and we would send an employee out that has access through Platts'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to run that license plate to identify the registered owner.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Captain Emmett. How would you? I'm assuming you'll do some or APD will do some obstruction. How? How would a public works parking enforcement person suspect that a vehicle was stolen?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outlet public works. Take that and fill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My understand.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Actually. I've got. Okay. Public works.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead. Matt Smith. You go first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so my understanding how that works is the police department will be able to give us what's called a hotlist. So those are license plates that can be loaded into the handheld device that although the public works parking technicians aren't certified and aren't seeing any owner information, we are able to confirm if it on the hotlist and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'then coordinate with the police department as needed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Go ahead, Councilor Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So we get, you know, Amber Alerts on our phones with those be immediately put into this hotlist then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As stolen vehicles are entered into flats by the agency that takes the initial report. It depends on when that originating agency puts the vehicle into the system. So sometimes it's immediate. Sometimes it could be several hours after the report is taken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It depends on the agency.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Captain Emmitt, if I could just ask you to tell us what the acronym stands for, if you would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's California law enforcement telecommunications system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. Yes, it's going normally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Since I made this information, I go to the police, LAPD, but now it goes from APD to public works. So does that happen seamlessly somehow whenever APD does find out?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ever. Yes. Miss Smith, do you want to talk about the devices that you referenced? But what will these parking enforcement folks be using?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can speak generally. I will say I don't have the level of detail that Councilmember Herrera Spencer is getting out, but it is an item that we will work out the details on. So tonight, obviously, we're seeking direction for this transition.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we've done a lot of a lot of legwork to assess the viability.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of moving in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This direction with the specifics of how frequent the hotlist will upload to the handheld devices. I don't have that answer for you tonight, Councilmember Spencer, but I know we will work out those details. But when I'm mentioning a handheld device, I had the opportunity to go on a ride along with actually our existing police technician, parking enforcement'",
        "'speaker_2': 'technician in the police department. And they are the devices that issue the tickets we might get into the discussion. It's the license plate reader that's different than the automatic license plate reader policy that's being talked about separately. This is literally just a handheld device that is able to scan the license.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then instead of the technician having to punch that license plate into the handheld device that issues ticket, it puts it right in there and it enables the parking technician to take a couple of photographs to document.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Situation and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Then to issue the ticket, print it right from the handheld device. So that's the unit that I'm talking about in the specifics of how that hotlist gets on to that, we will, following this meeting, work out those those details.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And do the cars currently of our parking technicians have cameras on them? No. No. Okay. Okay. So there's no loss of services in that respect. Someone raised the issue of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anyone that's getting a ticket that is not happy to be getting a ticket. Will our text from Public Works somehow be trained similarly to the text that we have from our police department currently? Yeah. Many are. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, go ahead. I was calling on you. That's fine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have Waiting in the wings following the nine Dixon Consulting, their parking experts that we will be developing a program manual that will include training specifically training generally and specifically to target issues of any sort of altercation while issuing a ticket.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then the parking meters that we used to use pre-COVID, they would operate, I believe, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and then people could parking spaces before or after those hours for no charge. What is the city's plan moving forward in regards to hours of me having the meters, the active?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We don't we don't and haven't gotten to that level of detail. And that's something that we don't plan on changing any and in the immediate future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not not been brought up at all. I mean, I think our immediate priority is is going to be enforcement of of what is the the ferry terminal has been talked about that's not being voted upon tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's going to take a separate effort in and of itself to establish those rates. Okay. So. But tonight, are we being asked to approve paid parking at the site? No, no, that's not what I'm things. So in regards to what we're being asked to approve tonight, it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the first would be to transfer it to public works. And then there's this budget. And can you go over how much more money is is going to cost the city?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The next hour. I missed you, Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I'm. In terms of how much more. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think. I think Miss Smith had a go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's all right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'She's right above you. My script.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Was taken. We're actually voting on is the establishment of a new fund. So single parking funds, like an umbrella fund where they'll be three divisions within there. The program is anticipated to be self-sufficient, so we're not infusing money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as the program continues to grow, it's going to take us a bit to kind of constitute the program, but it'll generate sufficient revenue and then they'll likely be excess revenue, which will be a council policy decision on what to do with that excess revenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And when I say excess, meaning the revenue will support operations and then anything above and beyond operational needs would be able to be transferred elsewhere for other purposes. And so I won't add one more item. So for tonight, we again, we're just seeking direction that this is acceptable to council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We do have a bit more work to do to really detail out the total cost of the program, transition, things like. So I keep bringing up the handheld device, but it is one like the police department has four of them and well they will, they need to keep two and we need to buy two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Like there's just some real specific stuff that we didn't.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Want to get.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Too far down. There's also vehicles that have come up. We will we do anticipate needing additional vehicles as the program grows, but we're not asking for any money tonight. We'll do some homework. And Lisa, I thought your presentation was awesome.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's one thing at the end.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where you said mid-cycle I think will probably be coming at mid-year with any sort of budget, new budget appropriations for any program expenses, because I think by February we'll know what we need. So will you be coming back?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, when you the current rates do use the meters. Will that be changing without just fluctuate whenever you think 85% is there or is that part of what we're being asked today? We're not asking for any change in meter rates this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. As their council comments are a motion council vote next Friday. Phil, I see your hand about to go up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. You seem to do a lot of clicking without hitting that. But I want to I want to both thank our staff for the great presentation and work I as a point of personal privilege, I'm just going to recognize I think I have done this in the past, but Miss Fosters has been a part of some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the US kind of leading parking policy and program development and operations around, around the country. And so I just want to say we have, you know, we have so many great staff working here, but I want to recognize her specifically in this in this arena.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I plan to support this. I really want to encourage our staff as we're starting to put together the work program, to really think about how we can make other cities like San Francisco do use these parking control officers to address issues like double parking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, just parking in the middle of a traveling around schools. Right. So we know that would middle school 15 minutes before school gets out. You know, you have cars in both directions on Grand Street just parking in the middle of the street and waiting to pick up their kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, they're not moving. They're double parked. We can we can issue double parking tickets for that and address some of the key safety concerns that are being raised by parents around those schools using these parking tickets at a time when when other parts of the city are less used and they probably need less and less parking'",
        "'speaker_3': 'enforcement. So I just I want to encourage us to really think about how we can deploy these folks in ways that other cities do to address a wide, very wide range of different. Issues. And then also just want to encourage that as as necessary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we we know that before the pandemic, you know, this this will allow us to start putting into place our parking pilot, our parking program. But we know that parking was heavily impacted in the evenings. It was very hard to find a parking space around Park Street and Webster Street Street at seven or 8:00 at night'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And people complained that they were they were leaving. We can use parking pricing in those hours to actually make sure that there's always spaces to be found for people who want to pick up food, etc.. And so looking for ways that we can have those policies kind of come back as a part of our economic support, you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know, outside the current hours, I think will be really important. So yeah, I'm happy to say I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Want to make was a motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To make a motion motion that we approved that we adopted the staff recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't start with seconds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I want to make sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And vice mayor of. That a second.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have a recording.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We've had emotion. We've had a second. I'll say a couple things. Councilor Woodside, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. Well, thank you. I think that parking enforcement is better left in the hands of our police department. I think they're neutral. Unbiased. Individuals who just want to enforce our parking laws. And I think that's what the residents need, is people who are able to enforce our parking laws in a neutral, unbiased manner.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm not going to support the staff's recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm I'm going to just chime in as I'm not so muted right now. I'm just cause I'm the keeper of the council rules on meeting conduct. I get a bit concerned when I hear what sounded like an inference that some of our city staff are biased.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, there may be reasons you think that police should continue doing this. That seemed a bit accusatory. So I will express my dismay because we try not to our council falls state that we do not make personal attacks on each other, staff, members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I would just ask all of us to please bear that in mind. Councilmember Herrera. Spencer, you have your hand up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I'm not sure that I heard the comments the same way you did, but I wanted to get back to in response to our police, it's my understanding that our police is agreeable to transferring this responsibility to public works and after and I don't know if our police you do if you review the program'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that you could give any reasons supporting why you think this could work as opposed to having police here. But if you are in fact supporting this transfer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're asking Captain Emmett. Captain Emmett, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, we do support it 100%. And it's going to be a process that we're more than happy to help them to be successful. And we have training outlines and training programs that we can provide to public works to help them create their own and to train their staff and to take on the responsibility.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And for us, it's we've had a difficult time hiring for those positions in the past. And I think transferring it over to public works hopefully will be the city will be more successful in being able to staff those positions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we do we do support it and we plan on being there to support them and help them through the process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Captain Emmett. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Offer you say thank you. And I really appreciate that insight in regards to the hiring. And I thought that was a very important point that I hadn't thought of. So thank you. And I found a supportive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And I just want to say that I also support this and thank you to all the staff members for bringing this forward. We talk about how short staffed we are in police, in the police department. And so this is a better utilization of resources.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I have no misgivings about transferring this responsibility over to the to the public works department and that the training sounds more than adequate. So we've had a motion, it's been seconded me. We have a roll call vote please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Come from member station. Career Spencer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next light.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'High valley.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Near as Ashcroft High. That carries 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay. You all can go home or you're home. You can go to bed or do whatever you want. Pat, Liz, hug while.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, it's fine with me. Yeah. Why not? Tuesday. Right. Okay. Going once. Going twice. Tuesday, November the 30th. You don't get to vote. Tuesday, November the 30th, 5:00 start. And remind us again what we're we're going to do the housing element and the general plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that the plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'DNC?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I'm just making sure council tax rate raises. So is that was that you're thinking you can unmute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was nice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, I think it was everything. We did move to item six. I mean, if we wanted to think about some of the things we moved item six and just get them all out of the way. So then we're really moving into Vision Zero on the seventh, which I just think is going to be a big one.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I think we should give lots of time for the housing element in the general plan, myself and not you, and not keep people up to all hours doing it because that's, you know, that's that's also not as accessible as we'd like to be howsoever Harry Spencer thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I agree with just limit it to the housing element and the general plan but I would ask that staff really try to push out to the public that we're starting at 5:00 that day, that we're having a meeting that day on these items because that's unusual, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We know we don't normally meet on that Tuesday. So everything the staff can do to really alert because we're going to have the same problem we had earlier today, people not knowing what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And, Madam Clerk, you want a motion? I mean, you want to vote on this or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be fabulous.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fabulous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can't continue it specifically.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Council member in Knox White is going to make that motion, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I move that. We schedule a special meeting for November 30th at 5 p.m. to hear items currently or that were identified as items seven B and seven C on the current council agenda in that order.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Councilor Harry Spencer, you're going to seconded, aren't you?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your muted. Now. I'm happy the second. Thank you. I thought we had to push it out. Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Let's take a roll call vote, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember de thank. Right or center. I Naxalite. I well, i there is Ashcroft and I'm just laughing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wasn't shaking my head. No, my neck is just stiff. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Bye.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Yes. Okay. So Council, we move now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Man and agenda gets really dogged by the end of a meeting. So we go on to item eight. City Manager Communications. Mr. Levitz.'"
