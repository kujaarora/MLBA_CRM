        "'speaker_0': 'The moratorium, it limits rent increases during the moratorium period to to less than 8% for a certain category of rental units that are defined in the cost of Hopkins Act, which basically means it does not apply to single family homes and condominiums.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Homes that were built or apartments that were built after 1995 than anything that was built before 1995 is an apartment complex. It's not individually personalized. It would apply to and in addition, it it restricts the the ability for a landlord to to give notices and to evict tenants unless there is cause, just cause.'",

And the intent is to have that legislation in front of the council and hopefully adopted before the end of the moratorium period.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the moratorium is in effect. It is a limited moratorium. And I should say that just cause eviction portion applies to all rentals, it does not apply to just a segment of rentals. So more information is available on the city's website.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The ordinance is there. The City Housing Authority is fielding questions and again, city staff is working very hard to bring forward. What we are hopeful is what the council is looking for in response to the community's expressed concerns, and that should be before the council the 1st of January.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Considered directing staff to provide the city council with a report on the feasibility of including Alameda in the service area or the Bay Area Bike Share Program. This referral came from Councilmember Ody and Brody.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for being at such a late hour. I'll try to be brief so we can get out of here. So just as a little bit of background, MTC, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission recently contracted with a company to operate the bike share program and expanded from 700 bicycles to 7000 bicycles are doing this in Oakland, San Francisco'",
        "'speaker_5': ', San Jose, Emeryville and Berkeley. Unfortunately, Alameda is not part of that. I know the MBC was looking to expand it to other cities and I would just like to get the sense of the council to instruct staff that if MTC is still looking to expand this or if they're looking to expand this in the future, you know'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that Alameda make an effort to participate because I think we really are of all of the cities in the Bay Area the most bikeable and you know bike sharing for those that don't know it like city car share where you can pick up a car, you know, take it somewhere and drop it off.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Same thing with bike sharing and get on a bike. I think somebody even mentioned it not at the last meeting, but in the previous meeting. You know, that they can just hop on a bike, you know, ride over to Alameda Point, drop it off, you know, pick up another one later.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I know it's not like the biggest issue facing the council today and this month, but I think it's something that, you know, given our our geography and our topography as being flat and the way all of Alameda loves biking and reducing car emissions, that is something that we consider being a part of in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm a big fan of city bike share programs. When I visit my kids in Washington, D.C., I pack my helmet and I use the city bike share there, and it's really reasonably priced. And I would also love to see allow me to be a part of it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I wondered if this is something we wanted to present to the Transportation Commission, to perhaps even study and put together a proposal for MTC just because they handle those sorts of things. And but I certainly agree with Councilmember Ody that we are a flat city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've got the topography, we are adding more bike lanes all the time. And we constantly are trying to get people out of their cars and onto alternate means of transportation, both to reduce our traffic, to improve their health and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which is our responsibility as elected leaders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I'm just wondering whether this might appropriately reside with the Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think any anything that we do on this matter would clearly end up not end up there, but find their way there and then on to the council. So we would be absolutely sure to include the Transportation Commission on anything we do on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Though, could staff look at and so I don't know how MTC arrived at what cities or if cities had to pay any moneys to participate, could start, look into it and then just maybe report back to us or how would staff propose we go forward on the site and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would definitely want to take a look at how they identified the cities. And also, was there a cost to participating? And if there was, how much and do we think that we could you know, obviously, if there's some monetary implication, we would want to talk to the council about that, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we'll bring it back in and take a look at, you know, we need to analyze the program and how they identified the cities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank member Ody for bringing this to him as a referral. I think that's a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, I think we should certainly take a look at this and as part of the review of it, also make sure to involve outfits that at this point in time rent out bikes in Alameda, of which there might be several.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Particularly one on an offshore onshore island drive near the McDonald's restaurant. So I'm sure it's not an either or situation, but if we just make sure that we work it in, you know, everyone can turn out a winner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And Rudy in the staff report. You know, there were a lot of different, you know, issues like, for example, not taking away parking meters, space, things like that. So a lot of this has to be evaluated. But it would be nice if Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Could be at least at the table and and be one of the possible future sites for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That concludes that item in. Yes. You're good. All right. We're going to move on then.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean.'",
