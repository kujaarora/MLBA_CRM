        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So and I just just I do have some questions. I did send them to staff a little earlier this this afternoon or late evening when I warned them that I would be pulling this. But essentially this for the sake of anybody watching, it's a report on the impact on shallow groundwater and sea level rise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And while I can't find the exact citation that I would love to read, the first page actually has a consultant's mentioning that city should be doing this work and nobody is. And I think we are one of the first cities to actually start looking at this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This issue ended up in our Climate Action Plan because input from our community around whether or not just putting walls up, sea walls up would actually have any impact around our our our soil. And I think for me, it was very interesting to to read through how some of the old contaminated soil issues actually become quite, quite'",
        "'speaker_4': 'significant issues in some surprising places around town, actually earlier than sea level rise starts to impact things. And so, you know, like I said, I just wanted to do a celebrate for our staff, just the huge accomplishment that I think this is.'"

And would you like to give just for the public who's watching? Would you like to give a little overview of this item and then you could address the vice mayor's questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, Mayor. As you Ashcraft and Vice Mayor Knox White members of council. I'm Aaron Smith, the public works director for the city. Thank you for the praise, Vice Mayor. The report has been quite the journey. It was first in the development of the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan around 2018.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There was actually some press coverage from U.C. Berkeley researchers that had started to contemplate and characterize the rising groundwater and the implications with sea level rise. And that came out right during our development with the Climate Action Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was fairly high level regional data that was published, but it definitely sparked good conversation. It was beyond the scope of our climate action or resiliency plan to localize that regional data. But we did put an action item in the Climate Action and Resiliency Plan to further characterize the rising groundwater.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the rising shallow groundwater layer here in Alameda. So we kicked that work off actually with Silver Stream is a the consulting firm that actually worked with the UC Berkeley researchers. And we are lucky enough to the principal of that firm that helped us is actually an Alameda resident, which so I know this this work is very'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Local.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Local information. And the report, as has shown, has a more refined model. It definitely shows flooding, increased extent of flooding. When you contemplate what's called emergent groundwater, that's when the groundwater rises to a point. It's now on the surface.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It increases that extent by 25%, and it may even have flooding from groundwater. Emergent groundwater occur sooner than what we had originally contemplated at Shoreline Overtopping. So it's definitely important information. And our first next next step is to incorporate that into the Climate Action Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I work closely with our consultant here to do a little bit of that legwork. And you can see there's tables at the end of this document that actually are the updates to the tables that need to go into the Climate Action Resiliency Plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So a lot of that work is to some degree done. The next step is really on the implementation front. I think that one of the first steps we will continue to do is is to advocate and collaborate with the regulating agencies that are responsible for groundwater contamination.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They set remediation, corrective action plans that have historically considered a static climate. And so this report is pushing a conversation and that they're wanting and willing to have. It's just very new of how do we consider groundwater contamination when there's possibilities that that groundwater may.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rise with sea level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Rise projections. So continuing to work with them, continuing to install more monitoring wells both geographically and temporally, increasing maybe the rate in which we or the regulators are looking at them. I think there's continued points of collaboration with the educational institutions we have in the Bay Area because I think they're great.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think pushing the conversation as much as we can. One other thing that will that is happening is this study is, you know, one of the first of its kind in the Bay Area and really was instrumental in Sylvester, um, the consultant working with the San Francisco Estuary Institute to win a climate one of the Climate'",

It's a lot of really motivated, smart people going to be looking at this subject matter at a regional level in the hopes of pushing forward solutions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the city has been asked to sit on that technical advisory committee. So we'll definitely be part of any ongoing solution discussions for this matter. If if I can answer any other questions, I'm happy to. I can probably keep talking but don't want to take.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Next slide, please. The purpose and need for this, the sort of the guiding sort of objectives were to improve safety and reduce conflicts between regional and local traffic, enhance bicycle and pedestrian accessibility and connectivity within the area, improve mobility and accessibility for travelers between the freeway, the Webster Posi tubes, the city of Oakland, downtown neighborhoods in the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'city of Alameda, and then reduce freeway bound regional traffic and congestion on local roadways and area neighborhoods. Next slide. It's been a tough, tough project. We have been some of us have been working on this for almost 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's it's a difficult project because you've got an old freeway running through a dense urban area. And we have many stakeholders, obviously, the city of Oakland, the city of Alameda, the Jack London neighborhood, the Chinatown neighborhood, all sorts of interest groups, bike and pedestrian groups, landmark groups.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then, of course, with each year, more and more residents living closer to these interchanges and these on ramps and off ramps, so not an easy task to try to redesign freeway access in an established urban area. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a it's not going to be cheap. The voters approved $75 million for this project if we could figure out a solution. Ictsi has come up with another 6 million or excuse me, another ten or so. We're up to about $86 million of secured funding.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But as you can see in this table, the total project cost is estimated now at close to 120 million. So there is additional funding still needed in the order of approximately $33 million that still need to be secured before we can construct this entire project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next slide, please. It can be done in phases or in in chunks. There's what we call the core project, which we'll show you in a minute. But then there's a number of additional pieces to the project that we'd like that are included in the project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Description. A number of improvements in Chinatown for bike and pedestrian improvements. The Oak Street Cycle track in in Oakland at $6 million. A new walkway through the Webster tube at 7 million. Some improvements on the Alameda side of the of the tubes for bicycle and pedestrian improvements at about a million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So when you add it all up and then the sixth Street improvements in Oakland, another 34 million. So it gets you up there pretty quickly to about $120 million. We'd like to just give everybody a kind of a quick overview of what this project will, how it will change the experience from an Alameda perspective.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just to remind everybody, Alameda is know this this route connecting to the I-80 freeway. What you see here on the slide is the I-80 freeway. The blue line was a26 on it. That's supposed to be Alameda Snow. When you drive out of Alameda, you go through the posey tube.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You come out in Oakland under that freeway. If you're going onto the freeway northbound, you do that sort of right hand turn, another right and then another right sort of past those homes. And you get on the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's you're basically driving through Chinatown to get to the freeway if you're going southbound on 80. So do that right. And then you have to make another right and then make a left on Fifth Street and then head down Fifth Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's a very convoluted approach to getting on to a freeway from a state highway. And you have to circulate through Chinatown if you're coming home to Alameda on the 880 Freeway from the south in particular, or from the north.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what the red lines indicate. And I won't walk you through it. Alameda is know what? It's you know how to do it. It's but essentially what you can see from the red lines as you're winding through Chinatown or you're winding through the Jack London neighborhood to get to the Posey Tube entrance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next slide, please. This is a diagram and it shows as the animation is adding in how the freeway onramp connections are going to be redesigned. We're going to show you in a minute some of the videos that our friends at CTCA prepared, which I think do a better job of illustrating it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But essentially what you see on this diagram is where today you circulate through the core of Chinatown or through the through the main streets of the Jack London District to get on and off the freeway. Now all those movements are brought closer to the main line of the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So you're much you're close to the freeway. We're getting traffic out of the the neighborhoods of Jack London Square and Chinatown. And then the perimeter colors that are on Seventh Street and Oak Street represent bicycle and pedestrian improvements in the Chinatown and Jack London neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next slide. So we've got some videos here which we're playing. This is your trip. You're leaving Alameda, you're coming out through the posi tube and you're heading northbound on AT&T. Normally you would continue straight, but with the new with this adjustment, you can have an off ramp before the freeway and there's what we call the horseshoe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So instead of going around the into Chinatown, you're going to make that sharp, right? You're heading down Fifth Street right now. And then you're making a left and you're essentially on an onramp at this point and you're circling under the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And you're making another left, and then you are on the Jackson Street Onramp. So instead of circulating through Chinatown, you've moved. Now, of course, there'll be more traffic. This is not a representation of the traffic conditions. This is just a representation showing you the new route to get onto the freeway heading northbound.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's go to the next video. You're coming home. Heading from San Francisco, let's say. And you're heading down the. The ramp at Jackson's coming down into the Jack London Square area off the freeway. That's the horseshoe ramp just to your left and how you make.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Another left turn. And another left. Normally you would head over to the Broadway. Intersection. But now what you'll be able to do is just go a few blocks. Along the edge of the freeway. This is along Sixth Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'One more block. You come to Webster Street and you make a left. And you are into the Webster, too. Coming home to Alameda. The Oak Street off ramp to Sixth Street. You've come off the freeway now. And you're heading along the new Six Street Road that is part of this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is as an alternate instead of the long Broadway off street this currently you take the Broadway offramp and it takes you all the way to the Broadway intersection if you're coming from southbound 80, 80. Now you'll drop down and land at Oak Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Go along sixth street. I'm sorry. I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That was actually at Webster.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You could have. Yeah. That was that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Went past Webster.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. I miss, I, I, I misrepresented that one. But let's keep moving. The, the, a number of improvements in the Oakland, Chinatown and Jack London area to improve bicycle and pedestrian safety. This these areas have been significantly impacted over the years by automobile traffic trying to get on and off that freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with this rearrangement of the on ramps and off ramps, you have now the ability to really improve the urban environment in the Jack London and and and Chinatown environment to improve pedestrian bicycle safety. So really great improvement for those users.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a diagram showing the Chinese garden park. As you come out of the posi. Whoa. Going a little too fast as you're coming out of the posi tube. You know, we we have to drive around these two blocks of Oakland to get to the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By removing that movement for freeway traffic. It really provides an opportunity to improve these these two blocks and make it a much more attractive and safe place for pedestrians and bicyclists in Chinatown. Next slide. There's also a couple improvements on the Alameda side to improve bicycle and pedestrian access into the posi tube and out of the Webster'",
        "'speaker_6': 'tube. So the numbers on the right, number three and four are are improvements for bicycle and pedestrian access into the Posey Tube bike path, pedestrian path, and then items one and three and two on the left coming out of the Webster tube.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the improvements to allow for bicycle and pedestrian access through the Webster tube where none exists today. Next slide. And this is a cross section of the two tubes. On the right is the posey tube, where that's the existing condition.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As you can see, the little three foot bike path on the right that's available today for bikes and pedestrians. On the left is a cross section of the Webster Tube, and it shows how this project will open up one of the path in the Webster tube so that now pedestrian bicyclists will have two options between to get'",
        "'speaker_6': 'back and forth between Oakland and Alameda. One, the existing Posey Tube and the new Webster Tube connection. Next slide, please. So as you saw in are the city staff and the draft letter that went to the Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'On this project, the city staffs from the city of Alameda was concerned that this project, although really much needed and much overdue to improve conditions in Oakland, improve the access to the freeway, reduce pedestrian and bicycle safety issues in Oakland didn't really do enough to improve pedestrian and bicycle connections and access between Alameda and Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that is not only to really support bicyclists and pedestrians, which we need to do, but also to reduce traffic in Oakland and Chinatown. So we have been working on a feasibility study with the Oakland Alameda excuse me, the alameda county transportation commission on a bicycle and pedestrian bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This connecting allen west alameda to jack london square. We know this bridge is feasible to build now. We know we can build it to meet the coast guard's navigational requirements, the city, the port of Oakland's navigational and operational requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We know it's an expensive project and we know we have a long way to go. We still have detailed design, environmental work and we have to raise the money to do it. But it has the potential and we know from a demand study that we can reduce up about 5000, you know, that it can add approximately 5000'",
        "'speaker_6': 'trips a day, would use this bicycle and pedestrian bridge if we used it. So that translates into a lot of cars that we could take out of the network if we can get this done. Next slide, please. Oh, this is just real quickly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The the the change in the routing will save time for automobile drivers in alameda. A couple of minutes in the morning. When you leave the posi tube because of the horseshoe, you'll save some time heading southbound on i-80, about 2 to 3 minutes as you head southbound on AT&T because of the fifth Street connection from that new'",
        "'speaker_6': 'exit from the Posey Tube. Next slide, please. Coming from WEBSTER You know, coming from downtown Oakland, it will be more direct. Save a couple of minutes there. For those of you who drive up the A380 freeway from the South Bay because of the removal of the Broadway off ramp and this is where I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sort of miss characterize that video. The Broadway off ramp which is very long you get off the Broadway off ramp and it carries you on that elevated off ramp all the way to Broadway. And then you're forced through the Broadway intersection, which is really a very congested intersection.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And by dropping that ramp and having you drop at Oak Street and come in through the Webster tube, there's a significant, you know, 4 to 6 minute savings. By 2045. It might be as much as 6 to 8 minutes savings because you don't have to circulate through the neighborhoods of Oakland to get to the website or to'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Next slide, please. There's information about this project much more comprehensive than I just presented at the Web site shown here. There's also a public comment period that's going through November 30th on the draft, the air next slide. So we published a draft letter of support with suggestions for key considerations for the city of Alameda regarding the bridge'",
        "'speaker_6': 'regarding Oakland support. We the basic the draft letter that we presented the transportation can commission on October 28th recommended support for the project with with three conditions one or two conditions. One was that Oakland support the project. If Oakland didn't want to do it, then you know our support, then we wouldn't pursue it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if Oakland felt it was important for Oakland, then we would we would stand by Oakland and support the project and that there. The second condition was that there be a commitment towards the next planning steps by the army, the county transportation commission to the bicycle pedestrian bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Transportation Commission made a couple of changes to the letter. They requested that we add a comment about further transit enhancements to improve transit access through the tube system in the next phases of the design process. And we had even offered that we give up the Webster walkway because we didn't feel it was in our draft letter'",
        "'speaker_6': '. We didn't feel that it was very important or would really benefit by pedestrians. And the Transportation Commission felt that, well, we don't give that up so quickly. That's that Webster walkway, although probably not well used in the future, is certainly a slight by adding it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's a it's a net gain for bikes and pedestrians, at least some. So they made those two suggestions. Next slide. Since we drafted that letter, a number of things have happened. The City of Oakland administrator issued a letter in support of the Oakland Alameda Access Project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we now know that Oakland is in support. So we think we should revise the letter. We don't think that needs to be a condition anymore. We've also received a letter yesterday from the Army to County Transportation Commission executive director talking about their support and a willingness to assist us with the next steps in the bicycle pedestrian'",
        "'speaker_6': 'bridge process. So we have transmitted those letters to the council tonight, earlier this afternoon, and we have revised the letter we've revised it to because we don't necessarily need this. The conditions about the Oakland of the Oakland support and we have revised the letter and to continue our support for the project with the understanding that the Army'",
        "'speaker_6': 'County Transportation Commission will continue to support our effort and Oakland is going to continue to support the effort to to build the bicycle pedestrian bridge. And we think ultimately with the Oakland Army Access Project, Oakland Alameda Access Project constructed and the bike bridge constructed, we will have achieved everything that we were trying to do to improve transportation'",
        "'speaker_6': 'connections, achieve significant mode, shift reduce traffic, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and just improve the quality of life both in Oakland and Alameda and in the region. So we have prepared that draft support letter for your consideration tonight and it was distributed to all of you earlier this evening.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that's the last slide. So with that, I'm available myself and Rochelle are able to answer any questions. And I know the County Transportation Commission staff is here as well. Executive Director of van Gelder. Do you want to say anything at this point or do you want to?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, I'm sorry. I'll turn it over to you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you'll see me smiling, waving and laughing because we have some really cute little kids. I mean, it's nice that all your council members are cute, but the little boys on this on this meeting are adorable. So council, I think what I would suggest if you're amenable is that we hear some brief remarks from Miss Mojo'",
        "'speaker_3': ', the executive director of A.C.T., who can also answer any clarifying questions you might have. And then we'll hear your clarifying questions. And actually, you can ask a few questions of any of the numerous staff members who are here this evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then we will go to our of our public speakers. So why don't we start with this CTC director test myself? Do you want to make some remarks? Nice to see you again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, councilmembers. It's nice to see all of you. And thank you for having this item before you tonight. I just want to start off by saying that Alameda City has long supported transportation improvement efforts in the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to note that just since 2016, there have been about $35.6 million that the city that Alameda City has awarded to the city for funding the ferry, terminal trails and several complete streets projects, and specifically for this estuary crossing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Alameda, CTSI has supported $100,000 feasibility study back in 2009, about 275,000 for the 2019 feasibility study. And just this Thursday, the commission is poised to include two acts. They haven't acted yet, but they're poised to include the Westin Project, which is the estuary crossing in our long range countywide transportation plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank you all for working so closely with us and the city of Oakland on this. Oakland, Alameda, accept this project. In the letter that I did submit yesterday and and have had some very good conversations with the mayor, I did indicate to Pathways that my commission, the Alameda CTC, could consider for future funding'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for the estuary crossing bridge. And those are articulated in the letter. And we certainly look forward to working with your staff on how we can help technically to support moving the project forward. So I just want to thank you for your support of allowing me to access project.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have long supported the work of the city of Alameda, and I'm certainly happy to answer any questions that any of you have tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much. Just for clarification, what's coming before the commission this Thursday is to include the Western Crossing in the 2020 county wide transportation plan for the ten year comprehensive investment plan, because there was both the ten year and the 30 year.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we asked that. That's correct. This western crossing be moved from 30 year horizon to ten years. Thank you. And yes, I think your letter lays out the of the other routes that we've we've discussed our with Mr. Chavez and and and John Batters Emeryville Councilmember, who's the vice chair of the Alameda County Transportation Commission and a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'big supporter of our proposal, was also in on this conversation on council clarifying questions about either the staff reporter any of the correspondents before you kill somebody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thanks for that presentation. Quick question, this ten year cap list, I mean, what does that get us? And then I have a follow up. Depending on the answer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Odie, I'll go ahead. Unless city staff, you want to answer that, but I know you're.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The perfect person to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. So Alameda City is one of our responsibilities is to develop the long range county wide transportation plan. That county wide transportation plan feeds into the regional transportation plan. And a project has to be in the regional transportation plan to receive state or federal funds.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For our long range countywide transportation plan. We require that projects that come through our comprehensive investment plan for funding need to be listed in the countywide transportation plan. So it is really a pathway to allow projects to be able to move forward from a funding perspective.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So I guess my follow up would be, I think you kind of answered it and thank you for that answer. I mean, there's no guarantee of funding by moving it from the 30 year plan to the ten year plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. I think that was the kind of the intention of the original two letters was to get some commitment and funding but. I'm not hearing a commitment on funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. This the county, right? Excuse me. The county transportation plan is not a programing document. It's basically a document that enables you to pursue funding. What these normal county long range countywide transportation plans basically compile projects that are of interest and importance to cities, the transit operators throughout Alameda County.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we've done that's different this year is we worked with our city and transit operators to identify what do you really think that you can accomplish in the next ten years in terms of your priorities? And so we we we established this ten year priority list based upon the priorities from our local jurisdictions as this list that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we're really trying to accomplish within the next ten years. And that's based upon project readiness and the ability to be funded. And so we worked with all cities to identify. What they thought would be in the 30 or less, what they thought would be in the ten year list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so your project going before the commission is on the ten year list. There would need to be just a final. Excuse me for interrupting, but a final note is that any funding for the project would have to come as a very specific action to the full commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We as staff obviously are not able to commit any funding, but any funding actions would have to go through the full commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. One last thing and I haven't seen you since you saw your new job, so belated congrats on that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think as long as we're talking about funding this budget and it with reference to at least in my first draft letter, that should still in the second one. But this 2014 letter, that is an exhibit, it's one of the exhibits to this particular staff for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you want to just touch on that and how that may factor in?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, just a little bit of history, which forgive me if you already know all of this, but when.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The public the public is listening in. So you're you're helping with speed. This is great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when the county what when be back in 2014, the Alameda County Transportation Commission developed a county wide transportation plan to go before voters to seek their approval of a half cent transportation sales tax augmentation and extension. And we were going to each of the cities throughout Alameda County to seek their support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There were discussions at that time with the city of Alameda at wanting to make sure that there was enough in that plan that could really support the needs of the city of Alameda. And because, as Andrew Thomas has talked about, this, what used to be called the Broadway Jackson Project had been going on for so long, the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city wanted to make sure that they had some assurances that if the project did not move forward, that there could be funding that could support the multi-modal access that's needed to the city. And so the chair and the vice chair at that time wrote a letter saying that if the project becomes infeasible, then the commission could consider'",
        "'speaker_0': 'programing money to the city. And so in my letter to you yesterday to the mayor, I noted that there are two pathways for the city to pursue funding. One is to go through our application process for discretionary funding, which is called our CIPA Comprehensive Investment Plan, and we're doing a call for projects in December.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The second pathway is to come to the Commission and ask for consideration of that 2014 letter and for any consideration of funding through that venue. So those are two pathways that are before the city to come forward to have the Alameda CTC consider funding for the asteroid project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for the clarification questions council. That's where they suck.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. This is for our staff on the presentation particularly, particularly on page eight, the PDF Page eight. There is a construction phasing, kind of a just in case there's a shortfall. How funding? What kind of priorities would occur?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My question is within Phase A, which is referred to as core project, which amounts to $68.2 million. Is the horseshoe coming out of posi tube? And is the improvements that lead up to evening commuters coming into Webster Tube?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are all of those projects within the core project a $68.2 million?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My understanding is the horseshoe and the the dropping of the Broadway off ramp are both in the core project, and I'm seeing some heads nodding in the affirmative. So I think I'm right about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, wonderful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's my.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Birthday. So I've got it. I've got, I guess, a technical question. And then I want to go back and ask a couple of questions about the funding. The technical question is because I don't think I heard it and I'm sorry if I missed it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Enter in your presentation at one point in time that the Horseshoe was going to result in a slowdown of actual speed limit in the tube. Is that still a part of this project?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I it. Rodney, do you? I see, Rodney said, going up and down. I'm going to ask Rodney if he can help me answer that question. I believe the answer is. I believe the answer is yes. Rodney, am I right about that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, definitely a key consideration because of the the geometry of the horseshoe is that we needed to slow traffic down to 20 miles an hour by the time they reached the first curve. And so in order to do that, we'll be reducing the speed limit in the in the tubes to 35 miles an hour and then a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'thousand feet before the end of the tube will be reducing speeds down to 25 miles an hour, which is a normal city street speed limit. And then 20 miles an hour right at the at the first curve of the horseshoe, this was a big controversy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then also a consensus point with Caltrans was to make sure that the horseshoe was safe. And so reducing the speed limit was a key component of that. So we'll be you know, we'll be looking at adding changeable message signs and other it's elements to help motorists know that they need to slow down by the time they'",
        "'speaker_2': 'negotiate the horseshoe. Also, what we'll be doing is is is narrowing the lanes inside the tubes to 11 feet to to employ traffic, calming measures to try to slow down vehicles as well. So through all these different measures, you know, we'll be trying to slow down cars and then making the the the drive to the horseshoe as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'safe as possible. Right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very helpful. And I guess and I'm not sure who the quite I'll ask you the question, I guess, about funding and perhaps staff is the right one. But so we've been talking in our in our community members have been talking about the need for a real true multimodal access for for for many decades and for many, many'",
        "'speaker_4': 'years on this project. And, you know, I just learned about your you're the new letter about it 20 minutes ago. So before I came into the meeting, not realizing that there was a there was a new revised letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you'll recall that I texted you earlier today, but we weren't able to discuss this item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Would I would have given you a heads up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's unfortunate. So I guess my question is, given that so far, I'm a little concerned that I'm hearing that there are no actual commitments to fund the next steps of this project, that we're going to put it in the CIP so that it can be, you know, available for future funding and but no action.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess. My my concern is no action has been taken on our past kind of requests to try to get here up until this point. And so I guess what from your standpoint with the new letter, what commitments are we getting besides consideration to put it into a sip that will then allow us to someday apply for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'funding? Is there a broader I mean, are you hearing from your members on the committee that they're going to turn around and say, yes, that the money for the PSR in the air is is an easy go?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I don't want to speak too much for my fellow commissioners, but I think it would be safe to say that I have some really good solid support, including from our to Oakland councilmembers. Every city in the county has a council, a representative from the council on the Alameda County Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the city of Oakland, because it is so large, has to. And I certainly spent a fair amount of time talking with my colleagues from Oakland. But others, we have good support on the commission. And so when and again, you know, you never guarantee a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But when I asked at my policy committee meeting last week to move our Western policy project from the 30 year city where it had been assigned to the tenure and explained why this was so important not just to Alameda and Oakland, but also to the region, because it isn't stated in the letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What our ultimate goal really has to be is to reduce the number of automobiles, especially single use automobiles on our roadways. And I am happy to say that my policy committee from across the county and different agencies and county supervisors voted unanimously that they thought that was the right decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and so what I also would say in a conversation this afternoon and this, Michel, if you wanted to just chime in about the next steps, because we are looking at action items both coming up in our well, let's see for our December.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The commission doesn't meet in December as a full board, but in January of 2021, we're looking at a couple of action items. So if you want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you may I could just say at a staff little level excuse me to respond to Commissioner Erskine me councilman or not musselwhite's comment about vice mayor excuse me. Comment or question about a commitment of funding. That has to that is an item that has to go before the full commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is not something that staff is able to provide that commitment, because ultimately we are not the ones that are assigned the full responsibility for programing and allocating the Measure B funds. So what we're looking at is if we get a letter from from the city regarding the interest to have the Commission take a look at'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the 2014 letter and consider that I commit that we can bring that to the first meetings in January. We have one commission meeting in December. It's on December 3rd, and they don't we don't have committee meetings for that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the first realistic time with this could come forward if we received that request from the city would be in January. And the first committee meetings that we have in January are on January 11th. So if that's the case, then we'd certainly want to set up times to meet with the city and talk with the city about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'approaches moving forward with this. And so the moment I get that letter, I'm ready to to set up some meetings. I'd like to set up some meetings with the mayor and and with with staff. I'm imagining Andrew Thomas would be there and perhaps whoever else from the city is appropriate, maybe Michel as well, to have a chance'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to sit with my staff and to come up with an approach for how we bring this to the commission in January for consideration. The other thing I wanted to note is the CIP, which is our competitive call for projects, will be released and opened in December, and that's another opportunity for the city to pursue discretionary funding for'",
        "'speaker_0': 'bicycle and pedestrian facilities through our comprehensive investment plan. So I laid out two pathways for the city to be able to pursue funds, and those are both available to the city. But ultimately it's the commission as an entire commission that would need to act on any sort of programing, funding and programing action.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Dillon and Vice Mayor, just to go back to your question, I don't recall that and someone can correct me if I'm wrong that we have actually brought forth a proposal other than the funding we've gotten thus far, and we have gotten funding for early in the early phases of this bridge design and study, but'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there hasn't been anything since then that we've asked for and been turned down by actually bringing it to the commission. This letter, the draft letter is is a letter and it serves different purposes. But to actually get the technical funding there, to actually get the funding commitments, we do need to go to the full commission and it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'would first come through our policy committee, says Ms.. Fischel noted. And then the other thing I'll say is we all agree that we do need to work really carefully or not carefully, but just deliberately on communication, because we realized in in finally having a chance to sit down with the executive director, with the Vice Chair of the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'commission and some of our staff, that that is what you see. Staff wasn't aware of the extent to which we have engaged with the Coast Guard and that and I guess I'm just privileged to work with such smart, knowledgeable, talented people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Andrew Thomas, Michelle Wheeler, Rodney Pimentel has been awesome and he speaks that language. So he has been able to work. I think he's been doing this with the Coast Guard a year or more, maybe to make sure that the bridge design standards were compliant with the Coast Guard standards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so but DC wasn't aware of the extent of that. And we are expecting a letter from the Coast Guard soon, tomorrow. So anyway, I that's a that's a really long winded answer to your question, but I think that there is, as Ms..'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Michelle said, there is a path forward to getting funding. And I do feel that we have good support from the Commission. Did I get through the questions before I got to Councilmember. Councilmember Vela. I see.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And my my question is really, you know, is, are the policy committees or we just went through the process, but is there going to be or are we hopeful that there will be a recommendation of support?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do you do those committees from those committees? Is that what I'm reading into this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would say yes. Did you want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hear a thank you, Mayor? Yes. The way that the committees work at Alameda City is that they are recommending committees are subcommittees of the full board. The board is made up of 22 elected officials in Alameda County and the committees hear items and then they make recommendations to the full commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so essentially for it to go to the full commission after going from the committees, it would be going with some sort of recommendation, correct? Yes. Just to spell it out for members of the Bloc.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, exactly. And and you can be sure that I'm lobbying my committee and and we all stay in touch. I mean, these are the representatives of our 14 cities, all of our county supervisors and then the representatives of our transit agencies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Any further clarifying questions, Kels, over this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a quick. Question for staff need to check. So when the traffic comes out of the posi tube, can we still go up to the Chinese garden park and then make a left there on that seventh street?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I forgot. Or a street. And can we make it? Can we make a left like we do now? Granted, it won't be. It'll be at a at a. Angle. It won't be that nice. Smooth left. Can we still make a left?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Left and then? And then onto Jackson. Figure out a way to then get on to the. In other words, not take the do not take the horseshoe. If that's still an option, even if we have to do a hard left.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hard left.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's all right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hard right? Yeah, exactly. Sorry about that. Hard right. Hard right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. That will still be an option. It just won't be as big as you said because of the changes to improve bicycle pedestrian access. It won't be as as as as fast as it might have been in the past.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mm hmm. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Okay. Any. I can't. Everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I'm just. I mean, without commenting on the substance, because that'll be for later. But I'm just curious on the process because, you know, we had a letter that I first read about in the newspaper, and then it went to the Transportation Commission where there was a public hearing and they made modifications to it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then it was agenda is on this agenda with a chance for the council to review and then an hour and a half before the meeting without any council input and apparently some discussions that none of us were party to or didn't even know were going on happened.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then now we have another revised letter that the public hasn't received. So, I mean, maybe I'm missing something in the process, but it seems to me that, again, that I don't want to talk about, you know, what the letter has in it, but it just seems to be like a nontransparent process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can we can someone kind of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Walk me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Through, you know, what conversations were had and what promises were made? You know, how we got to a point where the verbiage was changed and I mean, it just I'm a little bit baffled.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I will be happy to take that, because Andrew Thomas asked me, do you want to just go forward with the letter that's out there and have everybody kind of wordsmith it tonight? And I said, what I would rather do is get the letter into the council packet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it did go in. But you have to know and refresh your your packet and all that that because I wanted the public to see it, to be able to follow along in real time, I wanted the council to be able to see it and the the changes that came about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it wasn't a matter of trying to not be transparent because that's not my style. But we got an urgent request yesterday morning that, you know, there's some some serious concerns about a couple of things in this letter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of them was that we seem to be asking the commission to to guarantee funding, which is, as Ms.. Michelle explained, is not the way that process works. And we were also suggesting that now maybe County Transportation Commission be the lead the lead agency on this on the estuary crossing project for a number of reasons, because'",
        "'speaker_3': 'there's also federal approvals that have to take place. That was not necessarily something that could be done, but it just it wasn't the best place to state that. And we already had gotten and Mr. Thomas was able to get the support from the city of Oakland by way of this letter from the city administrator.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we didn't need to have that in there as a condition. I mean, we could have just probably done all the wordsmithing now and in a sense we will be. But I wanted to get the letters out into the packet for the Council and the rest of the public, and I'm sorry that some of you didn't see'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it sooner, but that's that's what it is. And that was why I earlier alluded to that, that we have discovered that we need to do more and better communication, because it would definitely have been preferable. When my draft letter first came out and got picked up by blogs and on the, you know, on the front page of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'one of our local newspapers, and it caused a lot of consternation. And I wasn't sure that everybody had actually read the whole thing, but there were some technical points, the ones that I pointed out, that did need to be corrected for it to be a more accurate letter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I guess my concern was, I mean, I got the email from Laura with the attachments, so I was able to read it before and without getting into the merits of the changes, I mean, whether they're valid concerns raised yesterday or not, I mean, I think those are concerns that should have come to the Council for a policy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'decision and not just unilaterally had a change in the letter, because many people in the community have raised a lot of. Concerns and correspondence to us. And I mean, personally, I think it should be our our position and our role to evaluate those concerns that I'm sure the seven people or more are going to raise and, you'",
        "'speaker_1': 'know, come to a decision together. You know, again, I'll have my comments on the substance later. But, you know, I, I just the process on this. I'm not I'm just not sure it is follows that this letter in the spirit of our sunshine ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well we certainly could have then I guess agenda is this for a continued it to another time and taken a little more time. I'm kind of playing Beat the Clock because I really would like to get this back to the County Transportation Commission in time for the December Policy Committee meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the January full commission meeting that we are going to have we are going to have a discussion after we've heard our public comment. And I appreciate hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, it's just, you know, there's five of us here and we all should have it have a say in that. That's my only point. And I think we're perfectly capable of doing that in meeting the November 30th deadline with this agenda item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Thank you. Any further comments? Okay. Let's go to public comment then. And so how many public speakers do we have now?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We now have 12.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So and each speaker will then get 2 minutes and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're now up to 15. Okay. So more people are seven. First one is Michael Mooney.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm just going to say really quickly that the speakers, you know, you certainly can have your 2 minutes, but you should not feel the need to repeat exactly what the previous speaker said. But with that, we are happy to hear our first comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Mr. Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor and city council members, I will make this quick. I am a past president of OCA East Bay, so we work a lot with Oakland, Chinatown, and I'm also a 40 year Alameda resident, so I've been here for a while, grew up here in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm talking to you guys about this as an Alameda resident. This is something. Okay. And I think this is a great project on my in support of the project. I think it's definitely after hearing everything that's been going on, you know, being in Alameda and being in Alameda for so long, it is something that is definitely overdue'",
        "'speaker_1': '. You know, we're not living like we were 40 years ago where you could actually have where the tunnel is and kind of be able to go through it and be on the freeway and be in San Francisco in like 15 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't do that anymore. So any time saved, any time going around makes it a lot easier. Plus, also working in Chinatown and doing to Oakland, Chinatown, Pick It Up program. We see a lot of the trash and a lot of the pollution and all the other stuff that goes along on the walls.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so we feel, you know, I think that that would definitely help out in Oakland, Chinatown site. So excuse me, I'm sick. So but I just wanted to let you know that I'm in support of this. And also if we we do start doing the the the bridge, I think we should also think about motorized skateboards or'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one wheel ease or, you know, put. Personal vehicles are personal motorized devices that are electronic or electric to be able to go through the bridge area. Sorry about that. I'm still sick. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. Man.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope you feel better soon. All right. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Sabrina Chen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Chen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have to unmute which I needed. People don't appreciate, but. But here I am. Good evening. My name is Sabrina Chen. I've lived here for 23 years, and prior to that, I spent over two decades helping build the social service infrastructure in Oakland, Chinatown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the reason why we have Asian health services, the Culture Center and all these other things, I, I was I'm very proud to say I had a little hand in it or a fist or something. But to to see Chinatown in the past 11 years has been devastating for me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'With all of the protests that overflowed into Chinatown, businesses had to close early on weekends and evenings. And, you know, with the with the pandemic and all of the anti-Asian sentiment, it's really suffered a great deal and it's suffered it's been suffering ever since it was established.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the freeway itself destroyed 2000 units of housing, and almost all of the residential in the original Oakland, Chinatown have been destroyed. So when I saw this project, I was really excited to see that traffic would no longer cut right through Chinatown, where we live, our lovely Alameda with the beautiful streets and the trees one mile through'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the tube. And then you see this, this trash in Chinatown. So I really wanted to see this project go forward. And I'm I'm actually glad the letter was changed. And I will harness all forces to support the bridge, the pedestrian bridge, because it will help all of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You're. You're muted, mayor now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm still learning. Thank you, Miss Chen. And I hope Miss Chen read in a very moving letter to, I think it was the whole council. I hope everyone got that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, I think they did.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good. Okay. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doris G.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. G. And we should go ahead and mute. There you go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. Good evening. Here is the Ashcraft vice mayor Knox White City Council staff and a city commission. My name is Doris G. And I live in the city of Alameda. I'm an active community member in the city of Alameda and in Oakland, Chinatown.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been a commuter from the Alameda Tube to my job on Oakland's Pill Hill for more than 35 years. I'm glad the problem is being addressed now with forethought because the traffic can only get worse. I watched the Oakland Alameda Access Project video, which was shown tonight no less than ten times because this is a very complicated'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plan with lots of moving parts and I appreciate all the changes that will happen. One of the treasures in Oakland.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Chinatown, is the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Chinese Garden Park that is underutilized due to traffic. Our family had to cross Seventh and Harrison to visit the Chinese Garden Park. Even with the light, there was a lot of traffic and we were not sure that cars would stop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I cannot imagine anyone who was a senior with disabilities having to negotiate that crossing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With more traffic surrounding the garden park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It makes it very difficult. The park is isolated from the rest of Chinatown due to so much traffic separating it from the community. Removing the Broadway offramp from the 880 North will hopefully create more tourist opportunities and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A symbiotic relationship between.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jack London and Chinatown businesses. My favorite change is thinking.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Outside the box by creating Alameda only exit out of the Alameda Tube to ease traffic.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Getting onto the freeway exchanges. Although the not perfect conditions for biking through the Alameda Tube, I think it's time for us to move forward with this project. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Mr. Next Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Susie Hofstetter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The evening. We have dinner that evening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mayor and Council. My name is Susie Hofstetter. I'm advocacy manager with East Bay. Firstly, I want to thank staff, counsel and all the consultant teams and staff, all me, the city for your hard work on this project over many years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to say that it does support the project specifically for its safety benefits to Oakland, Chinatown, and we stand in solidarity with the Oakland Chinatown community and their needs for justice and in this traffic safety condition. However, we still have serious concerns about the failure of this project to provide true multimodal access across the estuary.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've heard a lot of discussion about this this evening. And when we talk about the future of the bicycle pedestrian bridge. The question for both staff of the city and for the CDC and elected officials is what if the bike ped bridge does not secure any additional funding through the city or from the commission?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In January and the Oakland Limited Access Project continues to move forward with no meaningful multimodal access across the estuary. If this occurs, what is the implication here for the city's commitment to multimodal projects as promised to voters? So we fully understand that our city staff can't commit funding for a separate project without support from the Commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we do need to see is support and commitment from leadership, staff, leadership to partner with the city to present this project in a way to the commission that will earn that success and that will show true partnership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if it's if it's totally neutral and it's just the city asking for this support from the full commission will be very difficult position for us. So that's what we're hoping for, to see true commitment and a presentation that presents the purpose and the need, the way that you would for a project of regional significance for any'",
        "'speaker_0': 'other mode. So that's what I'd like to ask for now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Next Speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denise Champion, you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Evening, Mr. Penny.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Thank you. I appreciate the time and your attention. Mayor, vice mayor and council members and staff. I guess I want to start off by, first of all, thanking staff for their work on this. I was. I'll admit I was a little taken aback by the change in the letter today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had worked very hard with staff on the original draft, so I apologize if I'm sounding a little flustered tonight. But my main the main point I want to make is that the the critical point of staff's original letter was that it conditioned our support on unidentified committing funded sources for the next two phases of the bridge'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I'm just really concerned that we're settling essentially for supporting this project in exchange for a promise that this is going to be added to the ten year plan. But with really, as soon as you just said no committed, identified funding, I'm also a little surprised to hear that people think that this is a new ask.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have been saying since day one that opening up the Webster tube path will not make this project multimodal. And so we were excited that staff was. Basically kind of holding the line on this project, being multimodal and requesting funding to study a true multimodal solution.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, I mean, I'm just concerned this is our one chance to really hold a city six feet to the fire in terms of delivering a multimodal solution, which is what the voters wanted. So I think we have a responsibility to deliver what the voters said they wanted and not not give away that funding for another car project'",
        "'speaker_0': 'without any commitment to any type of multimodal solution for for all meetings. So anyway, thank you for your time and thanks for the work everyone's done on this. I know things have been really fast and I appreciate everyone's attention.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Premier. And next Speaker Cierto Tolani. Good evening. And you just need to unmute.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Good evening. Can you hear me?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Good evening, Mayor. And. And Council members. My name is Sue Gilani. I'm representing Oakland, Chinatown Chamber. I'm a board member and also past president. Interestingly, I also resident, Alameda resident, 20 years living in Alameda. So I live alameda and work for Oakland, Chinatown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I also work in Oakland. Chinatown is my community and for many, many years, Chinatown has been taking the brunt of the Alameda traffic. And and I think the speaker earlier talk about a Chinese garden it wasn't belonged in a community but unfortunately cannot be used by our residents because of the unsafe condition and the the senior resident'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and the kids. So this project came along and I was involved.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I was heavily involved in that and we were supporting the project and we still support this project. So we hope the city of Alameda will approve this project because it's good not only for Oakland, Chinatown, but also it's good for City of Alameda in particular.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With all the development that we have in the Alameda points with many cars, that is going to be coming. So my goal is that I'm hoping.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Project will alleviate some of the traffic issues that our community is facing and it makes some improvement. And and it's really a benefit to our community. And we asked the mayor and council to approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Lundy. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Indeed, Johnson.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is Johnson. It needed me again.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Evening. Good evening, Mayor Ashcraft. Council members and staff. I'm a longtime resident of Alameda, a board member of Bike Walk Alameda, and someone who travels this project area frequently to my job in Oakland. I support the city's recommendation on outcomes described in its original letter or a version of the letter posted just tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If it can be refined further to ensure funding promised will be funding delivered. Life is a good project, but we really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Need to the project to fulfill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Its multimodal promise to users, bikers and walkers who have been woefully.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'The walkway, isn't it? It advancing a transformational.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Project like the bike and pedestrian bridge is the city's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Revised.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Letter seems like the right direction in identifying this issue and steering the bridge into the countywide plan in its ten year priority project priority list. And we celebrate that. That progress now seems dependent on votes and applications that may be denied.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Having to go through the CIP process to compete with other projects for funding feels like a step backwards from where we are now going. To the full commission with the 2014 letter, with letters of recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Proposed, seems somewhat more promising, but still iffy. Bottom line, we'd like to see the cities led refined further.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So funding is committed with greater certainty. Transportation funding is extremely competitive, and we already voted for this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The money that's needed for the next set of studies is sitting in the Webster Tube walkway, which is a truly modern enhancement anyway. Alamy this partnership on Iraq deserves at least this kind of commitment from AC DC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you for your negative.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The city leadership and staff for their hard work on this. It's a really important project and it can be transformational for both of our both sides of the story and for the larger region. Really appreciate it. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Zack BOLLING.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the Mr. BOLLING.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I wanted to throw my support behind the original draft of the letter. I think I agree with the comments from the earlier speakers that we should probably consider conditioning our support on having commitment to a pedestrian bridge.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think there was two online petitions and one of them I think was like over 550 people. The other one had an almost 1500 people from our community that were behind having a pedestrian bridge. I think this project is really vital and we should move forward as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we really do need a better solution for pedestrian and bike access to the across the estuary than that small sidewalk. Is anyone that's ever taken that sidewalk through the tube as it is today is a terrible experience and not something we can consider a viable option.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I will leave it at that. Thank you.'",

We've known about this for two decades at least, that we could have done something about the fact that we're still talking about how to make it easier for people to drive cars.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of the largest contributors to the climate crisis, that is unconscionable. The project is not yet fully funded, and any fundraising with the aim of making it easier to drive is akin to climate denial. It is denying warnings from scientists that cars are one of the region's most significant contributors to the climate crisis.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Bicyclists approach the walkers from the front, and it's easy to see the walker get the walkers attention and to negotiate passing when going the same direction, which would be 100% of the time on a one way path. The bicyclists are approaching the walkers from the back.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People often wear headphones due to the noise and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It can be very difficult to get the walkers attention. Many times I've scared walkers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trying to make them aware that I'm behind them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the video we saw earlier, you'll see multiple bicyclists and walkers together on the path. So next time you watch it, focus on the walkers and bikers. It really illustrates how the bicyclists are going to have to have multiple conflicts as they approach each walker from behind.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I expect that the walkers will start.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Continually looking over their shoulders, worried that some devices will come behind them, so it'll make a bad experience for them also. The goal of these improvements is to increase the number of people biking and walking through the tubes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And although it's unlikely if it did happen, this will just increase these conflicts. I feel that it'd be unfortunate to spend any valuable bike and pedestrian funds on the second path in a tube. This is definitely not a multimodal little project like it's supposed to be.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I strongly support increase in investing funds.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On a real solution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your comments, Mr. Sullivan. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doug Letterman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Letterman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mayor. Council member. Staff. I mean, I'll meet a resident driver and also I ride a bike. I believe this project is designed almost exclusively for drivers of private automobiles, which is fine, but let's not pretend that it does anything for multimodal access or long term sustainability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The bike and pedestrian components of the plan are laughable and provided purely as a stop. On the Oakland side, it simply trades one dangerous traffic sewer for another. While it will reduce some pedestrian conflicts for freeway bound Alameda drivers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It will widen the street off ramp in order to funnel more open bound drivers onto Chinatown streets. The project will do nothing to further the city's goals at reducing automobile trips, greenhouse gas emissions and traffic, the more likely exacerbate them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I believe Alameda has a tremendous opportunity to be a world leader in ending car dependance by encouraging more bicycle transit and pedestrian trips. The estuary bike pedestrian bridge is essential to this goal, and like several other speakers, I would urge Council to get its support for this bloated highway project on a firm commitment to fund the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'estuary, bike and pedestrian bridge. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Letterman. Next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Dave Campbell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Mr. Campbell.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Dave Campbell, Advocacy Director with Vikings. Faye, I just want to add and I apologize missed the presentation was on another call. To the comments that have been made and particularly the comments of Susie Hofstetter from Viki say is that I just want to see Alameda, CTSI commit to funding this bridge, this bike, that bridge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I haven't really had a chance to talk with Alameda City staff on the particulars of this one. But, you know, we have not heard clarity on can money from the OJP this project go to fund the studies, the air, the bike Ted Bridge I have heard yes I for no I don't think I have clarity and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've talked to so many people about this. I know Alameda City staff is on this call. Let's get clarity tonight. Can it happen? And if so, then your letters should say we support the project with the understanding that this bike Ted Bridge will be funded from the project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if not, or maybe you put it the other way, you will. Alameda will apply for the CIP funding to fund the air to the bike bridge. We support this project with the understanding will apply for that money and if we get it great and if we don't, it is our understanding that the OJP project will fund'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this bike pit bridge. So that's all we want. I know Alameda County has the money. We fought hard with volunteers to get Measure B passed. I've seen Alameda and CTSI work out solutions for good projects and find the money.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think what would bring all the parties together tonight? It would be to hear from alameda staff tonight. We are going to build you a bike. Ted bridge, if it's the last thing we do. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was our last speaker.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Okay. With that, I'm going to close public comment and I want to ask for some staff clarifications and a couple of things in broad strokes to Andrew Thomas. Can I ask you to address some of what we've heard from our speakers about urging the City Council to condition their support for the Oakland Alameda Access Project on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'getting funding for our estuary crossing? Could you take that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The we we prepared a first draft letter that many people referred to which conditioned our support on getting funding. And let's just make sure everybody understands. We never conditioned it on funding to build the bridge. We believe that building the bridge is a $200 million effort.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We just were conditioning it on the next studies at about 5 million. So the bridge is a big effort. It's a huge project. It is a project that is going to require a huge lift from the entire region over many years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Long road that we're that we are going to need to go down to get this bridge built and we're going to need regional support. Our first letter served a excellent purpose from our perspective, staff's perspective. It brought regional attention to this project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For the first time in many years, we were hearing from representatives from Oakland, from Emeryville, from Albany. People who represent their cities at the ACT board expressing their.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Support for what we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were trying to do. That is a major step forward because we're going to need their support for many years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From our perspective, we see two good projects here. We see the Oakland Alameda Access Project, and we see that as a good project for the reasons we talked about in the presentation. It is taking care of long standing problems in the Oakland and Chinatown area that were caused by the current design.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We think that we've come up with a great solution to solve those problems and make life safer and better in the Oakland, Chinatown area. Does it solve the bicycle pedestrian access issues crossing the estuary? No, not by a long shot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are letter continues to make that statement loud and clear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A quick.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Side note. Our first letter said, you know, and we don't care about that bike walkway at all. Like, if you want to take that money, that 7 million to put in that walkway and use that to fund the next step in the planning process, which we believe is around 5 to $6 million.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're okay with that. Just take that and fund the next step with that. That would be a simple solution to fixing this problem and getting us to the next step. It was the Alameda Transportation Commission who said, don't give that away so quick.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'STAFF We think it is a net gain. But just for the councils, from the council's perspective, that that's really something that as a policy call for you to make. So we have two projects, two good projects, one that solves problems in the Oakland Chinatown area that we think is super important.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have a second great project that we also need there in different stages of their development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Neither of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Them, though, are at the finish.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Line.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Oakland Alameda Access Project is still short $33 million. The bike, pedestrian bridge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Short 200.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Plus million dollars. The region is going to have to work together to get both of them built. And at this point in this process, holding the first one back. Until and unless we get the. 5 million to do the next step for the second project just didn't seem like the right regional strategy for Alameda to take was'",
        "'speaker_6': 'there. That's why the tone and the change in the letter which says we support the Oakland Alameda Access Project, we think it's a good project and we're doing it with the understanding because we believe it's good for the region.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we're doing it with the understanding the region supports us and is going to continue to support the city of Alameda on this second regional project. And that Alameda County, the Alameda County Transportation Commission, will continue to support both projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is our support and it's it's an and that and we and that is our statement of support for the Open Access project. And it's it's based on this understanding that the region also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Supports the bike bridge.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that's sort of how we see it and we don't see it in in our best interest. And if you're interested in continuing regional support. We're going to need to raise over $200 million over the upcoming years, you know, sort of obstructing or trying to slow down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or or.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hold the one project back until this project, you know, tying them together seemed like we may be taking the wrong the wrong strategy there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Thomas. And then I also wanted some clarification, and I think this would be from you, Mr. Joe. We heard Mr. Campbell of the Bicycle Coalition talking about why can't we use AP money to fund? And by the way, I'm just going to stop here for a minute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I see my time clock is running out. I am trying to see that questions are answered that were raised by our speakers. And I, I don't think I mean, will we get to council discussion? I will happily start counting my time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if I'm going to give up all my time running this meeting, we're going to be taking a lot of roll call votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So are you asking for 9 minutes?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I'm asking why when I'm trying to get clarification questions answered. Sorry, I'm a little irritated a bit, but really? City attorney, city clerk. Help me out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, after the last meeting, the city attorney and I discussed it. You know, he can weigh in, too, but basically, you know, the rules don't provide for a distinction, you know, as part of the staff presentation. And it came up under the council referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the thing was the council member presenting the referral is able to give a presentation and we decided to respond to questions as part of just a referral. But this is a staff brought item and there's no exception for this, we felt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, you know, I guess I could just turn to staff and say you were listening to all the questions that were asked. Would you please answer them? But this. Okay. Okay. I would like to ask that I be given a reset on my clock because I haven't even begun to discuss this with the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we need to do that by motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's why I move that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have a motion by Councilmember de SAC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. We have a statement by the vice mayor. May we have a roll call? Vote, please. Madam Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember de Knox White. Hi, Odie. I avella high mayor as Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that council. I appreciate that. Okay. I'm going to be very brief then. Next question. Answered Please by this one shell can Oakland Alameda Access Project Funding be used for the Estuary Crossing Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So one of the options that I provided in my letter to you, Mayor, yesterday, and I'm not sure if that made it to the rest of the council, but there are two pathways. There's the CHP and then there is this model.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could you start with the threshold question? Yes, that money that's allocated for the Open Alameda Access Project. Can that be allocated to the estuary crossing bridge?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is something that has to be determined at the Alameda CTC for commission. That's not something that is staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like it possibly can be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it possibly could be, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in my letter that I mentioned, I was mentioning the two options that the city could move forward with. And in my second option, it was to bring forth the 2014 letter for consideration at Alameda CTC for funding for the they could consider funding for the estuary bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What I committed in that letter also was that if I received a letter from the city of Alameda in early December, that I could commit to bringing that in January to my commission.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. And you did see that earlier. And so to be clear, the many we are talking about, as referenced in that letter is 75 million, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The money that is in the expenditure plan and referenced in the letter is 75 million. The letter also noted that if the project became infeasible, then the commission would consider reallocation. So I think that that's going to be part of the discussion that is going to need to be addressed at the commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that there is a strong commitment to multi-modal access and improvements. And I think that the Commission I would expect the Commission to be very open to that for considering multimodal access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is there any geographical limitation that comes into play?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The environmental documents for the Oakland Alameda Access Project does not have the estuary crossing as part of its very specific project study area. The expenditure plan in and of itself, the 2014 expenditure plan did not have a very specific delineation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was the formerly known the Broadway Jackson Project. But so that's the distinction that the transportation expenditure plan does not have a map specifically drawn for this project, whereas the environmental document for the Oakland Alameda Access Project does have a very specific delineation of the project for sequence study purposes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But with that intact funding. Andrew Thomas is shaking his head now. Do you want to chime in, Mr. Thomas?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, what the air delineates as the project area doesn't. I mean, the the air can't cover the bridge. That's clear.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Um, I'm.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Let's open it up to council discussion. Who wants to start?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pressman okay. At first I was going to ask if Tony was okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm fine. My carriages went down and you didn't move.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Your chair fell or, you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Know, my camera fell away. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, sir, thank you. I'm going to I'm going to try to talk really quickly and I'm going to. Sorry. I'm sorry that I mean, of course, some folks is probably a little bit of history about this project that, you know, the history of this project is really the history of Alameda and Alameda staff in Alameda as commission'",
        "'speaker_4': 'members and counsel, really pushing this project forward and getting it to the place where we finally have Chinatown by and and coming to us and asking us to please support this. The horseshoe that was discussed was something that was raised by the Transportation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Remember Robert McFarlane McFarland when this project first came before the Alligator Transportation Commission and he read it and he said, Why don't you look at our horseshoe? That's what we do. When we built freeways down in Texas for a number of years, the Transportation Commission in the City Council actually pushed our public works department to keep that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'option alive, as the project managers for this project continued to try to push it off because it was too difficult in getting Caltrans to say it would work. What's not possible? One of the voices who kept saying No, you can do this is now the project manager, Rodney Pimentel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So again, I just want to give some props, props there because really at the end of the day it is the horseshoe that makes this project even possibly worth consideration for me. I think this is a this is a difficult decision we have tonight only in that I do not believe we are delivering the project that the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'voters were presented with when we went to the voters. This is not across estuary Alameda Point Serving Multimodal Project. However, I do also agree with all of our our speakers from Alameda but who also have strong connections into Chinatown that the situation that's happening in Chinatown is just absolutely unacceptable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we are it is our traffic that is impacting their community and we need to do something. So quite honestly, I came to this meeting with fully expecting to support the original letter because I believe that the original letter actually outlines a pathway for meeting not just the letter of doing a project, but also the spirit of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what was presented to people from from the get go. I ask the question a little bit. I'm I guess if I have disappointment, it's that here we are at a meeting where we're being asked to now start a process for asking for funding for hours and hours when we have known for years that this was going to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'be needed and that the city had a strong connection between estuary crossing and the AP. And I'm not I'm quite honestly had a little bit of a loss for why we haven't been working. Why why this? Why, why?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This recommendation didn't happen a year ago, and we didn't actually have hadn't already made some of these questions so that we can actually come in here and say, hey, we've already got the requirement to me. Well, you know, I also believe that we have good faith partners who are here advising us in good faith.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I want to I want to suggest or ask I guess it would be the question. I think one of our first speakers, Steve Hofstetter, made a suggestion. You know, I appreciate Ms.. Langella's commitment to accepting and moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anything but my my ask would be that actually I would want to see staff to actually make a recommendation, along with the city council, with the city of Alameda for this funding. I again, I understand that the staff cannot make a commitment to fund it, that that is on the on the commission, and that's a vote that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'happens. But I think it's I think it is a show of good faith that we understand that this is a priority and this is something that we have been talking about for many, many, many years. I mean, I can tell you about meetings I had at Asian Health Services back before 2010, talking about the need to link'",
        "'speaker_4': 'multimodal connections to reduce traffic through Chinatown. Back when we were trying to convince them that this project was even worth worth moving forward with. So for me, I'd like to see I'd like to add with that commitment, I could actually, you know, I would be happy to sign on to the new and improved letter, but I would'",
        "'speaker_4': 'like to have that commitment. And if not, then I think we need to have a little bit of a conversation about how what what are we going to do if the commission says, well, we don't really want to kind of honor those parts of the those commitments that we made to voters back in 2008.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'll stop right there. I look forward to your. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vella.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you know, I don't want to waste time repeating what the vice mayor as points were. But I think that to me, there's there's a few things here. I've heard from a lot of different community members with different viewpoints.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I certainly think that we need to address Alameda Traffic's impacts to Oakland, Chinatown. And I think that that's a huge issue. And I think the fact that there is buy in from the Chinatown community as well as improvements to the project, is something that I am happy to, to see and to support.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That said, I think my concern is this is all somewhat of a negotiation. And with supporting this project, we ultimately are losing our leverage to support what is deemed a separate project, or at least that's how it's feeling, I think, to some of our bike and multimodal transit advocates in that we are we are distinguishing the projects'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and we are then losing our ability to move forward with the other project. And I know that both are behind on and need more funding. I would echo device mayors asked to get a commitment from the staff to actually recommend support for the next step in the Alameda Estuary Crossing Bike PED Bridge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know we heard from a number of different speakers. I live on the West End. I go through the tube all the time for work. So does my partner. I lived in London. I biked and walked while I was there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The entire time I was there. Going through the tube is on bike is the worst experience I can possibly think of as a cyclist and as a parent to say that this we're going to build another walkway and don't worry you have bike ped access into Oakland from west Alameda is a complete farce because there is no'",
        "'speaker_0': 'way I think I think most parents would look at that and say there's no way I would want my kid going through there with the air quality issues that exist as well as the noise, the noise level going through the tube.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't think we talk about it enough, but it is it is deafening in there. And just I just don't see that as a real feasible crossing. And so I, I think it is important for Alameda to talk about these things, because what we're talking about really is equitable access on the west end of Alameda across the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'estuary for people that that travel in in a number of different ways. And not everybody has the ability to have and afford a single occupancy vehicle. We do have a lot of people that really need this crossing. And so if there's anything that staff from Ictsi leave here with tonight, it's that I want you to really hear'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the council saying unequivocally that this is a priority for us. This West End estuary crossing bike PED access is a priority. And I want to speak for myself and just tell you that it is one of my top and utmost priorities.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Housing is certainly up there at the top of my list, but this is an equity issue. It's an environmental issue, and it's an absolute priority. And to me, this is a non-negotiable thing. And I think we need to all of us regionally find a way forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think and I've heard I also want to put out there, I've heard from Oakland's appointee to the commission. I know she spoke at length with Mayor Ashcraft and I've heard from her her commitments. I think what we're looking for and members of the public are really looking for is more than just a pat on the back'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Be good player. Trust us. This will this will go through. And I think just the timing of this and how the conversations took place and the fact that we are up against a deadline, I appreciate that there's these bureaucratic deadlines that exist and we have to work around them and go with the flow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appreciate our mayor for having these conversations and for bringing everyone here tonight to to sunshine it and to have the have the discussion publicly. But I think what what some of our advocates and activists are looking for is really something in writing that's going to be firmer than, hey, don't worry, you're going to get a fair'",
        "'speaker_0': 'shot at competing for these funds. And I think that that's their concern and I share that concern. So, yeah, so I think getting something a little more concrete about at least supporting moving forward we. And there's huge funding gaps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I just want to say that I fully support the bike ped crossing and I'm happy with the improvements that have been made to this project. I don't love the The Tube walkway, but I also listen to the Transportation Commission weighing in and I thought they did make some good points.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vela, Councilor Odie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. I'll weigh in now. So. I mean, at the onset, I'll just say, you know, I've I've been critical when people use the Sunshine Ordinance to kind of block things that I'm in favor of. But I also think it would be hypocritical if I basically say we should ignore it for something I am in favor of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm a little bit disturbed about the my colleague's comment notwithstanding. I mean, the whole transparency on this issue. I'm deeply concerned because the way I understand this played out, know we had the letter and, you know, advocates of the crossing, the additional crossing, thought it was an opportunity to kind of leverage the only thing we really'",
        "'speaker_1': 'have to leverage to get funding for the next additional steps on the project. And then the letter went through the transportation committee in full sunshine, and it was changed. And the advice was to, you know, not give away portions of it right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then it came to the Council on an Agenda item, and there were objections to basically holding up one project that would benefit Chinatown, both from residents of Chinatown and Aluminums with connections to the Chinatown neighborhood. Valid connections.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But at the same time, you know, there were concerns from the advocates of the Bike Walk Bridge that, you know, we really would not have any opportunity in the future to help secure funding. So there was the conditional letter that was sent out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, I spent a lot of the day today talking to a number of the advocates of the bridge and also folks that were concerned in Chinatown, because I think those are legitimate concerns as a project that's been on the board for 20 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. You know, I'm fully supportive of that project. And, you know, I think to, you know, kind of threaten it or, you know, put it at risk. I think there were some valid concerns raised by my my folks that are concerned about the safety in the Chinatown neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, you know, I don't want to get into designing, but, you know, I don't think we should have a way where you can continue to do what you do today. But that's not really on my on my my to do list.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So then we had well, those discussions are going on and there's community concern. Now there's a letter from Oakland that was in support dated November six that I saw for the first time this afternoon. There was a letter from AC DC dated yesterday that I saw for the first time this afternoon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was a revised letter that the public had no input on. And, you know, I'm going to be irrelevant in a month, but I didn't think I'd be considered irrelevant today or that the rest of us would be irrelevant today, because it seemed that this was all done in a vacuum.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there were some legitimate concerns raised by both the advocates of the bridge and concerns about the advocates of this project that I think should have been fleshed out in public and not in private. I don't understand why that information could not have been conveyed to us, and we as a council could have could have made that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'decision. But, you know, a couple of things. I will I will comment on it. Yeah. And then we basically. We are always looking for a win win where we could not say that we're going to put one project at risk over another project, but also find a way where we could get some guarantee of some funding and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we got one half of that win with this revised letter. But we don't have the other half of that win, so we don't have any guaranteed funding, and maybe that's possible, but I don't even think we have a path forward to that guaranteed funding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I will say I like the the vice mayor suggestion that we get a commitment before we approve this letter from AC DC that their staff will make a they will make a commitment to recommend funding for the PSR and environmental study.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that's a brilliant idea and I think it gets us closer to a win win. You know, just a couple of things. I don't think that the current Webster Street design or Webster tube design, that's not really multi-modal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think that's what everyone thinks of when they think of some multimodal crossing. You know, I've never done it. I never will because I have asthma and I'm not going to subject myself to walking through that tube or biking through that tube.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think the pictures of all those people walking and biking, that's not going to happen. I mean, let's just be real here about that. You know, the one thing I do appreciate about this process and, you know, speaking to Lina, I'm a former member of this council about her letter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, this really this has to be a collaboration. We can't do this without regional support. And I appreciate that. She took the time, you know, during a family emergency today to speak to me about this about this important issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'd like to see as part of any motion to approve this that we engage our state reps because they know they can have a lot of influence on Caltrans. And Caltrans, from what I understand, is who wants that additional right away, even more so than than bike pedestrians?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would like to see, as the vice mayor suggested, that we get a commitment from Ictsi today that they will make a recommendation to authorize this funding. And I'd like to see our alternate Mr. Naxalite also involved in this process because he is on AC DC as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you know, he's a very knowledgeable and person with a lot of expertize in this area who's been fighting for this topic for many years. So I wish we could have got a win win. I think we have a win.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then, I don't know, I'd like to get a win and a closer to a win. So I'm hopefully hopeful my colleagues can move the ball forward on both of these projects. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Early Council for Design.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, great. Well, thank you very much. This project is a long time in coming. When it was first brought to my attention back in 1997, when I was on city council back then, it was certainly framed as improving Alameda Residences, access to 80, northbound or southbound to get to work, as well as being a safety related project'",
        "'speaker_1': 'along the way. Through the 2000, we certainly had to have some negotiations with stakeholders in in the vicinity, particularly Chinatown, Oakland's Chinatown. And it seems to me that at long last we've come up with a project that that can help residents get off the island, but also deal with some of the issues and concerns raised by residents'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and and those who are intimately involved in Oakland, Chinatown, some of whom live here in Alameda for a long time. My firm my foremost concern in all of this has always been getting Alameda ins off the island and to 80.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And frankly, for the long, longest time that has been met, that has meant focusing on improving vehicular traffic out of Alameda through the tubes Posey tubes and hope and getting on to 880 as quickly as possible vehicular traffic because at the end of the day when you look at the data, vehicular traffic is whether it's on a'",
        "'speaker_1': 'single occupancy basis or whether it's on a carpool basis. At the end of the day, in terms of commuters, especially the morning peak hour commuters, that is the preponderance of of people needing to access infrastructure like Posey Tube, something like 74% of all commuters in Alameda who are employed take vehicles, whether it's by single occupancy vehicle, which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is, I think 64% or whether it's carpooling, which is 9% as bus, 74%. And so and that has always been the case, and I suspect it will continue to be the case in too many years. Let us hope and I think it will be the case that future vehicular traffic will be electric and alternative fuels.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but we need this kind of infrastructure to facilitate that. My disappointment in this project, I will go ahead and express it is the sense that, you know, we have long. Frankly speaking, enjoy the 45 mile per hour speed in the posi tube.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At least I've enjoyed it because it's the only place in Alameda where you can really go 45 miles per hour. Other than that short, small portion of Doolittle Drive, there is a small portion of the dual drive. But and, you know, knowing that we that we're going to change that 45 miles per hour to generally 35 miles'",
        "'speaker_1': 'per hour and then slow it down even more to 20 miles per hour before we take the. The horseshoe certainly is a concern. I can't see my time, by the way, but it seems to me the data is saying, even as we slow down the the the rate that travelers will be going through the Posey Tube, even'",
        "'speaker_1': 'as we slow that down, there will actually be time savings between the time that they enter the tube and get on into 80. Actually think the time saving is going to result because we're no longer going around, you know, the Chinese garden park.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think most of the time savings is because of that and not because of the the time spent in the tube, but that. Be that as it may. The fact of the matter is, the data says significantly that there will be a 30% savings in time in 2025 and 2045.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can expect a 45% savings in time. So what that means, for example, if on average the the trip to the tube is. I don't know, 7 minutes. So instead of 7 minutes right now, it will now be roughly 4 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If this is all to be believed. So I'm making my decision based upon the data that I'm seeing here. And I'm going to support this. I think it is needed infrastructure, especially for facilitating vehicular traffic out of the posi tube, especially in the morning peak commute hours.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And as our island grows even more with more development, we're going to need this infrastructure to get started sooner rather than later. So I just want to thank every stakeholder who's been involved in this throughout the many years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know there are outstanding issues. Like the bike bridge. I think that should be separate from the fact that we need to get going. The that as indicated in the earlier phase a the core project we need to get the core project going, which is the horseshoe and which is a on ramp down for people coming into'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Alameda in the evenings. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember de. Thank you. Good comments, everyone. I want to follow up on something the vice mayor said and and I will put this on gel a little bit on the spot that she volunteered to come to this meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm really so glad that you were able to hear all the comments and from the members of the public. I wanted to highlight Councilmember Bell. I think she just as she often almost always does, is so eloquent in articulating some some great points.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, you're all you were all added to this discussion. But so I'm to the the ask by the vice mayor, what kind of commitment would DC staff make to recommending funding that we had originally asked for as a condition of our approval for it, for the for the Oakland Media Access Project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you know, Andrew. Well, what what was possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you, mayor and thank you councilmembers. And it is it has been very good to hear all of the comments by all of you as well as members of the public. And I certainly know the importance of this crossing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Alameda CDC has committed to funding in the past for it. So as I said in my letter to you yesterday, if I can get a letter from the city of Alameda, I commit to bringing forward a consideration of the next phase for this project to my commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I do want to note that the Commission funds by phases. We don't fund the project from a a feasibility study through construction because we need to fund BI phase. There's a lot of work I think we need to do between now and the time that it comes to the commission to make sure we're checking, recommending to the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda City Commission an appropriate level of funding and appropriate next phase. And I would like to work with your staff to address that. There's been discussion of a PSR, there's been discussion of environmental document, there's been discussion of estimated costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's important that we have the opportunity to really sit down and talk about those those items so that we have something clear that we're actually bringing to the commission for their consideration. And I certainly welcome those meetings with you, Mayor, and with Vice Mayor John White as well, and staff from the city of Alameda'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And we I'd be happy to set those up. As soon as I get your letter, we can start setting setting those up. And I committed to that yesterday.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At your your muted nature.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will just add, it's not that I tried to exclude the vice mayor. It's just that we have this Brown act and we can make arrangements ahead of time before an item comes to to then just be the only two who are discussing something that's going to come to the council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I thank you for for those remarks. So here's my feeling, and then I'll take a little more input from from counsel as to how you would like to proceed. I believe that it is important and essential that the city of Alameda, represented by this council approves gives our approval to the Oakland Alameda Access Project because it's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what you have all stated and our speakers have very eloquently stated before us that these cars continuing to come through the tube and go around that lovely center, the Chinese garden, and and, you know, it just you wouldn't want that for for a center that you tried to to frequent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it is has not been fair to Chinatown all these years. And now we have a solution. And it it really it is true. It is an auto centric solution. But we aren't going to stop cars from going through the tube.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we certainly can stop the horrendous impact that they have had on Oakland's Chinatown. And I would hope that we don't hold that that project hostage. But as I told my policy committee a week ago, it's also possible for two things to be true at the same time and to need to move forward on them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Some of this is going to require trust because even sitting here tonight, we can't get the guaranteed funding. I mean, I just we can't get that tonight. Soon, I think we can get some pretty good assurances that it is there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I can tell you, I've had conversations with lots of my fellow commissioners about the importance of this project and gotten their enthusiastic support. And I, I really take that to heart. So what I'm looking for is how to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because the other thing I just want to touch on is that it was asked, why didn't this all happened a year ago? We should have been asking for funding a year ago. You know, a lot has happened in this year, in this year of COVID and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But one of the biggest obstacles we had to deal with was the Coast Guard. And it was no easy feat at getting them to come around and see that it was possible to have this bridge over navigable waterways right outside a Coast Guard base.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And again, I give huge credit. Rodney Pimentel, you're just the man of the hour tonight that because he I sit in meetings and I it could be like they're speaking Greek, but I can follow a little bit. But he understands he's a bridge engineer and he talks with the Coast Guard engineers and he understands their concerns and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'he is able to match every one of their questions with that, with an answer. And the Coast Guard has come around that it was not a quick and easy process, but here we are tonight. What should we do?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am open to suggestions and tell me what your pleasure is, Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I just want to ask a question of Mr. Rangel, if I could, because I think I heard her answer my question, and we may just be using different terms, but so when you say you will bring forward the city's request, I heard you say, you know, that we will commit I will commit to bringing to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'support bringing this forward. It sounded way the last time I heard you say it. It's anything you said as a staff recommendation to the council, to the to the committee was that was I was I trying to hear too much in your comments?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I think that for me, the question is, are you bringing it forward, saying, hey, the city's asked about this or are you bringing this forward and saying, hey, we've been working with the city on always things that we are making a request.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, we are we are bringing forward this recommendation, you know, as a recommendation of both AC, DC and the city of Alameda that we find the funding for the PSR in the air.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to be clear, there are two things in the letter that I said yesterday. There are two pathways. There's one for the CHP, which I would not be able to bring a recommendation in January for the CHP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's a competitive process. It needs to go through all the vetting and analysis. I cannot. Agreeing that what I can bring is the fact if I get a letter from the city requesting consideration for this because of the 2014 letter, then I can bring a recommendation for the Commission's consideration of the request.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just want to be really clear that we only fund by phase in when I mean phase. That's their very distinct project development phases. And so what is in your memo is both the PSR and the environmental documents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And like I said, I'd like to talk with you and staff about what is the actual appropriate thing to bring to the commission for a next phase. Is the PSR the appropriate thing to bring? Is the cost appropriate that's there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think there's more vetting that needs to happen for that. And I, I very much look forward to that conversation with with you the mate, with you mayor and with you vice mayor, as well as whichever staff you want to bring or however many staff you want to bring to have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And let me jump in here, if I may, for just a minute. Vice Mayor. You know, I'll just say right here in front of me on the screen, we've got staff and I know they've been working about on this and thinking about this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Mr. Thomas, in this waiver, be prepared to end mute when in answer to direct your line, Shell's comments, questions about, you know, we find in phases we'd need to know what the logical next phase is sitting here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you know what that would be or do you need to have more more meetings?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, I this Andrew Thomas, I think what the executive director say makes sense. Let's let's formalize what the what is the logical next step? It is the continuation of the design process for members of the public. We have a feasibility study that we've been working on with Acts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It shows it's feasible to build a bridge we need to the next steps. From a layman's perspective, and I'm a layman here, not a bridge engineer. We need to actually sit down with Oakland and we've started these conversations like exactly where is this bridge going to be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it going to be on this street? On that street? Where do these where do the landings land? What are the logical next steps in this planning process that we need to do to then get to the next step, which will be the environmental process?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then the next step is the permitting process, and then the next step is raising the money to build it. And then so there's a series of steps. So I think that makes complete sense. I just I think what I heard the vice mayor asking is assuming we can scope out that next step, which I have no'",
        "'speaker_6': 'doubt that the people on this Zoom call can do that, you know, in short order, because we've been working on this and talking about it for months and months and months. I mean, I think the question for the vice mayor is, assuming we can work that out and it all makes sense, is TCE staff going to be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'just saying is are they going to be recommending it to their their commission? Can they and would they? That's the sort of I think that's kind of what the vice mayor is asking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Thomas. Is that is it the project study report you were describing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or I mean, whether it's. Yes, I mean, essentially, you might it might go by a different name because it's a different process. But essentially, it's let's come up with the sort of essentially the final design and so that we can then get to the next step, which is the environmental review process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's essentially what we have now. We have a project study report for the oakland alameda access project. It would be trying to get the bridge project to this to this level.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And actually vice mayor. Or maybe this will.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be muted and ender, I think laid out the question I guess I'm so curious about. I'm not. Yeah, I'm less interested in what is the process to get to presenting because I think I'm clear on that. I'm still asking the question well asked.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'SCB partnering with the city to bring this as a recommendation for action, or will they be bringing it as forward as a Here's something for you to consider. The city has asked us to that's that's the that's the nuance on that that I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It and if that was any. And thank you, Vice Mayor, then for Ms.. Martel, was that enough specificity from Mr. Thomas? That's not to say that to preclude any meetings, but is that a direction that you're looking for?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I think there are a lot of technical, technical issues that we need to address in terms of what can position this project to go after funding. As Andrew mentioned, there is a large funding need for this project and we need to develop this project in a way where we do the right kind of studies that can'",
        "'speaker_0': 'open the pathway for funding. And that's where I would really like to have that conversation so that when we bring a recommendation and I've committed to bringing something to the commission for the next phase, that we are bringing the appropriate information that they can then consider as part of their own deliberation as an agency.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a funding agency.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You're muted. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As I tell other people that met a vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And still I've still I've I understand that and I'm on board with we need to figure out what is the right path and whatever else. The question still remains is, is it coming forth as a recommendation from staff or is it just coming forward as a something?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is it something for the the committee, the committee and the commissions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We we bring recommendations to the commission.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So your staff will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be we bring recommendations to our committees and our committees. Consider those recommendations. And then it's actually the committees that make the recommendation to the full commission. Excellent.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. It's that that that was the nuance. I was trying to make sure I was correct. So with that with that clarity, I am happy to recommend a letter with direction to staff or to send that letter to AC DC and get those letters set up so that we can start that process that that executive director'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jones has laid out for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And for clarification, you're recommending both approval of the letter the the the letter from the mayor and the letter to be sent from staff. Correct. That the front door has multiple times that she's waiting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For follow both pathways. But yes. The letter to start work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes. Thank you. And then the second by you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. And we're we're we're doing our letter and the staff, the revised letter, plus the two pathways in Mr. Rangel's letter, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, good point, actually. Good point, Councilmember Odie, and thank you for the second. These are not mutually exclusive propositions, if I understand correctly. That's right. We can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We can have our cake and eat it, too. And yes, we this is and these are first steps to early funding, but. Yes. Okay, a second. Thank you. I'll get any further discussion. Seeing then we have a roll call vote, please.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That sounds unanimous to me. I want to thank everybody who's been here and this evening and for all the hours you've been working on this, and we'll work on this still some more. But I do think it was really valuable to to be able to hear from both our counsel and our public about what an important'",

    "Recreation and Park Fees Revision and Addition for 2021.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. Thank you. So I'll go ahead and jump in. So there's a variety of factors that determine user fees for the Recreation and Parks Department fee schedule. These include rising costs for staff, contractual services, utilities, and we always are trying to balance these increasing fees with market demand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So to do this, we compare with other local cities such as San Leandro, Emeryville, Fremont, Union City, and we also do comparison specific comparisons with local on island organizations and facilities such as Girls Inc for afterschool programs and local large rental facilities such as the Elks Lodge, Oakland Yacht Club, Eagle Hall and local gyms as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this year we worked there's there's not nearly as many fee increases as know. We're very we're very sparse with our fee increases as we really understand that due to the pandemic, we recognize the economic impact it's had on so many people, especially people of color.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for and to ensure continued equity, we're also we wanted to really keep that at a minimum of our fee increases. And we're also working separately to increase our efforts to provide financial assistance across all our programs, both making it easier to apply and providing more funding.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So and this, this 21, 2021 fee schedule before you was unanimously recommended as presented by the Recreation and Parks Commission. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Get.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. So this is a cost recovery model that we always build our fees based on. And the overall how it works is at the top of the pyramid, you have the individual benefits, what we call the high cost recovery program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So these are programs that are designed for individual benefit, that are optional, participate in they, and therefore people are asked to pay a more premium price for that opportunity to participate in these programs, such as adults, sports facility rentals and highly specialized summer camps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The ones in the middle are considered net cost recovery, so those will basically cover their costs or have a small profit. And their programs are designed for larger groups or multiple groups that pay for the opportunity to participate in a program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But but we want to make sure it's covering the costs. So to make it as affordable as possible to as many as we can. Those are things such as our classes and our summer camps, our afterschool programs, our tiny top programs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we have the bottom, the most broad, low to no cost recovery. And these the cost of these are offset in part by the the the the ones at the top where we are making more of a profit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And these programs are free or low cost and they're designed for as many people as possible to access often those that are economically disadvantaged. And these are our include programs such as our mastic senior center programs are park free parks and playgrounds that we really here at LAPD.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We really value everyone in our community and recognize that not everyone has the capacity to pay fees. And we are one of the few remaining recreation departments, really the only one that I know of in our local area that still provides this free programing for youth through parks and playgrounds where they're at the parks, six parks every'",
        "'speaker_0': 'day after school and at five parks during the summers. For the last five years, we've also had the Free Park Baseball Summer program and they are completely free and continue to be so based on city council support and for the summer baseball program, also sponsorship from the Elks Club.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And also I always like to point out that every park site has at least one picnic area that's free, first come, first serve. So, so we, we try and make sure we're providing as many opportunities as possible. Next slide, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So these are the fees that we are proposing to increase this year. One is the youth athletic. The athletic fields for our youth user groups. We've been increasing this $1 per year every year for the last several years, and that's based on regular discussions with the user groups there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're aware of this increase every year. And what we did is, is the fees used to be a set $500 a season and it was not a sustainable model. And so we switched to this hourly rate and with the goal to eventually get to ten or $11 per hour.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we recognized that we didn't want to do a big jump all at once. So we're doing it incrementally. And by doing this, by increasing these fees, it will help us better recover field maintenance costs such as fertilizer and field equipment, maintenance, water, utilities, the gym increase that you see before you for only made a point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Jim was based on an annual fee increase schedule that was adopted by council in 2019. So we continued with that set schedule to incrementally increase that over the next three years. Our group swim lessons, some actually went down.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What we did is we used to have some lessons that were 45 minutes, some that were 30 minutes, and we actually decided to adjust all of the lessons to 30, 30 minutes. So the ones that were longer obviously came down in cost those group fees and there was also a slight increase for private fees.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, even with the increase in private fees, we've been increasing those over the last few years. The proposed fee is still significantly less than the cost of our our local folks of Aquatic and Harbor Bay Club. And we have a deep waiting list for those our youth programs, we're proposing an increase of 2%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Our standard is 5% each year as what we've been doing for several years. But this year, again, we minimized it to 2% due to the economic hardships faced by many of our families due to COVID 19. So just to put it in kind of number terms, this is the equivalent 4 to $1 per week for $62 per'",
        "'speaker_0': 'week program for after school program. Next slide, please. Great. So in terms of new fees, a few of these sort, so the cleanup fee you see before you is only if a large mess is made. It's really not that frequent, but it does happen sometimes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're really implementing this fee only as a deterrent. We're hoping not to use it and just would cover our staff costs to clean up after user groups who don't clean up after themselves. So we'll let them know and use it to encourage them to do it themselves.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The veterans building didn't have specific fees and once were a post-COVID. We'd like to expand rental opportunities there. In regards to lifeguards, we are now requiring lifeguards for all swim facility rentals, including the user groups of swim and water polo teams, master's teams.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not something that was previously required but really is best practice and also reduces the city's liability. And we have discussed this with the youth, with the user groups. They've expressed that they're fine with it and they recognize that it's not realistic for their coaches to be adequately supervising folks in the water for safety, as lifeguards'",
        "'speaker_0': 'do. You know, they're focused on one or two youth and their swimming techniques, and they're not looking at everything that's going on at the pool. Regarding adult sports tournaments, this is something we didn't have a fee for, but as a new program, we'd like to again, post-COVID, start offering things such as adult softball, dodgeball, things like that'",
        "'speaker_0': '. The youth per hour cost is something that it doesn't supplant or other youth fees. It really is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we need to advance the slides that way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I was doing it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our youth per our course is something that simply provides us with more flexibility, such as what we needed during COVID. We need to react quickly or when we need to or want to start trial. A New Program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This provides us an opportunity to start a smaller program or make an adjustment as needed. It's still any standard program, such as after school program or camps will still follow the fees shown in the user fee schedule. So with that concludes my report, and I'm happy to answer any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I didn't ask, do we have any public speakers on this item?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We do not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Counsel, any. The floor is open. Comments, questions, motion. And I just want to thank Ms. Wooldridge for all the incredible work you do day in and day out, but also during this pandemic, how you and your staff have just pivoted so wonderfully to continue serving our our community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You did a great job on Halloween, making it fun and festive and coming up with really creative alternatives. So I thank you for that. And I know you have some some plans up your sleeve for the winter holidays coming up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But thank you for for doing that, because, you know, recreation is just so important, especially now when we're all sheltering in place and the news doesn't seem to be getting any better right now. But we we have opened all of our parks and playgrounds, basketball courts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just still ask you to do things you know, you're supposed to be doing. Wear your mask, social distance, wash your hands frequently. But council questions, comments, motion by some are not quite.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will concur. I appreciate all the thought that has gone into this for me. I would like to recommend and I just noticed that the city manager's alternative recommendation. I would like to recommend that we consider adopting all the new proposed fees, but that we actually freeze the fees for the rest of our offerings for 2021'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Given that, you know, first off, I'm just hard pressed to believe that we're going to have a lot of use at any of these facilities in 2021. And then I know that our nonprofits are being hit pretty hard and they're going to be struggling financially.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And again, as I've said in other conversations, I think that the city is one of the few places that actually has the money that we can spend to provide services. And while I know it's going to be a little bit of a hit, I think we should acknowledge that our parents and nonprofits are taking a pretty huge'",
        "'speaker_4': 'one in a lot of ways, and that I would like to just recommend that we do that. So I will hold off making that as a motion because I know other people may have thoughts, but I'm ready to make that motion, if anybody interested.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Rosemary. Next week, Councilor Odie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I think structure will bridge. I think there's a lot of thought that went into these, especially given the pandemic. But I concur with the vice mayor suggestion that we adopt new categories and regulations, but defer the actual increases until 2022, basically for the same reasons.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our nonprofits are going to be hard pressed to have to pay for anything, you know, let alone, you know. I'm not even sure when we're going to have an opportunity to have, you know, for example, you know, basketball games and such like that given given the trajectory directory of the pandemic and the fact that it's basically being'",
        "'speaker_1': 'ignored until at least January 20th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bank accounts everybody else everyday so you're in muted is that because you want to comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. My quick comment is, let's see, the fee increases that are contemplated are basically meant to recover costs stemming from a use by certain groups or activities. So the costs someone will still clean up. If for whatever reason you know there is a mess, someone will still have to clean up that mess and someone will still have'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to provide swimming lessons if there are to be swimming lessons. If there are swimming lessons. So there's a service rendered and there's a cost associated with the service rendered. So it seems to me the costs that fee increases that are are part director has suggested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I think they seem to be reasonable in light of the the potential. The potential demand for a Forest Service. It doesn't seem to be out of line. That's. That's my take.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Villa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, when I spoke with the city manager about this item prior to the meeting, one of the questions I had was how many people are actually using these facilities or making these rentals? How many of them are actually available right now?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the reason I asked that was because I think in many respects, people aren't necessarily having the same. There isn't the same demand for these things. Certainly, I think on our on our outdoor camps and things like that, we've had to make some significant changes and modifications to that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That said, I know that many families are struggling right now. And every dollar makes a difference. The other thing that I want to put out there for my colleagues is that a lot of our sports programs and teams and leagues, the way that they cover their costs is through tournaments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would hate to create a situation where we're actually encouraging people to go out and and violate essentially violate county orders in order to try to make money right now to stay afloat, to keep up with increasing costs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think, you know, I've reached out to some of the leagues and I just wanted to get a sense of kind of what were they doing and what are they, you know, what are their finances looking like?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know, for instance, that that alone needs a little league. And then some of these groups, some of our largest nonprofits in town are, in fact, our sports sporting organizations. And and they're taking a huge hit and huge losses this year because they couldn't run their tournaments and and, you know, they reimbursed money and stuff like'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that. So I would agree with adopting, but it's kind of freezing and basically putting off the increases. I think that there's a lot of uncertainty right now, and I think it's the responsible thing to do. I understand that the costs will go up, but I also question how many of these things are are really going to make'",
        "'speaker_0': 'a difference in the event that we have people who are you know, we have these these pauses happening. And the bigger focus, the greater focus is on the pandemic and making sure that we have an adequate response. So I'm with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I actually, you know, with I'd like to hear from the mayor and you know, but I'm leaning towards the alternative recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you, Councilmember Villa. I am just wondering and if you can help us out, Mr. Baldridge, on the page six and your alternatives. It does note that if the air user fee schedule is not approved, it will negatively impact the recreation fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what what are the implications of the recreation fund not having as much revenue as anticipated?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you. Sure. Sure. Thank you, Mark. The impact would be coming back in mid-year or the next budget cycle for a potentially greater increasing the general fund transfer and require more funds from the general fund to offset because our expenditures don't change a whole lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We still are maintaining the fields too, so they don't get overgrown, you know, things like that. Our rental facilities are closed. That's the primary thing that's closed currently. And it's it's a it's a big revenue generator for us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's in that top end of the triangle. And even with our youth programs, we have a much because of COVID, a higher sorry, lower staff to child ratio. So we have higher costs to revenue ratio we normally would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's a long answer to that. I also want to add one thing in regards. I understand the concerns. I'm fine with that. I would like to look at the swim center, swim lesson cost, because we would like to shift everything to a half hour, 30 minute lesson.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So some of them are actually going it's they're actually going down. So I'd like counsel two to consider this one lesson adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Okay. And what about the fact that you now are going to need to hire more lifeguards because of this change in policy? Do you have the funding to do that or will we?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In terms of funding, there, there. We only put them out there when we have the revenue. The lifeguards are out there when we have the swim lessons happening or when we have the user groups out there. So the lifeguard fee is a new fee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as I understand this, this this motion as it's developing, is it that would be covered under the new fee?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It doesn't it won't impact new fees. Okay. Okay. Can we just go back to the slides? Is there a way we can or. I would like to just look and see a comparison of the new fees and the existing fees.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. We are bringing that up. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So these are all existing. Well, except the swim lessons there are wet and tractable, which is saying she'd like the council to consider because they are making an adjustment now that all lessons will be 30 minutes. So.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, got that. Okay, so here's the new fees. Okay. Um, and I forgot, is there when we're paging this. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Okay. So then based here, that's what I think you. We're starting to make a motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Were you or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Durbin? I would like to move to call now an amended city manager's alternative proposal that we hold all the 2020 fees through 2021, with the exception of the the proposed reduction in swim fees that are reduced and accept the proposed new fees as as proposed with great appreciation to staff and an understanding of this art.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. And a very valid. Did you want to speak to that or is that you, Conservative Councilor Brody blow.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. We have a motion. It's been seconded will be further discussion seeing. Then we had a motion made by Vice Swett, seconded by Councilmember o.T. We have a roll call vote for.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'No.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, we're putting them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. We can arrange that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my name is Lisa Fitz, and I manage the Community Development BLOCK Grant Program, also known as CDBG. Do I have control over the slides?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. We can advance them for you if you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think we're at like number four. If we could go to number two. That would be great. Okay. Thank you. So CDBG Cares Act funding. As you know, the city of Alameda receives CDBG funds from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in September 2020, HUD announced that the city of Alameda would receive an allocation of $597,112. This is in addition to the first tranche of CARES Act funding that the city was awarded in June of 2020 in the amount of $683,116.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next slide, please. So the purpose of tonight's hearing is threefold. First, to accept and allocate the recently awarded funds. Second, to reprogram entitlement funds for the purchase and installation of community cabins. And third, to authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute related documents, agreements and modifications.'",

For this for the CARES Act funds staff proposes that council accept and allocate 100% of the new CARES Act funds to public services that provide food or shelter to families and individuals who are vulnerable and in crisis as a result of the coronavirus.'",

It should be noted that both emergency rent relief and emergency case management were approved and included in the current fiscal year action plan. Tonight, we are proposing to remove those from the current plan and have them funded by the Care with CARES Act funds instead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By doing this, it frees up money in the entitlement. I would like to also point out that the services on the screen would be offered through the end of the fiscal year. And if HUD continues to offer or continues to waive the 15% cap on public services, then safe parking and day center operation services could potentially be'",

Entitlement Funds staff proposes to amend the action planned to program $200,000 for community cabins, leaving the remaining $961,057 untouched.

        "'speaker_3': 'De. I'm sorry. And this way. Councilmember Desai.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Just to go on. Okay. Good. Clarifying question. In terms of the community cabins, do we have any are there is has any thought been given to persons who are in the parking program, transitioning them to the community cabins, making them available?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How how what kind of thought are we giving as to who is eligible for for for that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a great question. So tonight, actually, we're really talking about allocating funds for the potential purchase of the cabins before the program is designed fully. We will have to identify there are few steps that will be taking, including contracting with a social service agency to provide services.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But realistically, we expect that the cabins would become could potentially become shelter to people who are currently living in their cars.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Does $200,000 purchase? We expect that it'll cover it will provide 12 to 15 accounts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, great. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. And thank you very much for for taking my question. I just had a question about the community cabins and where will they be located. That's a great question, and that's something that is currently being worked out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'City staff has said that it's no excuse the interruption and this is perfectly appropriate. Your your answer. Public comment is normally public comment and not Q&A. However, I think we can apply common sense and I'm sure that would have been part of your presentation and maybe in answer to a few future council questions on this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Chair. Sorry about that. So, yeah, there will there are like I said, in response to Councilmember de Sox question, there are a few steps that have to be taken before my money will actually be expended. We would have to identify a location.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will have to contract with a service provider. We'll have to assess the location to meet HUD standards. So at this time, the location is it has not been identified.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Miss. And that was was that all of our public speakers?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was all of the speakers.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thanks, Miss Butler. I'll miss your presentations when I don't hear them anymore. And thanks misfits for your presentation. I think in this particular topic you'll have one of the most heartwarming but probably one of the most frustrating jobs.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because, you know, every every dollar that you give benefits an individual in need, yet there's never enough to go around. So I appreciate all the hard work you've done to serve our community and serve some of our most deserving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think what's what's important to me about this agenda item is it shows what government can do. I mean, government should be there for the good of people, and it has a purpose to help people and serve people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why, you know, I always get emotional during this presentation, even after six years, because, again, I think it shows what we can do and it goes to the core and the heart of who we are as individuals and our belief that our government can actually spend money and make things better for people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So tremendous thanks to you all and all the hard work you do and all the tough decisions you make.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ody, and other comments. Discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vice-Chair That's why I guess I'd be happy to cosign everything Councilmember Odie said in approval of the item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give me a minute to make my comments too. But Councilmember, despite Councilmember Vela.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was just going to second.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have a motion of approval. We have a second motion by the Vice-Chair, seconded by Councilmember de SAC. Any discussion? Yes, Councilmember Vela. But hence you go first and I'll go next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just want to just thank staff for their work on this. I know that there are a lot of moving parts, and certainly I think we've made it very clear, at least from the council perspective, of our desire to fund these things and to put housing and transitional housing at the top of that list.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to thank staff for making sure that the money and the funds that we're receiving are going directly towards that. So that was my comment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilor Rivera. And I was just going to say that I found out last week that there's your double use, a countywide sales tax increase passed just barely by the skin of its teeth, because on last Wednesday night, we had our Alameda County mayor's covers meeting and our guest speaker was Cory Abbott, who is in charge'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of the county's program on homelessness. And so then I asked her the question because she was talking about these Project Roomkey hotels that are being purchased by the counties and by cities. And so I asked her with funding from Measure W, could that be used to help purchase some of these properties?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because I still have my eye on the Marina Village in and I know we're on the short list. We didn't quite make it, but we're on the short list and and her face just fell and she said, well, you know, I don't think Measure W passed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then I felt terrible for even asking the question, but the next night I was checking results and I looked and it had gone ahead just barely. But it needed, you know, 50% plus one vote. And it got more it went vote over 50%.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I quickly emailed her and I said, Am I reading this correctly? Mr. Abbott emailed back and said yes and I look forward to working with the city of Alameda on the allocation of these funds. And I will let you know that the mayors of Alameda County, most of the mayors, I'd say serve ten or 11 of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the 14 have signed a letter to the county board of Supervisors asking that the mayors have a seat at the table when the county is determining expenditure and allocation of these funds. So we can just make sure that our needs in cities are known.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's to be determined. But, you know, I think it's it's good news, certainly, that I mean, obviously, it's a sales tax and the revenue has to come in.

So the task force has been meeting since July, just about every other week.'",

One crucial source of information for this work has been a series of focus groups that we've been conducting with the sectors listed on the slides.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So one of our earliest findings was that we heard from the public health department that even with the vaccine, we can expect social distancing measures into 2022. So we heard this pretty early on, and this estimate had a pretty significant impact on how the task force was thinking about the timing of the emergency and the timing'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of our recovery. We're also seeing a pretty big racial hellscape related to the pandemic in Alameda County. Latin Mex population has the highest rate of infection, followed by the Pacific Islander and black residents. And the black population has the highest rate of deaths due to COVID 19.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're also seeing greater job loss among women, people of color and those without advanced degrees. So we're seeing more women, more black workers, and also more workers with a high school education or less who are filing for unemployment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next slide, please. From our businesses and nonprofit owners. We're hearing about a lot of confusion and frustration around our county health orders. So couple examples of this are new health orders will be issued on a Friday and that doesn't leave businesses much time to prepare for any changes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Uncertainty about the timing or future health orders that can make it difficult for businesses to plan for reopening. And then also some frustration about the differences between the county and state guidelines, which can cause confusion, which when new changes are announced at the state level, but they don't apply to Alameda County from businesses that have reopened.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We're hearing that expenses have increased significantly due to COVID 19, and that has to do with the cost of PPE, the cost of cleaning, and in some cases having to hire staff in order to enforce public health orders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At the same time, their revenues are down because capacity is limited and demand is also down. So we're hearing from many businesses that they're dipping into savings or going into debt to make ends meet. And the ones who were lucky enough to receive federal, state or local aid report that that money is is quickly running out if'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it hasn't already. So as a result, unless unless conditions change, we do expect to see many more business closures this winter. So one thing that really is making a difference to businesses is access to outdoor spaces, including shared public spaces through the Commercial Streets program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, there are concerns about the viability of these spaces with winter approaching, and of course, there are many businesses who can't bring their work outdoors.

        "'speaker_0': 'These are they're actually expected to be one of the last to recover with full recovery, not expected till 2023 or 2024. In terms of office space businesses, we're hearing that the impact of the pandemic has been very uneven.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are some businesses, particularly in the life sciences, that are still viable or even thriving, but others who are really feeling the impact, for example, or co-working spaces have still not yet been able to open. In the long term, we're hearing that while there is going to be an increase in remote work, that there will still be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'demand for physical office space in Alameda. There's a couple of reasons for that. One is the importance of in-person work for creativity and innovation and accountability. Another is that businesses are reporting that their employees actually do want to maintain some kind of presence in the office.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And maybe that's not a full week, but maybe that's two or three days out of the week in the office and two or three days at home. And then finally, we also heard that the office stock in Alameda is well suited to COVID recovery.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's low density. There's not many elevators and there's plentiful parking. Next slide, please. So in the childcare sector, we're seeing that many childcare providers have shut down or are experiencing reduced enrollment. And there's the kind of describe the strange phenomenon where they heard a lot of interest from parents at first about when are you going to open'",
        "'speaker_0': 'up, when can we send our kids back? But when they actually opened, enrollment was much lower than had been planned and they actually had to shut down some of their programs. So there's a real concern that when the pandemic lifts and the demand comes back, that these programs may not be there anymore.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One thing we heard across the board in all of the sectors we talked to was about the importance of Internet access and tech literacy for businesses and workers. So we heard this with childcare. You know, they hadn't had ever expected to have maybe support online learning, right?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a lot of them had to expand their Internet capacity to work with that. And we also heard that workers, and particularly those without college degrees, sometimes lack the skills and access to technology that is required to file for unemployment, apply for new jobs, or even just connect with other workers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And finally, we heard a lot about mental health challenges for businesses and workers. And this was another thing that was across all of the groups we spoke with. You know, these folks are under tremendous stress. They are worried about losing their jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're worried about losing their businesses. The business owners are worried about their employees. And everyone's really concerned about making ends meet. And at the same time, they're worried about getting COVID or bringing COVID home to someone who may be more vulnerable in their family or their household.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then on top of that, on top of all this, a lot of these frontline employees are in the position of having to enforce public health orders. So they are dealing with angry or just noncompliant customers. Next, Chris.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So during the task force process, it became clear that this wasn't there was a need for immediate assistance assistance. This wasn't something that could wait until after a plan had been developed. There were also a number of activities that were already in process in the city under the leadership of city council and in a number of different'",
        "'speaker_0': 'departments. I'm just going to go through kind of some of these interim measures here. So the spend local campaign is something we've been working on to try to boost sales for our businesses over the holidays. That's going to be launching on Saturday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Another thing the pandemic really brought out is the importance of businesses talking to each other across, promoting learning from one another, advocating. And so as a result of that, we've been we worked with the Chamber of Commerce to launch a Personal Care Services Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's also been a massive citywide effort to permit alfresco dining through our Commercial Streets program. And then in terms of mental health, we've been working with a local councilor to schedule a series of group zoom based counseling sessions for business workers and owners that we're hoping to launch in the new year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have also set up regular, consistent briefings with the county health department, and we've invited other Alameda County cities to join so that we can ask clarifying questions, we can share feedback from our businesses, and also just kind of help to spread the word about public health orders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as a result, in part from these meetings, the county health has moved to announcing changes in health orders, usually a couple of days in advance so that businesses have time to prepare. And the county has also worked closely with the state to clarify or to provide clarity around the difference between state and county guidelines when those'",
        "'speaker_0': 'are released. We've also been increasing our communication weekly, bi weekly emails to our businesses. We did a webinar to help provide businesses with assistance and tips on negotiating with their landlords under COVID 19. And finally, as a council as well, we placed a cap on the third party delivery fees for restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So rather than these 25 to 35% use, they're capped at 15%. And that cap went into effect a little over a week ago. Next slide. So in terms of next steps, we're here tonight to provide city council with an update and get your feedback and comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then we're working to develop strategies and put together a report during December and January. And we hope to be back in front of you in February or March for approval. So with that, I'm happy to take any questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. Thank you, Miss Piercy. And I just want to note that these regular briefings with county public health actually came about because of the initiative of our own Lois Butler, economic development director. And I know that because every other week there is a county public health briefing for elected officials.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And at our last briefing two weeks ago, Colleen Chawla, the director of the county health care services agency, announced that they are now doing these briefings for the economic development directors around the county. And then that was all initiated through the efforts of Alameda City of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think it's probably both. Lois but their enigmatic. Amanda But I think Lois, your name was even mentioned. And so that is not only to the benefit of our businesses, but also countywide. And we just really need to be making sure we're as proactive as we can be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is the information. Some of the information sharing really made a difference, like not announcing these changes to the county public health officers orders on a Friday when, you know, restaurants and venues like that had to struggle to, uh, to comply.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think this is really perfectly timed and personally perfectly timed item. Thank you so much for presenting it. Counsel We're being asked to accept the status report, but any comments or questions before we go on the air, before we vote?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then let me just ask really quickly, do we have some of the speakers on the side and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Have one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of my questions first? Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just had one quick question. I wonder if you could share a little bit about the, um, the business assistance program that the county just announced that I think the application deadline is closing at the end of the month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how are our businesses can kind of access more information on that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, absolutely. So Alameda County announced the Alameda County Cares Grant program. It opened yesterday. They're providing $5,000, one time grants to businesses located in Alameda County, unincorporated parts of Alameda County. As you mentioned, this closes at the end of the month.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've sent out we have it up on our website. We've sent it out in numerous locations, but I can try to grab the website to read off here if that would help. And folks can always contact us in economic development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can point them in the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have we done any work on that type of outreach in other languages? Because a lot of our businesses are owned by folks whose English is not their first language.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So the application provided by the county is available in multiple languages. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. And we are definitely sharing all of those all of those options.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for clarifying questions. Council Vice President, swing by.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Thank you very much. I appreciated this a lot. My my one question was, as I was reading The Bullet about experiencing a wave of small business closures, have we done any or considered doing any survey of our small businesses to kind of find out where they are?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Both. Are they even surviving? We just got a I just saw all these is on the risk of closing for good apparently according to the news tonight and kind of what their needs are like. Obviously, people are going to want to be a little careful.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I remember talking to businesses. Restaurants were opening over the summer and they were talking about how it's nice they're not making enough money to cover their costs. And they also have these 4 to 6 months of costs that they're going to have to pay back someday and kind of getting a better understanding of what the size'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and scope of that is so we can maybe make some survey. Question is, have we done are we going to be doing any survey of our smaller businesses, especially in our Main Street shopping areas?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's a great question. When we started this process way back in the spring, there had been a kind of a wave of surveys that had gone out around that time. And we looked at that data, but we were also hearing a little bit of survey fatigue, which I think is why we went more in the direction of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'focus groups and then also listening to people at our town halls. But I think I think that ongoing outreach is going to be really important to the strategy moving forward. Like we can't stop listening now. So I think incorporating a survey into it in the future is a great idea.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. It's great work. So thank you. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. And that's a great answer to Councilmember Avila.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So the website. The County Grant program is actually administered by the East Bay EDA. So the website is East Bay EDA boards back slash grants for anyone who's looking for that. But my question was, you know, I've noticed with a lot of these small business grants, for instance, with the city grants and then also with the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'county grants, it's for businesses and it caps them at 25 employees. One of the feedback things that has come up is particularly for daycares and preschools where they might have two locations on island or something like that. With the new COVID requirements, they are having to reduce the ratio of instructors to youth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that means in many cases, if you have more than one location, you're going to be exceeding the the the maximum number of employees to qualify. And so my question is, having gotten the feedback that that preschools and daycares are potentially threatened, have we looked at that or have we how have we responded or how are'",
        "'speaker_0': 'we looking at responding to helping those businesses stay afloat? So with the Alameda Strong grant, you can have two locations and up to 50 employees. The criteria for the East Bay Eddy County Grant was done without input from the cities and so we weren't able to influence that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But with the grants that we have going forward, hopefully we can. Have that additional requirement. One of the things that I did want to let you know is we have a council item coming December 1st, but I understand what that council item, it's for a matching grant from the county.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have to follow the county's criteria. And so we may not be able to include that criteria in with with the request that we will be making. So we can speak to that later. And I will follow up with the with the SBA, EDA, to see if we can shift that criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And have we do we have industry specific groups like are we. I guess my concern is I think that there's been a lot of outreach. And I know, Lois, you you've personally gone out and talked to businesses on Webster and Park Street, and so is your staff.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My question is, what are we doing and how are we reaching out to businesses that are not located in our business districts? So we have used our business license list to try to hit as many businesses as possible.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some businesses exclude their email address, and so we're not able to contact them. But if if they have listed their email address, they should be receiving an email from us when these announcements are being made. Also, through our focus groups, we've been able to contact additional folks and they have been passing the word as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for you, that's for rebels. Okay. Thank you. Miss Bella, would you say that the majority of our business license licenses do include an email address?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would say so, yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Because every day. Did I see your hair? No. Okay. Any further questions? Okay. I understand that we have a public speaker at least. Correct. The spacewalker.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She has lowered her hand. So I believe we do not have a public speaker now.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. No public speaker. Okay. All right. So any further discussion before we have recommended acceptance of this report tells everybody.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just moved to recommend the acceptance of the status report. There's a lot I'd like to say, but I also want to get onto the rest of the agenda. So. But thank you, Lois, you and your team for everything you've done.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. And so we can do this by a motion. A motion to recommend. Yes. So, yes. Yes. Okay, we're moving quickly, people. So that was seconded by Vice Chair. That's what I believe. Yes. I'm reading it as such.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A move by Councilor Brody, seconded by vice mayor. And that's why we have a roll.'",

This affects friends that I have in Alameda who would be here at public comment if this had taken place 3'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I. I promise. I do not think that everybody should go live in Alameda and nobody should living in Carmel. I think that we really have to coordinate together and it's sad that we have to get we have to essentially be forced by the state via the creative process to do what's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's especially sad. The state has been trying to do this since. I believe it. At least 40 years and they have to add all sorts of teeth to the law. To make this actually happen. I wish didn't come to this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I wish that we didn't have to be hostile with each other. But I honestly want the best for my friends, for my city, for the people I care about, for the region. That's why I'm I'm advocating for this.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I think this is an urgent matter. The was a decisive vote. But I think it's unclear what it means for the city. And I think it's important not to discuss these issues.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because could we pause the timer for one minute? Councilor Birthday said You might want to mute yourself and then you could make whatever editorial comment you'd like to make that we don't interrupt speakers and I won't let people interrupt you either.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. I'm pleased to present the clock. And Mr. Letterman, I'm sorry for the interruption. Please. Please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's perfectly fine. That's that's all I wanted to say, is that. Thank you for discussing this. And I support option two.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. All right. And then for digital tell, we have more speakers after this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That was the final speaker. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think. I'll just be brief. I think on November 3rd, the people of Alameda clearly said in no uncertain terms that they want to keep growth control measures like Measure eight, Article 26. They said that in no uncertain terms.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what that also means is that we're keeping measure A in the way that we're doing it right now. Measure A is in our it's embedded in our zoning. Right this every moment we live with Measure A and we live with two other things that in certain circumstances override it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The density bonus, the state density bonus law or the state housing overlay. So, you know, those things coexist. The idea that we can't build housing with measure a, the idea that we can't meet our regional housing needs, you know, to an electorate by planning commissioner from from the city of Campbell, from the heart of Silicon Valley, which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is causing the housing crisis on all of the Bay Area. When Silicon Valley catches a cold, sneezes, the whole of Bay Area catches a cold. The idea that we're going to get lectured by someone from the Planning Commission of of the city of Campbell, that we're not good residents, especially in the aftermath of a vote in which'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the outcome was quite decisive. If you're going to follow through on all this, you're basically undoing the vote of November 3rd. And that is not the role of planning staff. It's not the role of city council to undo the outcome.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We should just move along as we are right now, where we're working within the parameters of measure. Right now they're in our or at zoning and in as important. We're also meeting state housing law with regard to, you know, Bolton building multifamily housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're doing it through the density bonus. We're doing it through the multi-family housing overlay. That's why our our housing element was certified. Granted, there will be a new arena number, whether it's 4900 or whether it's 3200. At this point, the housing element is still certified.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It will be up to us to figure out how to meet the 3200 number or the 4900 number. And we all believe that the no on Z vote. Indicates that the city council should be going for the lesser of the two choices.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But whatever the number is, it will be upon the City Council to figure out how to meet the the arena numbers within the parameters that we have right now, which is measure eight as as instituted in our in our zoning ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's there already. And also working with the the density bonus as well as the state housing overlay. They coexist. And the vote of November 3rd was for for the residents to move forward and the status quo that we had.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have what they did not want, though, was to undo it, to unwind, remove, eliminate the growth control tool of Measure eight. That's what November 3rd was all about. And it was so overwhelmingly clear that people recognize that we're an island with limited constraints and we need such a tool like Article 26.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Cancer every day, side by side. That's why they sell your hand.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I just wanted to. Yeah, I hear in Councilmember de SACS comments, maybe a misunderstanding of what I'm proposing, because I'm not proposing. I agree with everything you just said, Tony. 100%. There is no such thing as a state housing overlay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That was something that the city of Alameda just made up and did. There was a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. That's not true. That's not true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wait, wait, wait, wait.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sorry, sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Council member is you. You still have time left. I will call on you, please. I know this is fairly emotionally charged. I get it. But we've got to get this done before midnight. So thank.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You both.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not looking to argue tonight. I'm just saying that what we're doing states, I guess just we should have a conversation about how we're going to move forward. Is it is it the use of overlays? You know, can we do that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we don't use overlays, how many housing units can be accommodated? Which should we use that to talk to abeg about what you're proposing, which is looking for a different a different in lower number. So that's the conversation I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not some let's have a conversation in December to overthrow a measure, throw overthrow the vote of the voters. I heard the voters very loudly. 40% voted yes and 59.87% said said no. 60. That is a decisive decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and I expect to honor that, you know, personally. And I will say it's going to be very difficult for me, to your point, to do things that just ignore that vote. So I'm not bringing this forward in any way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hear that you think that this is a this is some sort of ability to ignore the vote. I'm actually bringing this forward to say I believe we need to honor that vote and what does that look like?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we need to start having that conversation now while we can have conversations with a bang before things are settled so that we know where we stand by the end of that process. So that was all I want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilmember Vela. So your hand up, your next.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a few points, Madam Mayor. First is we have a code of conduct which we all voted on and agreed to. And I just think that we need to honor that code of conduct. And that includes the respect that we give constituents and people that call in to public comment and how we conduct ourselves at this meeting'",
        "'speaker_0': ', not speaking over each other. And so I feel it's very important to raise that point. Especially because on this item alone, I think there were three opportunities to perhaps abide by that code of conduct better. And it does not, in my opinion, reflect the values exhibited in our code of conduct or what we want to convey to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the public. Because I personally want to welcome public comment and public discourse, I think that there's a way that we can do it that is not abrasive or still taking input from others, even those that we disagree with.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I want to acknowledge that. I also want to acknowledge what I'm hearing. The number and the voting outcome is public. It's public record. We can we can view that. And I think that there's a lot of misinformation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I say that because I'm listening to some of the speakers that have called in tonight and at our last meeting. And and to me, yes, I think that the vote and the vote outcome was, quote unquote, decisive.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I think that there was a lot of misinformation and a lot of misunderstanding. So I do understand where the vice mayor is coming from in terms of clearing the air and addressing how how do we move forward?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What does this mean? What do these limitations rule? That said, going back to our code of conduct and as somebody who has faced a number of challenges and complaints and been accused of many things, I take very seriously our fiduciary obligation as council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do think that there will be a time to have that public conversation. But I think one of the things that's been very difficult has been that we haven't been able to have a conversation as a council with our executive staff, including the city attorney, to talk about kind of not not specific legal strategy, but the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'pros and cons moving forward from a fiduciary standpoint. And I would like to have that conversation. I understand the vice mayor wanting to bring this forward. What I'm hearing is trying to get together a timeline of how we can actually have these conversations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm certainly open to to that. I would like to at least what I would like to see is, is that this actually get agenda raised first on closed session for us to hear specifically from the city attorney. I know some of us have probably had more in-depth conversations than others, but I think that there is a value'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in having that closed session conversation where we can speak openly and honestly, ask our questions and concerns and get them on the record. What I'm very concerned about isn't necessarily a lawsuit per se from a specific developer. It's from some of our own constituents, some of the people that worked on that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For instance, even on the No on Z campaign that have named all of us individually and are in various lawsuits over the years, and that does come at a cost to the city. And it means resources from a staff level, and it means that we pay outside attorneys.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It means that we have staff spend endless hours going back and forth on these lawsuits when we should be moving forward in a proactive way, which is way I think the vice mayor is. His goal is and I certainly stand by that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I do think that there needs to be kind of an airing of what does this mean for the city, how do we do these things? And so what I would what I would like is to have a closed session.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not asking to delay this very long. I do think it's a conversation that we need to have fairly soon. I'd like to have the presentation from a bag and then I think having this publicly agenda raised would be helpful either at that same meeting or at the next meeting.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be something I would be open to because I do think that there's a valid point of clarifying What does this mean? What does this vote mean? How do these things interact? The last thing I want to say is it's really insulting to refer to Alameda as the island city because it ignores a whole portion of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our city that exists that is not on the island. And I think it's very exclusionary of a vast majority of our population that live in Bay Farm. The Harbor Bay Farm community deserves to be recognized as part of the city of Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They're on a peninsula. It actually used to be an island, but it became a peninsula when the island of Alameda, which was a peninsula, became an island. And so I think it's important to understand our history and to not just jump to but we an island.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because in reality, we have an island as. Part of our city. But we as a city are not just an island. I mean, I think it's important to recognize all of the people that make up our population. So I would just you know, I hear what people are saying relative to that, but that's only a portion of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Vela and Councilmember Odie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I appreciate my colleagues comments. I just do want to reiterate what Councilmember Abella just talked about. I mean, we we had a comment earlier in the meeting, remind us of our code of conduct. And it's pretty clear there that we all agreed and I assume we all signed, that we're going to agree to'",
        "'speaker_1': 'be welcoming to speakers and treat them with care and gentleness and not interrupt our colleagues when they're in the middle of of making a point. So, I mean, one time, okay. Two times, three times. I think it's something that the mayor needs to take up in in conjunction with the process outlined in the code of conduct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you can you can read the quote that's after that rule of somebody that said, the way the council treats people during public hearings can do a lot to make them relax or to push their emotions to a higher level of intensity.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, I mean, this was something that the grand jury asked us to do. And I think that the person that violated it was very insistent on following through with the grand jury. And, you know, the irony that it was violated three times tonight is not lost on me.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want to say that I appreciate the customer of the suggestion. You know, I think it's possible to combine a closed session where we actually hear some of the legal risks and then perhaps vote on waiving our privilege on that advice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then whatever we wait privilege on can be presented in the following open session right after that. You know, I was one of the people earlier in the year that said it's time to call the question on Measure Z.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Measure A, you know, I. Advocated for Measure Z. I put it on every piece of mail and and document that I put out in the campaign. And yet we lost. And it wasn't like a narrow loss. It was a convincing loss.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's not lost on me that, you know, 3/5 of our voters basically said, this is in our charter and we want to keep it in our charter. So I think it's imperative that we take a look at what that means for us as far as going forward with our housing element and going forward with ordinances that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we have passed that conflict with our charter, because there's always a talk in these meetings by some that the charter is the constitution of the city of Alameda and there's the Constitution of the United States of America. And if somebody passes a law that's in conflict with that constitution, then it can be held unconstitutional.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Yet we have passed laws and not this particular council, but other councils have passed laws, whether it be, you know, overlays and such that kind of get around measure a well, the public is basically told us we want to keep measure and it wasn't 5149, it wasn't 5545, it was basically 6040.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when these these ordinances were passed, we didn't have that reaffirmation from our electorate that this is something they wanted to do. And it wasn't a low turnout election. It wasn't a 12,000 vote special election. It was a 45,000 vote universal suffrage type of vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to me, it's pretty clear that the message that we're getting loud and clear is we want to have a ban on multi-family housing in Alameda and we want to have density limits that are in 26th Street. So we can't just ignore that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, whether we agree with them or not, we can't just ignore them. We have to learn how to deal with them. We have another just with them and we have to look and see if there's anything that we're doing that's in conflict with this charter provision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if it is, you know, to me it's, you know, unconstitutional or uncharitable or whatever the the phrase you want to you want to call. So I appreciate the vice mayor for bringing this up. You know, I feel duly chastised for my advocacy of of something different.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, I was on the wrong side. So when you're on the wrong side, you got to accept it. You know, I know Trump isn't doing that, but, you know, that's just the way it is. So I'm fully supportive of number two and with the caveat of Councilmember Avella suggestion that we had a closed session.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we can decide at that closed session what privilege we want to waive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Odie. Okay, so I have a few things to say with regard to the code of conduct. It does apply to all of us. And we did hear a speaker at the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Paul Foreman, go into detail about how he felt, about comments that were made to him.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I and I will go back and listen to that. That portion of the reference meeting. And I just want to remind all of us that we do our best work when we listen to each other. We are we all are people of strong views and we're passionate about what we do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's a good thing. But we we need to listen to everyone, even people we don't agree with sometimes, especially people we don't agree with, because we can we can spend too much time in an echo chamber and not realize that there are other views out there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and I've done a lot of soul searching about Measure Z myself, having co-chaired the campaign with the vice mayor. And, you know, I think and then the theme of communication came up when we were discussing the Oakland Alameda Access Project, and that is to say crossing bridge.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there was a lot of just misinformation and miscommunication that was swirling. So we are elected leaders. We represent our city, and we always want to make our city proud that we are the leaders. So regardless of how you feel about what someone is saying, we we strive to treat people the way we would want to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'treated. And and and yet I'm the first one to acknowledge that it's tough. You know, we're not we're not robots. We have feelings. We get frustrated. And it's tough to keep those emotions in check sometimes, but we need to continually work toward it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and I think, you know, reach out and and acknowledge and maybe have a conversation with someone who might have felt wrong by something you said or did. The other thing is very interesting discussion. And yes, I am bringing forward we will have a presentation on the reading methodology for determining our allocation of housing numbers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this process is working its way through ABEG. And as we speak, I get a little nervous as an attorney when I hear that we should just waives the attorney client privilege and discuss legal things out in the open.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would never want to have that discussion without asking our city attorney's input or opinion on it. And I would just say, from my perspective, I think it can be a slippery slope that, yes, we say we we waived this privilege this time, but then what about the next time?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And who gets to decide that? City Attorney Mr. Evenson. May I call upon you to just share and share your thoughts? Impart some wisdom to us which should please this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Also, I'm happy to share what.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We plan on doing and having shared process as what we are planning to do is to prepare a confidential memo outlining the various legal implications to the counsel, and we expect to provide that to the counsel this month.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the counsel will have it in advance of any future council meetings. The counsel can digest it and consider whether any portion of, for example, any portion of the memo it would like to waive and and be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Shown to the public. That's certainly the council's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Call where we're here to provide legal advice to the counsel. And if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's any provision in any part of the memo, it will be at least.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Concrete. And the counsel can look at it and decide what is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to the extent the counsel would like to have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A closed session, I'm happy to talk about that with the counsel. We, as you know, the states, as we probably would agenda as it is anticipated litigation, the city's initiation of litigation. And we probably will need a little more factual development before we bring it to you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we we will not be expecting to bring that to you in December. We may bring it to you in the coming year after you've had the opportunity to digest our memo. And maybe here Planning Director Thomas's background presentation to you in December and when you have a little more information so that the Council can make an'",
        "'speaker_1': 'informed decision. I've got to answer your question. I'm happy to answer anything specific.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now that that is very helpful. And thank you for that. And Councilor, we're going to have to act quickly because we only have 3 minutes before we have to adjourn according to our vote. So I would I would like to see is that this is the sequence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would suggest just my suggestion coming forward to us in the first meeting in December, the presentation by a bank staff on recent allocations sometime in the near future. Getting that memo from city attorney on his legal opinion about these matters deciding it's a little unclear to me how the council would go about deciding whether to vote'",
        "'speaker_3': 'or whether whether we want to release all or part of that. That can be determined. But then to get a closed session scheduled for, I think as soon as the city attorney feels like he would reasonably have the opportunity to get whatever facts together he needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we hear this item first in closed session, which I think is what Councilmember Vela was suggesting. But Vice Mayor and that's why I'm going to hand the floor to you, because you this is your this your item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, well, you know, I'm I'm happy to to join my colleagues in moving whatnot forward. I would be a little concerned. We believe now that the methodology has been approved, add a bag and whatever else. We have a six month comment window that ends in June.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would want to I do believe that we have heard from a not insignificant portion of our community, not necessarily the same portion that voted no on Z, but but that they have questions and interests in that in looking at the arena allocation and having conversations about that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would like to make sure that whatever process happens that maybe in January we are able to start having kind of the conversations about how to move forward. So again, I personally, you know, I would like to I would love to start and I think it would be good for our community because, you know, to the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'conversation I had with Councilmember de Song, I think there's a lot of misinformation out there about intention and what we're doing and whatnot. So I think the quicker we start, you know, kind of just talking through these things, I think that people will calm down a little bit and feel more comfortable again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that was not a comment about Councilmember Sang. I just meant in the community, people are, I think, feeling tense. You know, I think Councilmember Odie has a lot of a lot of history here and could or just participate in that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, I would also recommend that we create space for the incoming councilmember as well to have conversation in that as well in December. That would be my recommendation is making sure that that space is okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilmember Day So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just want to say quickly that I was the campaign manager and what that meant was I wrote the political mail, I wrote the first draft of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is now midnight. We voted to go to midnight. I believe we've had recommendations to the staff for moving forward. That fair assumption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is, I don't know. Is there is there a motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We yes, we had a motion so until midnight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So what does that mean?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It means we've had staff direction. I think the vice mayor laid out a pretty solid path.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff, do you feel you have enough direction, Mr. Thomas, position moving forward? I'm seeing a nod from Mr. Sharon. A thumbs up. Okay. All right. Council member Odie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can we move to extend the meeting another 5 minutes to kind of wrap this?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And just this item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm happy to defer my ten A to the next meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because you know my policy about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I understand that would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be good that I'll move that we extend the meeting 5 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. It's 5 minutes starting the minute the vote is taken and I'm timing correctly. Okay. Really? And it's been moved by. I'm sorry. It wasn't looking up, was it, early next week?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, it it in that order and maybe have a roll cover, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilmember de SAC i naxalite ody i. Vela i. Mayor as the Ashcraft.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'High.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That carries by five eyes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Fucking continuous as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I'm going to start the timer. Just. Man, I missed you just one minute to try to find you. Talk to one minute, because then we get our 5 minutes. Yeah. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ready?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Three days to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go. So I was the campaign manager. I wrote the political mail. I wrote it, I designed it. I earned or acted with John Diaz, with the Chronicle. I ran, interacted with Dan Borenstein of East Bay Times, with J.K. Deneen, the staff writer of Chronicle as well as the radio station Cale LW.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And even when you look back at the discussion with the Harbor Bay Isle folks at all points in time, the message was never, we don't want to build multi-family housing. The message was simply, we want to keep Article 26 and we recognize that we are building multifamily housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Look at our political mail, our political mail. Show the multifamily housing that we're building. So we understood that the density bonus and the housing overlay were a fact of life that we have to live with. However, we're at it scenes with the fact that we've got Article 26 embedded in the environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilor Odie, were you I think maybe you were speaking.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here, I mean. It says what it says. I mean, it says we're not allowed to build multi-family housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we're looking for direction moving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I would like to make a motion to adopt moving forward with item alternative two of the referral and direct staff to have it come back at the December 1st meeting. Because I mean, I would like to have some part of the discussion before before leaving.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Knowing that it's not going to be an end all, be all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that discussion could take place in the under the. The item on the reading methodology.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's fine with the refer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We should refer. Yes. Okay. Is that all right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's all. Yeah. That was my intent, was to have them together. So we're not having two separate conversations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is happening on December 1st. Okay. Correct. Anything further in the 3 minutes we have left? Okay. Mr. Chan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to confirm.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That the direction is not for us to bring a closed session item on December 1st.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's only to have open session.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Conversations combined with Mr. Thomas's staff report.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct? Correct. And then we're going to see a legal memo from you at some point in the future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that open session conversation will not be waiving any privilege.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To clarify.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Absolutely see how it can based on this discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So with 2 minutes left, so we had a motion by Councilmember OTI and I think it's been clarified that this is going to be discussed in the December to December 1st.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The first is that remedy is. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sticking with the theme, I'll second that motion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Here we go. The dynamic duo. Okay. We've had a motion. It's been seconded by the usual suspects. May we have a roll call vote, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Remember de.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thug?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not quite.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Odie, I avella I may or as the Ashcraft High that carries 4 to 1.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, everyone. There's a minute and 36 seconds left, but I think I should probably just tell you a thank you. A lot of good topics, tough topics were discussed tonight and so continuing. Thanks for all your good work and please just be extra careful when you're out and about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Remember your your masks and all the things we need to do to protect ourselves and others from COVID 19. Okay. Take care. Stay safe. Thank you, Staff. Awesome work as usual. And I see you with the owls. And good.'",
