    "Contract Award for On-Call Civil Engineering Consulting Services.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'And recommendation to award a one year contract with the option of four year extensions for an amount not to exceed 150,000 each for the following companies VF K Harrison, Engineering Shop and Wheeler or Uncle Civil Engineering.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't know who pulled the item.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I did.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, all right, everybody. Did you want to go ahead? Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I guess I kind of wonder if we can do CND kind of together, because I think the questions and answers are kind of the same. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do you want to call me? I mean, if.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I could call five C and five G at the same time, then.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. So we'll hear both of those at this time, and then you can go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I guess I'm curious about trying to understand the numbers a little more clearly so we could have. One in $50,000 per year. Per contract. So on the first one, that's three contracts, right? So that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it could be up to 450 per year. And then times three. So that could be like 1.2 or 1.3 million or whatever it turns out to write.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Actually, first of all, my name is Abdulhamid. I'm with Public Works Department and the estimate is really what we have. That 150,000 per contract per instrument.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you could be sure to speaking to the microphone, everyone will be able to hear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The contract amount. It's just an estimate. It will be a would actually be awarded based on as needed. So. So we don't anticipate using the contract amount, you know, the you know, the full contract amount per year. It just as, you know, as needed basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I got that. But I'm just trying to understand what our maximum exposure is. So, I mean, over the course of the five year. Contract or potential five year contract. What the exposure is for like Bcfe High Scharf and Wheeler.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then again on item five DX there's four contracts. So I mean to me if I run the numbers, you know, it's in the millions and I just wonder. You know, I just wonder if we have a better estimate on how much we're going to spend, because it seems awfully open ended.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then if we're spending, you know, four or five, $8 million on on call engineering, you know, why are we not doing that in house? Because that seems like a lot of money at worst case.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. You're right. But first of all, both items, item C and D are actually for two different professional services. One is for civil engineering, and then the other one is for structural engineering. And and then we have three consultants for item C, which is the professional services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then four item D is for structural engineering. And we got we selected four consultants. So really they are kind of different services. But the amount, what we're asking for is 150 maximum per year. And so for the second year, for example, third year, fourth year, we will bring the contract back to the City Council for approval'",
        "'speaker_4': 'before we award or execute the contract.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, so most of these contracts, it only 10% is covered by the general fund from past practice and it's either covered by the project that has been done and funded by other sources or by developers. Correct. Correct. So it's as far as an impact to taxpayers or the general fund, it's minimal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And I guess my other question my last question would be, so we're doing I appreciate you clarifying that. C is for civil engineering and D is for structural engineering. So why are we going to three different firms?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there some special expertize that we can't get from one particular firm or or in any other case for firms?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, both actually, areas the civil engineering, professional, civil engineering and structural are two different fields in the engineering arena, let's say. So for the structural, it's really well defined and also the licensing, it's different than the civil engineer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I get that. But within let's okay, let's just take civil first. We have three different contracts. So is there something that one of these firms does that the other one doesn't, that we have to have three contracts?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It will give us more, I guess, a wide range of expertize. So if we're not happy with one, then we could actually not continue awarding the contract to them. You know, then we'll have more options with, you know, with different consultants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And usually that's also the standard practice with other, you know, cities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I appreciate your answers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the minimal impact to the general fund is within the city budget, but we have a two year budget. And so why are we executing a five year contract? I mean, you said you're going to come back to us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So why is that? Why is the staff report for a five year contract?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're giving the range of five years, but actually will awarding, you know, with an option of renewing it on, you know, on a yearly basis up to five years, which also we bring back to city council for approval.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And what happens if we don't use their services? How much money do they get for being on zero?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nothing. Okay. Yeah, it's as the needed basis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is just that we would be using them as a service, but not that they're getting paid. Like some places you have to pay a retainer in order to correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. Actually, they will be like on a standby without using their services unless there's a need for it. So it will not touch the budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Any other questions from council? I have a question. How many engineers do we have on staff? Structural and civil.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have any structural engineers on staff, but we do have just civil engineers. And we have, if I'm not mistaken, I think we have only two licensed civil engineers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So this has been a question from the public in the past of why couldn't we have more engineers that are actually staff that would be possibly more available to the public when they come here to work with on getting their permits as opposed to having.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'My understanding is that the project and it could help possibly facilitate expediting the permits instead of having to wait for the documents to be sent to a consultant and then come back. That impacts the quality of service.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a valid question, but I guess the answer really I will look at it is this way. If you look at it as like Kaiser, the health care, you know, it's a big health care center. You know, if you need a specific like if we need to see a heart surgeon and then we will go to a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'separate clinic just asking for that expertize. So. And the second thing is really for a full time employee, it's really kind of hard to get rid of versus if you have a consultant, if you're not happy with their services, you could just not renew their contract or eliminate their services.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And by having a stable of civil engineers and structural engineers, we as the economy increases or we have a blip in our applications, we have that this contract already available. And it's quick to do just a cost estimate for the developer or for the project rather than having a full time permanent position.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As Abdellah said of my specialty.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like I'd like to finish my question. I didn't realize you were you. So. Do you think it's possible to look into trying to expedite that submit? My understanding is that is a problem that I've heard complaints that it takes it adds days or if not weeks to of getting a permit by sending it off to a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'consultant. Is there is that something that we can look into in trying to expedite that turnaround time?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can look into that. It's community development and sort of. Correct. So. We can look into it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you. Member Ashcroft.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And the comment that I was going to make is that I think we always have to keep the bottom line in mind. And if we hire engineers for our staff for then paying purrs and benefits and all those things that we're trying to get a handle on, whereas I see this as the best of all'",
        "'speaker_5': 'worlds, these are very reputable engineering firms, two different specialties as as Mr. Abdullah has noted, and they're on call to us when we need them. We can certainly look at the turnaround time, but I think this is much more fiscally responsible and yet efficient for the city vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How much have we spent on outsourcing the engineering work over the past two fiscal years?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't have an answer for that, but I could get that information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'How did we get to the number of $150,000 per year for each engineering firm?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I really. Unfortunately, our city engineer who worked on the staff report, you know, and also the interviewing the consultant is not available tonight to answer that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Do we need to have these approved tonight? Is there a reason that these but these have to be approved tonight? Well, we.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could delay if we don't have a contract coming in. It's it's also subject to budget approval. And so if this council wants to lower it in outgoing years, this says it's up to, you know, council approval. But I think it would be helpful to have where the estimates have come from and what we've spent there based on'",
        "'speaker_1': '. It's a every five years we come back to council and it's 50,000 a year. This is a it's a renewal of what our past practices. I understand that. I'd just like to understand, I think, what the actual numbers are.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what's the pro forma in terms of what we've actually spent for each one of these firms over the past budget cycle, like over the last two year budget cycle? What if we could we could the council I mean, this is a full council decision, but if we need to get this approved tonight, can we do it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'for one year and come back as an option?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I swear to you, I'm sorry. Member matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My understanding is it's coming back every year anyway. Right. So I'm going to move approval of this. We're not spending 150,000. Correct. We're authorizing a contract up to. And if we don't approve this, we're going to stall public works projects and we will get a chance the budget time at the midyear and at the next cycle to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'also look at this and look at the run against that. So I move C and D.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is there a second? I second I have another question. Does this mean that we currently do not have engineers working for us, that their contracts have lapsed? In which case, but was.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In anticipation of it lapsing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When and when does it lapse?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It does not. I mean, there is no need right now for the special teams, luckily. So it just just in case if there's a need for a structural engineer or a civil engineer, then we will have the existing contract with these consultants.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But luckily, we don't have any need right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we don't currently have a contract on a consulting basis with a structural engineer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is for the stable of engineers to use as projects come in, development projects come in and capital projects.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's the $57 million that we have. And then, you know, in the next two years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And again, this isn't general fund dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I appreciate that. All right, Vice Mayor, I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think the question is, and I would also like an answer to it is if a project comes in right now, is there a firm that we go to right now and when is that ability going to end?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we have a project right now, most of current consultants that we have and this is just a guess, you know, that we exhausted their contract, which there is a limit on their contract. So if there's any work, we have to come back to city council, you know, and award the contract to a consultant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But prior to that, we have to advertise and solicit proposals from consultants. So we're talking about three months delay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we don't have this thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is there any reason we couldn't just pass this until the mid-year budget review and then have the contract expire then and look at this item again then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're just again, just a reminder, this is a contract. There's no money involved in this contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There is possibly if we use the services. All right. So that's the concern. I believe that's the concern is that, yes, at some point it does legally obligated us to paying money. That's why you're here, I believe. So I'm only.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want clarification. I think the city manager made an excellent suggestion about maybe we just do it one year, but is that what we would do anyway because we have the option for or one year extensions or not.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'd like to have more information on this specifically like the vice mayor asked, you know, how much we've actually used for these services in the last couple of years so we can kind of judge it. But I also don't want to hold up, you know, the one year contract over that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I don't know if there's some middle ground where we could do both. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we'd be more than glad actually to provide that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Looks like maybe the city attorney, acting city attorney might be coming up with something better.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mayor. Remember, just to clarify, if I'm understanding this correctly, this comes back every year for renewal. We will have the opportunity each time to look at this, correct?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, we were actually we just pulled off the contract. Mm hmm. And the agreement may be mutually extended on a year by year basis, up to four additional years at the sole discretion of the public works director based on it, at a minimum, satisfactory performance and subject to Budget Council approval at the Budget.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So come back to us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So in that case, I will modify my motion to say comes back to the council yearly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So in essence, you'd be authorizing a contract for just one year with no extensions? No to have five years. But it comes back to the council every year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For that approval. And I will second again the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Timely so at.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The discretion of the city council instead of any discretion of the public. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think so, yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vice Mayor and I would also at the time if if we could have a friendly amendment at the time that this is presented to the Council, that the expenditures to date and also for the last fiscal cycle be included.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Except in the report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor I passed unanimously and member Ashcroft was a second on that I. All right. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Recommendation. Authorize the city manager to enter into a one year agreement with bar architect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I pulled this one, too. I had a quick question on this one. I mean, if we approve this and we go down the path of spending almost 200,000 to prep for a technology campus, I mean, are we shutting the door to possible use of the BQ for any residential or dormitory or housing type purpose?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That would be a decision.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'By the City Council. We'd come to you to do the RFP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We did have quite a few discussions during the Main Street.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Where the housing might be and centralize again, centralizing it in the Main.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Street neighborhood, but it doesn't preclude it. You could do pretty much whatever you like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Because I mean, I the way I understand it, if there's certain units like they don't have kitchens, for example, like a dormitory wouldn't have a kitchen and those wouldn't count against the cap. Right. I guess my concern is if we're doing this, are we shutting down the possibility of of using that for some type of housing'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And so we're just starting to look at some of those other buildings out there that haven't been activated. And we've been really successful with some of the more low hanging fruit that the hangars. But at this point, we have to start looking at other options.'",

But there are certain things that seem to be remarkably the same as what the last report said, and especially when I look at the table that has the deliverable tasks and the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'results, the results basically that the tasks were, you know, what what was done, not the results. It talked about 65, 65 people or what does it say, inquiries. What were the results of of that? Do we have any anybody who has interests beyond inquiry?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other point that I wanted to make on here is that if we're doing the same thing and we're only getting 65 for the number of activities like broker presentations, mailers, phone follow ups. What do they call this email blast?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If we keep doing the same thing and we're only getting a little response, what are we going to try and look and see why people aren't responding? That was the second thing a little more. A little more innovation than seeing the same kind of report every every six months or every every year.'",

We seem to have other traction outside of city where two buildings have actually been sold. And that should be. You know, the public relations effort is being in the regional press being held up for Saturday, groundbreaking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We just sold two buildings and they're being repurposed. I would think that is public relations effort worthy. And we should make a big deal out of that. Also, I'm looking at the financial impact. It says there is no financial impact to the city general fund or the base reuse fund budgets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, we just sold two buildings, so there's got to be a financial impact there. How much were they sold for? The report doesn't say that. And where is the money going? And we have infrastructure needs that are being ratcheted up because of failures in the sewer systems and failures in the water delivery systems that we may have'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to foot the bill for. So I'd like to see a little more meat around that rather than a it looks like a cut and paste line that says there's no financial impact when you lead off saying that. We we sold two buildings and people need to know that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think this is super critical that we're moving ahead with the enterprise district in spite of city's problems. And people are asking about that, what's going on. And I'd really like to see a bigger splash on this.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Right. That goes to my concern that I think actually Mr. Ernst has been successful at coming up with projects that are approved palladium as a long term tenant out there. And I think Cushman Wakefield job is in fact to bring new people to business interests and end up with deals being made.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And Michelle and I was going to make a comment that those those transactions and building data as well have been our staff and there's a lot of money that is coming in. To those buildings based on what staff is has negotiated and what we voted on here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those. And this is not a Cushman Wakefield report. This is a job creation and development report at the base. So again, I think it's got to be meaty and it's got to be public so that the public knows that something is going on.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I think this isn't totally worth it. It's actually a in the scope of things too little. But we have to do something. And I actually witness the Operation Dignity mobile van at Lucky and Marina Village interacting with three of our regular homeless residents in the Marina Village area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was very impressed with the outreach and it I think it's going to take that. I stopped and listened for a while and then I talked to the Operation Dignity guys. And there's they're creating a relationship with these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know these individuals by sight. They're connecting with them. And it it seemed to be going positive. And I talked to them later. They they try the the Operation Dignity staff tries to get a trust factor in place so that people will trust them to connect them to services.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know also that they did outreach to the homeless camp that was being developed behind the the portal of the Webster tube. And just before the rains hit. I think they've addressed that. So this is money well-spent and I'm full support of it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Remember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, madam. I concur with my colleague. I do wish there were ways we can do more on this issue. I don't have a solution to the homeless problem, but what I do know is that individualized case management seems to be the most effective way to get as many people off the street as possible.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Do you want me to just answer questions or give you a little bit of background?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, the title, for instance, starts with adoption of resolution authorizing preliminary and conditional commitment of 500,000 of public education and government peg fee funds for 1 to 1 match with Alameda Unified School District Career Technical Education Facilities Program Grant Application to establish a Community Media Center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to clarify that the what the ask here is that the city contribute 500,000 from these PEG funds. And then what is this? And that is not a dollar for dollar match with the school district. It's actually the school district would be obtaining a grant and then those monies would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But are the city that peg funds would be matching? So I wanted to clarify that. So the public understands the ask and there may be another.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And I would just ask maybe from a little broader perspective, as long as we've pulled this item in, it really is an important community asset. So perhaps Miss Hope could give an overview of of what this is all about, in addition to answering the specific questions posed by the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So you're right that that's what the ask is, is the PEG funds, the $500,000 a peg funds is a 1 to 1 match for the grant that Alameda Unified School District is is applying for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what are our peg funds?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh. So peg funds. Back in 2006, the ordinance, which stands for digital infrastructure and video compliance, went into it went into effect. Yes. And with that, the city was was actually in a position to now receive franchise fees as well as peg funds.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So over the years, the city has collected about $800,000 specifically for peg funds, which can only be used for capital and equipment purposes. And PEG stands for Public Public Education Government Fund. Yeah. So we've done a good job meeting the education and government needs using our PEG funds.'",

There's been a lot of conversation, a lot of community interest of establishing like a nonprofit to actually manage the Community Immediate Media Center. They've been successful with the Alameda Radio program having community involvement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So as we designed the area and figured out what the actual needs were for Community Media Center Center, Felicia Vargas, who's actually dropped drafted the grant application from Alameda Unified, brought together industry experts, as well as a consultant who works with different cities to establish a community media centers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, thank you. And I wanted to go to our city clerk. I know there was a statement that, well, it's my understanding these are funds that can also be used to upgrade the sound that are. And we do get complaints that actually people cannot hear us, that the mikes are not necessarily the best mikes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to the long term plan of making sure that the city has a, you know, a proper equipment here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. That the city is not giving away the full amount of the fund. We are keeping money back. And there are, in fact, projects that we're looking into right now. Unfortunately, you've seen me struggle with a little remote because our touch panel has broken.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I can't control the projector from our touch and anymore. So we're getting those redone and we're looking into a new projector and, you know, constantly setting aside money for all of that will be covered. And, you know, the equipment does unfortunately break and then does need to be replaced.'",

I know we're going to hear more about the opening of that later today. And then there's another 200,000 per year, is it, of pet funds that could be allocated toward other efforts?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. We average over the last three years and we've collected 220,000 on average per year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And again, when you say collected, this is from the bills of Internet or cable. Cable TV.'",

I'm a parent to young children who attend U.S. schools, and I'm an independent film and video producer, as well as professional musician as well.

The textbook sort of a definition would be any form of media that is created and controlled by the community, either by a geographic community or a community of identity or of interest.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So being that we are an island community, we have a very unique cultural identity, I feel we have a very strong and lively community that is a strong voice and is always looking for new ways to share their thoughts, ideas, opinions and a community media center was a perfect place for that because it is a it's a'",

We currently have it in the afternoons and in the evenings on weekdays and completely 24 hours on the weekends. We share it with the jewelry channel, but we are looking to get four complete hundred percent access.'",

And as some of you know, I'm also executive director for Communications, Public Information and Media at the Project Community College District.'",

It's been providing educational career opportunities for students and media access to the public. In many ways, it's a model of what we're being what's being proposed here between with the Alameda Community Media Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. I knew this was going to happen. I've also worked to create a dual enrollment broadcast communications course with internal high school, where students at NC now can take broadcast classes at both College of Alameda, where they have the radio station and also sorry, at Encino High and at College of Media using our radio station so they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'can receive both high school and college credit. And I see this proposed community media center as a natural continuation of this effort. It will provide Alameda students with career technical education. The broadcast field and housing IT at Alameda High School is an ideal location since you already have the radio station audience now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's going to be nice to have something over there at Alameda High and it will allow the current program there, which is an award winning program, thanks to John. I mean, he's done amazing stuff and it will provide them with state of the art broadcast facilities and a way to to use the latest technology, which will give'",
        "'speaker_4': 'them the hands on experience they're going to need to get out there in a career. Importantly, too, and I think this this is this is going to affect you guys. I think the construction of this CMC would allow the city to improve the quality of your own governmental broadcasts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The audio of the council meetings and other meetings would be improved. In fact, I went out there and listened in the outer room, You need some help? Okay. Yeah. Sorry. Anyway, so we could, you know, that that would be part of this project improving, that we could also help improve the distribution of programing, produce other programing, get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'it out more widely throughout the city and other channel and other and other media. The city would have a remote capability too, so that all manner of government programing from anywhere could be broadcast. But here's the thing. Moreover, Alameda High School students would learn to eventually hold jobs at the CMC and help produce programs.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I believe so much in this concept and I've been helping pro-bono to help, you know, do some of the consulting on and stuff like that. I truly believe it's a win win win for our students who will obviously get the career technical education, training for the public, who will finally have media access in Alameda and to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the city, which will be able to finally have a state of the art broadcast facility to help people know what you guys are doing. So thank you for considering it. And I appreciate your. Yes.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But also for the county.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Thank you for saying that, because I didn't really want to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that is that I do that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As Mayor Spencer said, I'm also just a month ago, I was recognized as the Alameda County Teacher of the Year. And I just as a sidebar, I wanted to thank you, Mayor Spencer. I was one of 18 teachers in the county as candidate for this award, and you were the only mayor to offer accommodation for for this'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And I really appreciate it. And then I didn't know if you also know and I again, I'm embarrassed to say this, but I was two weeks ago, I have been named the United Nations Global Citizen of the Year with the theme of education for all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't need a combination.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was going to say I could do another commendation for you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm here to tonight to support this effort. And I'm not I'm not going to take it from the TV side because I may take it from the radio side and show how a joint venture works with the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am also a resident. My son goes to internal high school. I work collaboratively with John. The ventures that we have done together have been a joint effort from Alameda High and it's now we are here for kids in the community and we serve it at both ends and we see us all as unified, not as one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or the other. I am also I'm here to show that that the radio side works. And again, I'm a I'm a radio guy. I spent 25 years doing morning radio in San Francisco before I became a teacher. I have the face for radio, so that's why I went there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But the this joint venture works. Six years ago, I worked with a group of members from from the Alameda and I worked with Alameda Community Radio. And together we apply a two year working relationship of applying for a joint license from the FCC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We got that. We collectively worked together, built the studios, built the transmitter. And on March six, 2017, we started our first live broadcast broadcasting to the community of Alameda. And this joint effort could not have worked with a bunch of a group of educators and a group of community members coming together to serve the Alameda community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want you to say that I want I'm here to say that it works brilliantly. It works collaboratively. It's good for kids and it's good for the city. And I can't think of another next step as to doing this venture, this joint venture at Alameda High.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I can't wait to bring our kids and our TV guy colleagues and working with Paul and bring in our kids to be a part of this venture. It is an exciting time and this is an exciting time for the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I really, really hope that we can work and collaboratively do this together because Mayor Spencer and Councilwoman Ashcroft have seen the radio station in action and see how amazing it is and how these kids broadcast and how the community comes together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for being so supportive of that, and I hope that you will continue to support this next effort because it's good for all of us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I just want to add, vice mayor was also there at the radio station, Nanette Dietz, to give her credit.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'From the time I was 11, my first teacher was Buddy Ebsen and his wife, Nancy. So I am very honored to be here, and I so support this project. I have a program myself called Celebrating Native America, and I have been trying so hard for a long time to get it made, but it's very difficult to go'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So I need all the help I can get from our wonderful students, from the community. And it's here in Alameda. There's so much talent here, not only among the students, but within the community that I would love to see all of our programs on cable television out there so that our many voices from many different backgrounds can'",

And I think that this is a project that I know I, for one, and my Native American community here would very much like to see I've already been offered and people reached out from United Indian Nations offering theirs their interns, and they said, we'll even pay them if you let them come and help you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I said, Wow. Okay. So I mean, there's a lot of support from everywhere, is my point. And I think that this is the city that really should go ahead and do that. And thank you very much for letting me speak.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'And I wouldn't have guessed that because Mr. Gorham does an amazing job with his students. He's always trying to show them various career opportunities. And in April, my daughter, who is with the State Department and currently in Cairo, was home for a visit.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so Mr. Gorham arranged for her to speak to his government in U.S. history classes. And but we got there a little early. So we one of the students took us to the radio station and we got to listen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You would have thought you were in a professional radio station. They were so polished. And now I just found out they'd only been in operation a month or so. So very amazing. And it's just it is so true.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think a number of us have attended the career fair that the school district in the city put on every year, and it just keeps getting bigger and better. And what we're trying to do is give these students this career, experience and training before they even get to college.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to help them or whatever they do. Not everybody's headed for a four year college. Maybe you're headed for a vocational program. It's great. But we want you to be trained. You've got to be competitive and there's so many skills out there, skill sets to develop.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm wholeheartedly behind this. And then when you talk about the space at Alameda High, I'm an Alameda High graduate from a long time ago, and I know the industrial arts building, my homeroom is there. But also back when I was going to high school, the guys took shop and the gals took home EC and I'",
        "'speaker_5': 'would have loved to have been in there doing woodworking, but I it's great to see that space repurposed and for such a current and forward thinking kind of a space. And it was brought up, I think in, in some of the speakers that because these are programs for students, there are certain laws that have to be observed'",
        "'speaker_5': 'in. So they're needed. It needs to be a separate entrance for students and for the public. They can't co-mingle. There needs to be a separate restroom and all that is either there or is being adapted to be done.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think this is a wonderful use of these funds and and and the remainder is going to go to useful purposes to help in this city. So I can't wait to support this. Thank you all for coming out and sharing your stories.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Wonderful member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. And I have a couple quick questions who I directed. So. I mean, for one, we had an all star cast speaker, so I'm not going to vote no on this, but I just have some ideas and some questions going forward.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is, I think, a very appropriate use of these PAC funds to to build this facility. But know what happens after it's built. I mean, like, who pays for the maintenance? Is that a school district thing? Is that a city thing?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well. So and those are the details. If it does get awarded, then what we will probably do is contract with the consultant that Alameda Unified School District worked with to work out those details. And we would also see how other cities do it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Like I said, you can't can't use peg funds for operations, but there's other ways to actually staff like creating a nonprofit, having membership dues to help support. So there's different models that we would explore at that time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Because I guess my concern is, you know, we don't have a crystal ball, so we don't know. But, you know, the the last time the last big thing we had with the school district on funding something, the pools, I mean, there always seems to be a tug of war.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who's going to pay those? Want us to pay even though it's on their property and they get primary use. And this is an amazing program and it prepares students at an earlier age than than college. And, you know, those are the unfortunately, the type of things that districts cut first.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I would just like to make sure that if if when we do come up with some long term, you know, plan on how to do this, that we make sure that this stays because I mean, it's it's it's super needed and super critical.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think it's exciting for the students that can actually take advantage of it. And I hate to see it, you know, get the ax the first time, you know, the school district comes around and then we have this huge empty space that we paid, you know, money for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, it's just sitting there idle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So and those are the details that would be part of the joint use agreement, similar to internalize a shared pool agreement. It will be coming to council and it will be conducted. Arts Council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will also be supporting this. I think one of the speakers noted this is a win win win. I agree. I think it's also a much needed first step. But I do want to make sure that we're putting in appropriate resources towards making sure that operationally this stays put and that it's funded as it needs to be'",
        "'speaker_1': 'funded so that we really do make it a sustained kind of win, win win for everybody involved. And so, you know, I think we have a lot of different community partners. I'm looking forward to hearing more about that when staff comes back.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank. The stuff from a USB that came out and really has supported this. Mr. DALTON. Mr. GORE. And then I also want to thank Mr. Heyman for being part of this and the work that you do at the college.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of course, we have our community partners that we work with all the time, and this to me is exactly the work that we want to do as a city with the school district for the benefit of not only the students, but also the community at large.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is I know something that people have been asking for for a long time. Just like the radio station. And honestly, I'm just going to tell you, I'm very proud to be mayor during the time that we will be moving forward on both of these huge efforts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I do want to thank our staff for working on this school district staff, and then I am confident that we will and I do wish the district the best in getting this grant. I think that will be huge.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that, of course, will work. We will work well together to continue it and make it and make it work somehow.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'With that mayor, I would love to make the motion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Back and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All those in favor. My motion carries unanimously. Thank you all for coming out on that item. Then I believe that that. I believe that that completes our consent calendar. So now we're on. Like I said in the on the there were some people here on the cannabis issues five that won.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The vote was 3 to 2 with member matter SC and member Ashcroft voting No. Five K passed unanimously. Correct. Right? Right. All right. So now we're moving on to so those of you that are here for that, you don't want to hang out longer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can. Otherwise you're dismissed than happy Thanksgiving. Next six, a.'"

        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to thank counsel for allowing this to be moved forward. It was not her last time, and I actually submitted this referral back on October 11th. And it and I think it's very important. So the ask is, the members of the public have expressed concern over what appears to be an increase in crime in the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'city. Consider directing staff to provide a public update on crime within our city. That includes trends. What the city is doing. And what additional steps can be taken to reduce or thwart criminal activity. And council could consider also holding a workshop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I also submitted today another referral that's very related to this asking council to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can we talk about something that's not on the agenda? I believe the city attorney is indicating we cannot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, so part of this referral actually says to consider.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You'll hear from the acting city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can we stick to the item on the agenda, please?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just wanted to speak to this as considered directing staff to provide a public update on crime within the city that includes trends. But the city is doing. And what additional steps can be taken to reduce or thwart criminal activity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to that part, I think I can add that we could consider adding an oversight committee by the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's clearly different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That mayor, is that in the referral? That's I didn't see that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So as regards the additional steps that we could discuss at council. What is his account.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For us at?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you're saying under.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This under this, we could consider that, I think, in regards to additional steps that we can discuss.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think staff to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To consider that as a possible additional step. But it doesn't have to be at this time because I do have it coming back. It's just another way of that could be considered. That was that was why I think they were looking for discussion now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. So we can have. Yes. And I don't know that we have any speakers on this item.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. A member of addressee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I see no problem with. Having staff. Publicize all the points that are listed in the referral as far as what the current trends are. We have a public information officer. We have we have many ways that the city manager can can make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think that's good direction since it is it is a matter of concern. And across many pockets, many neighborhoods of have expressed this and this is a way to get a update on the city. So I have no problem with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think a workshop is premature. I don't know what tasks that council would be considering or directing without understanding what the trends and and what the actions that staff comes back to us with, with this direction. So I think that's a future item.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then your what you mentioned as another possible step as an oversight committee. Again, I have no idea. What is that, a police review board? Is that a crime committee? I you know that that's something that I'm not prepared to comment on, but that we can, again, looking at what comes back to us and to the public'",
        "'speaker_4': ', more importantly, because the public is is right now is it's spot reporting and we're all hearing it from many different spots. And how does this all come together and what plan does the city have to publicize exactly what you laid out?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm I'm fine with that, but I want to hold off on scheduling any kind of workshop just because I don't want to have a workshop. Just have a workshop. And this like an oversight committee, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What are we overseeing? We don't know yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Any other comments? Vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think one thing that would be helpful and council member matter as briefly touched on this is that we're hearing a number of different reports. And I know that our police officers and police chief have been having various community group meetings and meeting with various constituent groups.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it would be helpful to have that all put together in one report to us so that we can all be on the same page and understand what the concerns have been and and what, you know, what? What our constituents are saying and also how we can go about addressing that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I thought we had a you know, we all attended a meeting at the Edison School at Edison School for one neighborhood. But I think that those types of meetings are happening all over, and it makes sense to have a report on that and hear about that in terms of next steps.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think we probably are going to need a workshop at some point. But I you know, I'm open to holding off. I think we could just say that based off of the report, the council can at that point determine if any next steps are required and what they would be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, everybody.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam Mayor. I mean, on this I was also at that meeting, I think all five of us were at that meeting and and two members of our police force. And, you know what what concerns me is, you know, there seems to be a disconnect.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there were some letters back and forth. And I think the police chief responded to one and I kind of chimed in. But, you know, if you look at the numbers, you know, we are actually in a period of low crime.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yet there seems to be a perception in the community and I don't know, because maybe there are spikes in certain neighborhoods, or maybe because everything that happens that 20 years ago nobody knew about. You know, we're all seeing on Facebook and Twitter, you know, I followed the, you know, the peeps post when we had the incident over'",
        "'speaker_6': 'there with the guy that was chased and he threw his gun away. I mean. I think. You know, that was like real time. So I mean I mean, but, you know, that's the first time I've heard of that happening in Alameda in many years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. I mean, is is there a perception issue or is there a real issue? And if it's a perception issue, you know, then maybe it's not something that, you know, belongs in the police department sphere. I mean, maybe that's, you know, working to communicate that, you know, we are in a period of low crime.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Our officers are doing X, Y and Z, you know, and, you know. So maybe that's why a workshop might be good, you know, a workshop that we can have, you know, statistics talked about and, you know, kind of figure out, you know, where the problem is because people seem to be afraid, but yet the numbers don't back'",
        "'speaker_6': 'up the fear. So, I mean, I think a workshop would be a good idea and I think we should move this forward. And, you know, it'd be interesting to have this discussion because, you know, when these things happen, you know, like it or not, you know, we are the elected officials and the public comes to us and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'expects answers. So and we've done a good job, I think, on, you know, keeping the council informed on hate incidents. You know, I didn't realize there were so many. And it's disappointing that there are, but I'm very appreciative that, you know, we're kept up to speed on those.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think what, you know, everyone has to understand in this building is that we are on the front line. You know, when it comes to people, people see us and they expect us to respond and they expect us to know.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, the more that information we have to share with our constituents, you know, I think the better we can do our jobs and ultimately, the better everyone here can do their jobs.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in regards to the workshop, is that something I've heard?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I supported that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'May I speak to a member? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So I'm wondering if.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We could call Chief.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Larry up. I know he's in the audience. And one of the things that I think I think communication is really important. But there's also a time, a place and a conduit for the information. And I think if the chief doesn't mind me putting him on the spot, as I usually do, but he always handles it really well'",
        "'speaker_5': 'there, you know, we we hear things. And these days with social media, it's it is kind of a double edged sword. Information gets out quickly. It's not always accurate, but it's really hard to get those horses back in the barn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, Chief O'Leary, if you could talk to us a little bit about reporting when an incident comes to light, how and when is it appropriate for the police department or the city or the school district to to comment and maybe also talk to us a little bit about all the different things your officers are doing on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'any given day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Before you answer, I want to ask, is that part of the referral? I don't really believe it is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When we're talking about an update on crime within the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'City that suppose that would be part of the referral that it would happen if we agree, that is the ask, right? So that's actually ahead of where we are. So it's not appropriate at this time. And I apologize, the chief, but that's actually what I'm asking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That would be more comprehensive and not putting you on the spot like it's happening right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, so I put you on the spot, but I'll keep the this the you can sit down, chief. But I do think it's important when we talk about for staff to provide a public update on crime within the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do think it's important to to understand that it's not just necessarily the minute something happens and we we blast an announcement out because an investigation is often under way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's not really the ask right now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't think I said that either.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, I didn't say that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would prefer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm not. All right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so thank you. All right. So I have a referral I did here, so I'd like to make a motion then. So actually I'd like to clarify with that, come back in the form of a workshop with the data at that time, or would we want it to come back at the council as a council meeting and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'then decide in the future of having a workshop? That's fair. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would support having a summary report and overview just like you laid out in the referral. Come back to the council. And it talks about trends. It talks about what's going on and it talks about where the crime is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So with that, then we can have a discussion on whether or not. The next step involves jumping right into a workshop or having a periodic reports so we can start looking at. Point A, point B, trends, what's going on and then make a decision as we see what the data show.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I spend.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, a workshop at least. We've had some workshops that have started prior to council meetings, and I think that this is one of those items. Our, our officers are doing a lot of work, but I also think we need to give a platform so that everybody understands that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's not just that they had one meeting at Edison School that one night, that there's all of the work that's being done. If we're not telling people this is collectively all of the work that we've done, I just think that the report is going to take longer than one item.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And if there's public comment, then I just worry that we're going to cram it into a meeting and then we're not actually going to get to other agenda items. So so that's my only concern and I offer some information.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the police chief has asked his staff to collect data for the last 30 years. It was mentioned at the meeting at the school that all of you went to Edison School.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was meeting.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right, that we would be providing that information. And so the police chief and Arpaio drafted an article that they are planning to give to the public through all of our media outlets, like we do all of the information that we try and get out to the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it shows over the 30 year time period a drop in crime.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That this chamoy area as well as perch crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not currently, but we can bring that data back and give it to the council or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm looking for more specific data.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's right. Right, right. Because I I'm just sort of I want the council to be aware that staff is hearing you not just as this referral, but what was stated and what you have told neighbors that we will provide as much information as we have as we get it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we want staff wants to be able to give that information out to the public. And if we wait to schedule a work shop before we get that information out, it's not in the best interest.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that what they ask, if they're writing an article, obviously you can release your article any time you want data and hopefully share it with council. I mean, that's part of what's happening here is we want to be included.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is the vice mayor and then the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'RASCOFF So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So part of it is also that we're also asking for what additional steps can be taken to reduce or thwart criminal activity. And again, I just think I commend staff for the work that's being done. I really do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that there's been a tremendous effort. I want staff to get credit for the work that's being done because there's a lot of one on one conversations happening. Our officers are responding and even when they're they've been busy with other calls, they're they're going the extra mile and meeting people to take the reports in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I do think we're in a different time. And I also worry about our officers safety when we're seeing these reports real time, when people are listening in on the radio broadcasts. So I also feel like this is an opportunity for us to have a conversation with some of the folks in the public who have a different perception'",
        "'speaker_1': 'of what's going on, and for us to be very united in terms of what's happening so that it's not just our officers, it's the officers, it's the council, it's the city. And we're really trying to look at I think the trends are going to be very helpful for people to see.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That'll change some of the perspective, but I think it will also be good to have that in conjunction to have us collectively have that conversation. The only reason I think a workshop might be helpful is our agendas tend to be so packed that it would it might facilitate a better conversation with the community and kind of support'",
        "'speaker_1': 'what the work that's already being done. So that's kind of where I'm coming from on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mary Ashcroft And actually, I was going to come down on the side of the vice mayor. I think if we could have a workshop, um, timing is always tricky because I actually not that I like giving up my Saturday mornings, but I did think that we were fresh and we were.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But because Friday night really wasn't optimal. And but if we could, because one of the things and I talked to the chief about these things that I think. There's a lot of different perspectives and they're all correct. Statistically, there is a trend.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you look over the last three years, the line is going down. However, if you had your garage broken into or entered in the bicycle stolen or packages taken off your your porch, that's cold comfort. And so that's why we want to make sure that our residents know, to report to the police, not on Facebook and and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to and the police will, you know, they take that information very seriously. And also, these preventive matters now, maybe the 30 years of statistics won't be compiled by then. That's a lot. But I think it might just be a you know, it's structured correctly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It might be an opportunity to hear from neighbors and also to hear from the source rather than the change on social media. That, again, is that double edged sword. It's quick. It gets out there. It's not always accurate and it's really difficult to correct the record.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. But then it's up to staff, of course. When could we I mean, this is we're like looking into the next year, obviously, because.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And it is an impact on our police chief to come out on a Saturday. It's an impact on, you know, staff that's really working hard to try and do actually keep the crime down. And I think what the vice mayor suggested might be a good compromise of doing a workshop at 6:00 or 530 or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm I'm not etched in stone as far as the time in the day, just but a stand alone workshop, I think, you know, is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it isn't as an agenda.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I would also I think we're all respectful of staff time. So we would I'm assuming we would look to the city manager to go back and, you know, with her department, the relevant department heads, most likely the chief, you know, figure out when it works.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We don't want it to be an imposition. And so so I didn't mean that, you know, I'm just saying, if we could figure out there's never one perfect time, I get that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So but if we're already meeting at a council meeting, at least it's easier to schedule the council for that. So it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Helps member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, just quickly, I would agree with what, you know, the vice mayor said, you know, I'm not quite convinced that we are have a crime problem as much as that we are not communicating to the public, you know, the successes of our police department and the good jobs that they're doing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that goes for, you know, a lot of things that staff does. I mean, we talked about the three leases and, you know, the money earlier, you know, that was basically genocide, not in the rest of our staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, you know, if we do some analysis there, you know, let's just make sure we kind of look at more than just, you know, is crime up or is crime down? You know, you know, whether what's up in the front side or, you know, wherever, but, you know, figure out ways that, you know, we can better we'",
        "'speaker_6': 'can better give. Has the vice mayor said give the staff the credit for doing the job that they're doing? And, you know, I'm perfectly fine with having a Saturday meeting. I think I think better at three in the afternoon than three in the morning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I'm worried about two hour, three hour workshops, you know, making council meetings go later. But, you know, it's an imposition on us to to give up our weekends, you know. But that's what we signed up for.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, I mean, however it works out, it works out. But, you know, I'm fine with a weekend workshop to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, so they're in motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll make a motion. So I'd like to move that that we direct staff to compile a report. That would include a public update on crime within the city. That includes trends as well as what the city is doing and what additional steps can be taken to reduce or thwart criminal activity and to hold or conduct a workshop'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to give the report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'd like to second that question. Yes. Member matter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would. But those come simultaneously. I think it's a public report on what's listed on the trends and what you can do. I think police have already are already starting to work on that. I do not want to have that held up and held from the public and waiting for us to schedule a workshop sometime next year'",
        "'speaker_4': '. I think that train can roll by itself and then we get a chance to look at. I prefer that it comes out as soon as it's ready to come out and then we get a chance to look at it, to interact with the community and then have a workshop if we're going to have a workshop.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I want to make sure that distinction is clear.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not saying that we don't I think that part of the conversation has been that the report can be released whenever it's completed, but that the purpose would be to actually host the workshop so that we can discuss the contents of the report in a meaningful way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want to make sure the point is that that report comes out before the workshop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think the report can come out whenever it's ready. Right. I mean, I don't think there's any ask to reject to withhold the information. The reason I submitted the referral is, honestly, I want the information and I would like it as soon as possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I can amend my motion to just state that whenever the report is completed that it be released.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, I would also like to have the workshops set as soon as possible after the information is released so that we can have that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, and again, I think we leave that to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think I think the direction is is that and I think we've made it very clear in the conversation that we scheduled the workshop to occur.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The staff have an estimate of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Time whenever, whenever feasible. I mean, that part of it is also just going to be a schedule, a scheduling issue. And we don't want to schedule the workshop during the holidays when we're not going to be able to actually interact with members of the public.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What I'm hearing is that the report is probably going to be released sometime relatively soon. So through the 30 year timeline of criminal activity by. Part one and part two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'By sector.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five, 30 year timeline by part one and part two citywide from the FBI. Information over a 30 year time period is what we will first give to the public. And as we're doing a more refined data and we can also submit that before workshop.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And what I'm hearing too is that we will try and schedule the workshop as soon as possible, but after the holidays.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And just for clarification, which is kind of what I'm probably being dense here, but what is the part, one part to you?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's major crimes and, you know, rapes and robberies and or even worse.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, is it scheduled at least?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jeff is a better person to me.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Maybe have him speak now. See, that's not too much on the spot. Right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So two things. Part one, crimes are basically the more serious offenses murder, rape, robbery, auto burglary, burglary, grand theft, arson. Things of that nature are two. Crimes are everything else. That's that's how and the reason why it's broken up that way is that's what the how every law enforcement agency reports their crime every month to the FBI'",
        "'speaker_4': '. It's based on something called UCR reporting requirements, uniform crime reporting. So the federal government doesn't care what the individual states thresholds are for, say, grand theft and petty theft. They've got their own categories and they want us to report to them every month based on those categories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So part one is more serious. Part two is everything else.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So my understanding is the city has sectors. That's how we break up the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do. And I have I have crime statistics that are available by those sectors. The article that Sarah Henry and I worked on, that's going to be coming out later this week. I did not break it down by the sectors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just did an overall for the entire island, 30 year kind of a look back. And then I spoke specifically about some of the trends that we're seeing this year. I can absolutely do the sector reports. No problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But one thing that I would want the council to know upfront is that when I was hired 26 years ago, almost, we only had four reporting districts. We now have five. So it's not going to be it's going to be a little bit skewed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And five is the base. It's Alameda Point. In 1992 when I was hired, we didn't patrol that area. We now do. And so that's our fifth sector.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sectors one through four haven't changed or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Changed, or the data would still be relevant in regards to any change in crime in each sector. One through.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Four.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, the addition of five.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rests with with the caveat that sector one has just grown exponentially in the last couple of years with Alameda Landing. So again, you're going to be talking about sector one four that looked one way for 23 years and then for the last couple of years looks entirely different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. And feel free to in your report to make footnotes in regards to that. So the public is aware so that it's more meaningful to the public and to us? Absolutely. That'll be very helpful. Yeah. All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So now can I make one more suggestion? The report can be prepared because I already have the data. It's just compiling it and doing a narrative with footnotes and all that. My suggestion would be that here we are near the middle of November.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If I could come to you in early January, I would have the complete 2017 year. The data from the month of December is usually available in the first week or two of January, and so I could come to you with a complete year that way as opposed to 11 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, so that sounds great. So then we can try to set something in early January. That'd be wonderful. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our second meeting of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That meeting in January, probably. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Welcome. So we have a motion now ready to say something like Vote the motion. And I seconded all those in favor. My motion carries unanimous. Thank you. And now we are on six B was moved.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's going to be coming back to December 5th, six C.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Public hearing to consider amendments to the Community Development BLOCK Grant Action Plans for fiscal year 2010 through 11 through 20 1617. Authorizing the City Manager to execute related documents and adoption of resolution amending fiscal year 20 1718 budget.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. Hi. I'm Lisa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You probably want to pull your mike down just a little. Yeah. Perkins.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Mayor. Members of the city council and staff. I am Lisa Fitts with the Alameda Housing Authority. I'm the manager for the CDBG home and BMR programs and I've been with the city since June.'"
