    "Status Report on Access to the Harbor Bay Ferry Terminal.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'And one of the things we're trying to do is get people out of their single occupancy vehicles. So I'm in this staff report and I understand that that nothing is happening overnight. But the one thing that I didn't see mentioned and I thought that we had discussed is that the AC Transit Liaison Committee meeting, at least one'",
        "'speaker_5': ', if not a couple, is the possibility of exploring a shuttle from the Harbor Bay Ferry to the satellite to a couple of satellite parking lots there. There is one now at the top of Island Drive, just off of Doolittle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then we've talked about possibly doing some satellite parking at the golf course to give people another way to get to the ferry terminal without driving their cars all the way. So is there is there somewhere in this report or in the plan where that can be included?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is Jennifer. Director of base for U.S. Transportation Planning. So we have talked previously about a shuttle and we've looked at the costs of that. I will say that the park and ride is along the route of the line 21.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so if we were to run a shuttle from that, we would be duplicating the transit service. And so that would be something that I think, you know. I think at this point, I will say at this point, we're still hoping that we can work with AC transit to improve the reliability issues that are there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They've already vastly improved their service by meeting all the departures and arrivals. So we haven't started exploring on the shuttle. We've looked at costs and how much that will cost. We don't also have a source of revenue. The wider the revenues from parking charges are one source.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we took control of that. And I and I think we can ask we have folks from Wheaton here is that they're not they are very wary of using revenues to provide a shuttle that would compete with the line 21.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is that correct? Yes, that that they as a public transit agency, would be very wary of using their revenues to compete with another public transit agencies route. So it's something a little bit delicate, I guess. I'm trying to dance a little bit.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It is a little delicate, given that we would be that would be providing a service that would duplicate the line 21.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well. And as we discussed at the AC Transit Liaison meeting, it could even be something that is provided by AC Transit. And I realize that the parking revenues don't bring in a huge amount of money. But one of the reasons that you, among others, that you would charge for parking is as a disincentive to people who could'",
        "'speaker_5': 'actually be walking or don't mind, you know, paying for parking. And then we can help to pay for other means of getting people to the ferries. I just would like us to keep our options as wide open as possible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think what I also what we wrote in the staff report to on and so I take very duly noted. I think we do have some concerns that were raised about and some of our writers have raised concerns about the reliability of the line.'",
        "'speaker_9': '21 It is improved, but could we believe use some additional improvement. And so we did have some of those conversations at the last interagency meeting and we have one coming up in January. And so I think that we are planning to have that be on that agenda of that meeting and to have those conversations about exploring some'",
        "'speaker_9': 'other possibilities. And as we to has more detailed conversations about parking charges, how that money gets spent, what that gets spent on, obviously we to make the ultimate decision. But we would we are a major stakeholder and we could work with them to try to discuss that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I agree we should keep our options open. And I don't think we've heard the last on the transit aspect of this, but it is delicate and a little bit complicated.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Understood. And actually, I think we is a great community partner. I think that we have very similar, if not identical objectives, more riders, more people not driving on the freeways and over the bridge to get to San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I just want to make sure that we're not that we're removing obstacles from our riders so that they can they can get to the ferry and get home from the ferry as easily as possible, which encourages even more ridership.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So yeah, there's a little side. I, we did also have conversations with AC Transit about ways they might be able to shorten their route the line 21 because that is really the problem with the reliability. It's not AC transit, it's a long route.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what you see in the data is that the earlier morning busses are on time. They have no problem. It's when congestion grows in the region. The busses are stuck in traffic just like all the cars. And so it takes them longer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that incremental over time on a long route starts to add up. And so we have asked AC Transit to look at potentially shortening the route. Maybe we could talk with AC Transit about doing a smaller route, like you were saying, just within that area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we have had some of the initial conversations, but there's not yet an easy fix. But I think we should keep talking about it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are no easy fixes. And you made a good point about the incremental time can make and make the difference between missing or catching the ferry. And that is one of the objectives of the proposal. It's not etched in stone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There will be community meetings but about adding that bus transit lane on island drive to just speed the the 21 line up so we can get back to the ferry more quickly. Okay. We've probably taken enough time and we thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Very, very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's other counts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, that's great. Yeah, sure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, I'm a member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks. I was going to pull this just to ask you a few quick questions. Thank you for the update. I think I know the answer, but I'll just ask you anyway. So I think we did a referral maybe a month or two ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is not in response, that this is an event preparation for that. Is that kind of correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In addition to this referral?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So this is the only thing we're going to get, are we? Because I thought we were going to have a workshop maybe after the first of the year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Well, no, this is this is all the data we have assembled, all the data and put this in this report as a status report on everything that's going on at the Harbor Bay. And we've met several times with the ferry riders that have expressed a lot of concern.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're working with them closely on trying to add parking supply and working with them on a number of issues. And so this is the culmination of a lot of meetings and work to date. So that was the intent of the stock.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, then I'll kind of add my $0.02 on these numbers. I mean, do we know I think this is exhibit six, which is the actual on time stats. So on the like a third that arrive early, which I mean, it sounds like it's a good thing people get there in time to take the boats.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But do we know that? Do we know that the busses are leaving early from other points or other stops? Because if you miss, if the bus leaves early and you're not there, you miss your spot. You miss your bus, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. Do we know that that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Would be the concern and what that's what we hear anecdotally. We have AC transit here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you have the data often?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This is awesome Lee with the AC transit but we did that is the concern with the early is that you get to those bus stops early and that people are waiting and thinking the bus is still coming. It's already late so.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well so our if you combine our on time versus early in the morning, it's 90% cumulative. And the previous time point going to the ferry in the morning, we're actually pretty late. It's about in the sixties, but we added so much time between the last time point on Bay Farm and the other time point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The last time point on the East End that by the time it gets to the Harbor Bay Ferry terminal, it'll be on time or early. So depending on where you bought it from, if it's the East End, the bus could be, you know, 10 minutes late.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But by the time you get into Harbor Bay, according to our schedules, it'll be there on time before the ferry departs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I'm a little concerned about that, that people are not being able to catch the bus on time. And then I know some people hate this statement. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But in this case, I think, you know, we have to be as perfect as we can because you miss one day'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and there's 20 people that now are going to be late for work. And, you know, that could mess up a person's entire day. And, you know, we've had five days and it looks from this number, we've had five, five busses arrive late.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, I mean, that's a lot of people that kind of have sort of the lead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of the late direction. It's the same thing for the PM.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I mean, the I'm sorry to interrupt, but you know, the evening numbers, some of them are even more like one of them. 40% depart late, but I'm more worried about the morning. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. So there's that there's going to be a 10% chance where it would be late in the morning and that's the difference. But we have so we have only three trips in the morning, so 10% seems high. But if to get to that 10%, basically since we only run like three trips in the morning every day, you'",
        "'speaker_8': 'basically. Be about one late trip out of the entire.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Week for.'",
        "'speaker_8': '4 to 5 days. So it's it's not to say they're not showing up, but our average is also 2 minutes late. And so it's really hard for us to get all the trips there, but we do try our best.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've added the time. So I think one of the major concerns for us also is that we have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To be kind of aware of our other customers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we don't want to add too much time because then that convenience inconveniences the other passengers that are, you know, further upstream. But definitely for the trips that go directly into Harbor Bay, we've added that time to make sure that people are getting there no later than the ferry departure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Not to like overstate the obvious, but, you know, we are kind of building our entire transit scheme and solution around ferry. So just to let you know, it's critical at least for me and I'm sure it's for my colleagues, I don't want to speak for them that, you know, this timing and everything is in sync because'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this is what we're telling people. And you need to start taking the bus to the ferry. You take the bus to the ferry. So if it's not working, then our solution is problematic for people. So just keep that in mind and thanks for putting this together.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I hope we can see this data, you know, on like a regular recurring basis. So thanks, Misan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Member matter. SC Then Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just, just a comment that I'd like for the next one, if we could get the ridership stats for the line 21 two AD and start tracking those trends.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes, we can absolutely do that. Thank you. And I will just want to add some good news is that we didn't have all the October data about for ferries, but by the time that this came out and the actual October data was 15% above where it was the year before in October.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So really ferry ridership is going up. So that's the good news, you know, and we're not having impacts in the neighborhood, but we do know that there are ferry riders that are being impacted, especially for that, those later ferries.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we are trying to see what we can do to help them and to solve this bus issue, which I agree is not 100% solved yet. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We'll add the bus.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Absolutely out of the bus data. We can come back when we have Mayor May. What we'll do is we'll come back when we have a I think next year. At some point we've got a lot more data and maybe we have some better solutions or we've had more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'll see meetings where we can start to hash out really what are what are we going to go on with the line of the bus service?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the vice mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just, you know, had a similar question, which was along the line of councilmember moderates, which is the ridership numbers to the ferry terminal, since that is the focus here in terms of trying to mitigate that and getting a kind of wrapping our heads around what that data looks like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I also want to echo the concern that we look at the golf courses, additional overflow parking with some sort of connector. But there's the other concern, which is the ridership that comes from the East End. You know, what can we do to get them out of their cars?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because if they're still crossing the bridge, the congestion, as we know, is on Island Drive and and the the bridge is impacted. Obviously.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Those we can absolutely look at those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I wanted to give you an opportunity since this is an update on this, if there's any higher level information that you want to share with the public, for instance, when do you think the charging of the parking lot will come into effect or any other issue that you think we should share with the public?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. I think that's a great suggestion. So we will. So as you saw, this is a status report where we've made a lot of progress implementing aspects, but there are still aspects to implement. And one of them is we are looking more specifically, they've adopted a parking policy for their tier system, but they need to now start'",
        "'speaker_9': 'looking at the particular ferry terminals in Harbor Bay will be the first one that they will look at. What they've said is in early to 2018, the things just so you know, we're having conversations with the ferry riders and with know that is they will grapple with a little bit is you don't want to because there's already'",
        "'speaker_9': 'the impact on the neighborhood permit parking by adding parking charges, in some ways you're creating another disincentive for parking. On the other hand, you actually hear from ferry riders that if there were more parking and there were kind of other alternative solutions, they were kind of open to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Because the permit parking might allow there to be a more equitable distribution of the permits for folks that take the later ferry. So you might have a better chance of getting a permit for the 830 ferry. If you're if you're a mom in the East End who's, you know, or dad rushing to drop your kid off.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so you might have a better chance of getting that 830 ferry if the permits are are distributed more equitably or distributed. So there is I don't want to speak for Christine, but there is some lukewarm support for parking charges as long as we're also kind of trying to solve some of these supply issues by adding the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'parking at Harbor Bay, looking at looking at the reliability of line 21 so that they have those options. I think there is an openness to doing that, obviously within reason. But we'll be working with them and we to on the implementation of parking charges and making sure that we're supporting them with outreach on those and, you know'",
        "'speaker_9': ', and adding our $0.02 to that process from our community standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you also share in regards to there are some cars that park overnight and especially the lot on it's Harbor Bay or Bay Farm. Are we doing anything to not allow that because then the spaces are already taken.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So you mean in the actual read a lot?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, currently right now at the parking lot, the ferry. There are people that will work overnight.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Do not know a Kevin Connolly with the water merchant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know so they use if not for ferry parking but for other uses maybe to go catch a plane.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Kevin Connolly with the Water Television Authority. We have a an arrangement with the security force for Harbor Bay Business Park, and they regularly patrol the lot.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if there is a car parked overnight, they have directions to citation in tow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's not that it doesn't happen. But there we do have.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'An enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's regular and does kind of guard against it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you. And then I do want to agree also with my council members in regards to the concern and this isn't for Rita. This is actually I thought the bus cannot be late. And and actually the 10% is too much because people cannot go to work.'",
        "'speaker_2': '10% of the time. They will not have a job. Unfortunately, if that happens once, they will not take the bus again unless they really have no other choice. So from my perspective, I if AC Transit is not able to do that, I that that to me goes to why it is important for Alameda as a city to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'be looking at a private shuttle. And the idea of having allowing parking at the golf course, for instance, and then having some shuttle that connects people to the ferry. I think we do have to look at alternatives. If if in fact, 10%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in fact, the example of one day a week is 20%. If that if that's the case. Right. So. So I just want to share that I, I that's my position. 10% late does not work.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And if you might, I just add, is that especially when it's very difficult, when you have ferries running every 60 minutes. And one of the benefits, you have a ferry, let's say we're running or 15 minutes being late.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You wait 10 minutes, you get ferry, right? Yes. But one of the issues I just want to kind of it's a you're right. That's why you wait an hour and that's unacceptable. Or we do talk about the Stafford with the option of taking the bus, getting on the Transbay bus.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what we've heard from some of ferry riders is that takes a lot longer to get to work and so than the hourly. So I agree with you and I think we agree that it's a real challenge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to send a very clear message to AC transit. My position is 10% late is not sufficient. That cannot happen and it cannot happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think it's good direction that we will take back to the next ILC meeting that we have in January to the AC Transit Board members on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just for clarification, I am interested in possibly a shuttle from a satellite parking. I was not advocating for a private shuttle. One of the things we heard at the last is transit liaison meeting, is that you do need to be concerned with the quality of your drivers and all that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think it is something that we can work out among the different agencies also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But my point was, if AC transit can only deliver 10% of the time on time. No.'",
        "'speaker_9': '90% on time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, sorry, 90% on time. Would be horrible. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Member Oti.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam Chair. I move that we receive the status report on the implementation of the approved plan for access to the Nairobi ferry terminal.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Second, all those in favor. I thank you. Five D.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Recommendation received the information technology.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this was an item that had been on. Oh, and we had. Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. We had a speaker on five c, Christine Locke, if you want to come on up. I'm so sorry. You can.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Authorize yours.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I probably covered everything I wanted to say, but I just wanted to come up and really say thank you to the city council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Christine Lock. I'm an Alameda resident and a ferry rider from the Harbor Bay Terminal. I really just wanted to come up here today to say thank you to the city council and staff for really engaging on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It really means a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lot to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Us and it affects a lot of people. I think the short term plans that were in the plan are great steps in the right direction, but I just wanted a plea for thinking bigger and further into the future like I think was just discussed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I know that the the terminal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is really popular.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've just added a new boat and I know that we TA has confirmed that the service will be an every 30 minutes service at some point in the future, and I think it's great, but that's a lot of people, that's a lot more people that will be heading to that terminal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I don't.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Think that the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Kind of baby incremental steps are going to be enough. There aren't enough now, are there aren't meeting the challenges now, and they certainly won't meet the challenge as this terminal continues to grow. You know, without a major, major parking expansion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The next alternative is really AC transit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as you've discussed already.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There are major problems like on the ground from the ferry riders perspective. It just isn't an option. I know that it's, you know, on the fliers and it's on the forefront of past ways being, you know, pushed on us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But it really isn't an option right now because of reliability issues. It isn't serving everybody in the in the areas that take the ferry. There's one bus per boat. And as already talked to her, it's not even if it's not on time a little bit, that's not enough.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like we can't show up to work every other day late. So that's why no one really right now is engaging with it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So my plea really is just.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To think big.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to think further into the.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Future.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right now, what's happening and what will happen in the future is that people will arrive, try to park, fail, drive to Main Street, drive to BART and cross the estuary, drive across the bridge to work and park in San Francisco.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or they will drive home, try to catch no x bus and then do that all over versus coming back or they'll get rides. We're not taking cars off the road.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I think you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Already on my side. Most of it. I thank you for your time. I think everybody's work on this issue. It means a lot. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. Five D. So this item had been on the regular agenda item last time. It's on content, but I wanted to give you an opportunity. This is the recommendation to receive the information technology strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So I wanted to give you an opportunity to share briefly what the plan is. And then I wanted to see where. Free Wi-Fi in the city or in the business districts in their.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Mayor. Council members. I'm Carolyn Hogg, the information technology director, and Terry Shackleton from next level. He's the founder of Next Level is the consultant that we contracted with to help us draft a 3 to 5 year drought plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we just have a brief high level presentation for you tonight. We felt it was time that the city actually engage in this in a formal strategic plan for technology, because the last time one was performed was back in 2000, 17 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in 17 years, technology has dramatically changed as well as business applications. We found that our core systems haven't been upgraded or replaced in years, and we have some aging infrastructure and our city departments really approach technology independently.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that really created a siloed approach to technology, which meant that we were following very few standards and policies, and the standards that we were following were very outdated. So it was time to move in the 21st century.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we contracted with next level and they did an actual a comprehensive review of all of our current infrastructure, our inventory of hardware and software, our processes, our technology, documentation and policies. And they also interviewed every city department and created a voice of the user survey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so they took all of that data that they gathered and created basically compared to other cities and best practices in network security, budget staffing, equipment, replacement cycles, I.T. governance and much more. And so Harry is going to come up and over the next couple of slides now and give the overview of the report.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello. My name is Terry Herkelman, senior vice president at next level. Appreciate your time today. I'll go through these pretty quickly. They're busy slides. They came out of the IT strategic plan where we talk a little more detail.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the first slide I wanted to talk about is just the realization that municipalities are complex organizations, therefore their technology is complex. And as you can see from the graphic here, when you really plot all of the technology being used today in the city, it's a complex scenario.'"

    "Information Technology Strategic Plan Presentation. [Postponed from November 7, 2017]": [
        "'speaker_8': 'As we look at the planning side of this, it's important to look at all components at the very bottom level, how you manage your technology, the infrastructure, which is all the network, the desktop, everything that delivers that technology you have to look at as well as you have enterprise applications that are really strategic because those are applications'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that everybody, all the departments should be able to leverage. And then you have, of course, a bunch of department applications. So as we went through this process, we kind of looked for weaknesses throughout this because a weakness in any one component of that can dramatically affect all users.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it was important to have that kind of holistic view when we did the planning exercise. I think it's important to note that the complexity that you have here at the city is pretty consistent. We've we've now done 75 California cities, many of them of similar sized years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're not unique in that way. In fact, as you advance with more technology, the complexity is likely to even get a little a little more intense. So I think at this point, I think your your environment is pretty consistent.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Perfect. One of the keys to doing it, strategic plan is really getting alignment because at any point in time, trying to keep up with technology is very, very difficult. It's expensive. And so what we want to do with the strategic plan is understand where you're at today, have a realistic and objective understanding of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We also want to understand what the demands are. What do the departments need in order to improve service, streamline their business processes? And then what we want to do is try to figure out the alignment of that. The idea that you'd have the budget and technology resources to achieve perfect alignment over the planning period is probably a'",
        "'speaker_8': 'little unrealistic, but you have to kind of go through that process to understand what that gap is, and that's what this slide really goes to. The other really important part about this slide is the strategic plan is more than just about hardware and software.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's about people and it's about processes. Sometimes you have technology that's just underutilized. That's not leverage. We wanted to factor that into the plan so you don't just start throwing out technology when it's more of a process. People issue and maybe training and other other strategies might employ that technology more effectively for you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So again, we kind of looked at all those components. Technology guy can't figure out how to work the remote. Look at that. This next slide, we kind of refer to this as our Spider Graham and Carolyn. Talk about this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's a lot of work that went behind how we plotted. What you see here is the six dimensions that we looked at which really aligned two best practices for I.T. management and service delivery, specifically oriented towards public agencies.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We went through all of those dimensions, and then what we did is went through a series of analysis. And then we came to what we thought was kind of an appropriate rating for that. What you see on this diagram is if you're on the outside of this, you're largely a reactive organization.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What that means is you're you know, you're pretty much taken issues, fixing issues, taking issues, fixing issues. You probably aren't doing enough planning. You're probably not thinking enough about, you know, disaster recovery, business continuity, because you don't have time to do that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're just trying to keep the wheels on the car, so to speak. The orange is the proactive. What that means is that you've got some best practices in place. You are starting to plan, you're starting to manage that delivery or you're managing your service levels with the departments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then what we've got is, as you move in towards the center, is the really high value. What's important about this chart is not all public agencies necessarily want to drive to that green because there's a cost to doing that as you implement technology and the practices around it can get very expensive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So what was important is kind of figuring out where is the right place for the city of Alameda? Where does the value and benefit really make sense? As you can see from this chart, the cities largely kind of in a reactive, proactive, and there's already been some steps to take care of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's some governance activities to help with the alignment in the service delivery. You're already taking steps on your helpdesk, so you're already starting to implement some of that. One of the items up on the infrastructure side, which is one of the dimensions that we really heard a lot about and it's mentioned in our plan and we have'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a lot of discussion about was the fact that you really run all of the city on a single network. You've got an electric utility. The security requirements around the electric utility is significantly more than what a typical admin network would be.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so what happens is that that impacts your your city, the rest of the city department users, because they have a higher security standard than what their peers might at another city. So we've made some recommendations for try to alleviate some of those pain points and improve the ability for staff to be able to access the network'",
        "'speaker_8': 'remotely wireless. And those type of initiatives that under a single network running all of your utilities is problematic. I won't go through all the SWOT analysis here. A couple of highlights I want to talk about. One is the staff is really committed to figuring out how to use technology.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, that's that's not a given. Everywhere we go, sometimes people are kind of against technology and like the way the old way things are done. We didn't hear that people are really excited about trying to figure out how to leverage technology.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It generates a lot of opportunities that we identified in this from a weakness, a standpoint is, you know, you've got an I.T. organization that's really kind of trying to turn and reinvent itself to start following best practice and get the tools in place, get the technology in place that they can actually meet the service requirements that the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'departments are asking for out of them. And then also on the on the threat side is really one of the things. There's two things we look at. One is just the physical security, and that's something that we've made some recommendations on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The other is security in general. You know, you don't have to pick up a paper or turn on the news to understand the the threat of hackers and vulnerabilities that you have with your network and your network security.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's something you just have to continually evolve on. And so while I think you're in a pretty good security position today, you can't really lie down on that. You've got to keep keep actually being very vigilant about that and continue to evolve your processes to keep up with the threats that are going to come to the city'",
        "'speaker_8': 'from outside.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So the next slides actually are readable. So the city got together and we really talk about, okay, where do we want to be as a city we're in, as an organization, and what are our options? So the first columns are actually all the in-process projects that are underway right now, and then the rest of it is our'",
        "'speaker_0': '3 to 5 year roadmap. And many of the projects that are up there are multiyear projects. So for instance, the H.R. Payroll financial system replacement is a two to 2 to 3 year implementation timeframe. So I'm not going to go through all of the in-process projects right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But as you know, fire has implemented voce, which is our EOC system that once we activate the EOC, this is a system that will be using and they continue to tweak it. We've have the city website vendor has been chosen and a new city website is planned on being in production either spring or some summer of 2018'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And this will help the public actually get, you know, better information. And it also let the city push information in more timely. Some of the other in process, Terry, mentioned Wi-Fi and VPN access. That is in process right now.'",

So we're planning on implementing Wi-Fi throughout city buildings. And then Rick and Park. I wanted to note that they actually went live this Monday with their new system active net, and that helps them'",
        "'speaker_0': 'with their, you know, program registrations and everything. So that was a good implementation recently. So as I mentioned on that exercise, where all the city departments got together, we we realized that the biggest benefit that most city departments will realize is replacing the h.r.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Payroll financial system. So in 2018, $200,000 has been allocated to actually hire a consultant and we consulted with next level to do an H.R. finance needs assessment and meet with all the city departments and see what we want in an ERP system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that work is being taken on right now, and they're actually going to help us draft our RFP and do vendor negotiations in 2018. We requested 1.5 million to be allocated to the actual replacement of the H.R. financial system.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was actually a unanimous vote from all city departments. That was the voice of the user that that was the biggest benefit that we all felt would be realized by the city is replacing that system. And then another 1.5 million has been allocated in 2018 and 2019 for these different projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In order to be able to create an administrative network. We need to do a fiber infrastructure review and see where the conduit is throughout the city that we might be able to pull new fiber to create that administrative network, which will then allow us to go into a smart city initiatives and possibly offer public Wi-Fi traffic management'",
        "'speaker_0': ', those types of smart city initiatives, the electronic content management solution. As I mentioned, each department approached technology independently. So we have multiple implementations of laser fish, which is our document management system, but they were all implemented in different ways.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so that the funding is going to go into a like a comprehensive document imaging type solution. And then out of the citywide department meetings, there were three projects that are they don't have any funding allocated to it yet.'",

And then the centralized address repository came up. Right now we have multiple address repositories. The cost to that is either, you know, from nothing to 25,000, so that we can consolidate all the different addresses that we'",

And then Fire is requesting to replace the records management system because it's not meeting their needs, and that's estimated at 25 to 30000. As Terry mentioned, this is a visual of it specific operational projects that my department is going to be performing over the next 3 to 5 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And as Terry mentioned, we've already started. We're establishing a service management system. So basically a helpdesk tracking management so we can track trouble calls and do some trending and be more proactive and better serve our customers. And then also on there, along with some other valuable operational type changes, is we're really focusing on our, you know, developing'",

Is I did bring a referral supporting public wi fi wasn't here to actually vote on it's my understanding that council did support it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So maybe you could expand how. But but part of the process it will be.'",

Can we run it on the city's fiber network? If we establish it, we could, you know, target even key areas like down Clark Street and Webster Street.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. Shelby. And she someone to chime to her. So she gets up to 6 minutes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, hi. So some of what Chris said, I'll be saying as well, and expanding on a little bit and making some recommendation. And I think Julie saw me at the last meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if you can speak clearly into the memory.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Okay. So just let me start. Thank you for this opportunity to speak and for taking the time to consider our concerns about the Smart Reading Program in Alameda. My name is Shelby Sheehan. I am an all nighter resident.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My background is in public health. I have a master's science from UCLA in Environmental Health, and I'm a doctoral candidate in environmental science and engineering. I'm here to express my concerns about the health risks associated with electromagnetic radiation from smart meters and the compulsory smart meter installation program currently underway in Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I previously submitted a letter to all of you about this issue. In it, I include references and additional links to support the statements I'm making before you tonight. I would like to use this time to summarize that information and reiterate my recommendations for the Council to give to AMP regarding the Smart Meter program.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please feel free to use my letter as a starting point and I respectfully request that you continue to do further reading to educate yourself more fully about smart meters and M-F radiation health concerns. My first recommendation is for a complete moratorium on meter installations.'",
        "'speaker_4': '5757 other counties or cities in California have already done this. For example, Marin County, the cities of Piedmont Local, Richmond local as well, Santa Phil and Sebastopol, among others. These moratoriums were adopted to protect health, safety and welfare of the residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alameda should follow suit. Make no mistake, this is a huge health and safety issue. Smart meters constantly emit EMF radiation that interferes with a biological functions and makes people sick. As Chris said, for example, it can cause significant acute problems such as debilitating fatigue and severe neurological issues, worsening of mental health disorders, neuropathy, and tonight, among others'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Just as important, MF radiation can cause cancer. This fact is recognized by many prestigious and well-known organizations, including who that Chris mentioned and a multitude of scientific and academic organizations. All recognize the acute health effects and cancer risk from units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most vulnerable are those that already have health problems or other sensitive populations. Included on that list are people with multiple sclerosis, autism, children, and those with cancer, just to name a few. Sensitive populations. So what is the risk associated with iems from smart meters?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It is common knowledge that cell phone use, among other things, should be limited to do it due to an increased risk of cancer from EMF radiation. For example, the manufacturers say that the radiation from a smart meter is minimal, equivalent to that of a cell phone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But in real life, there's overwhelming evidence of a much greater risk. In fact, Dr. Dietrich Heart, who is an M.D. and a Ph.D. and an expert in MF Radiation, calls MF Illness the health crisis of our time. Many experts in report after report and study after study, including those published in peer reviewed journals, which is the highest'",
        "'speaker_4': 'scientific standard there is as well. Laypeople who videotaped the levels of radiation from smart meters in actual use demonstrate that the risk is much higher than industry states. Based on real life data. The actual risk of cancer from smart meters is 100 times that of a single cell phone.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is two orders of magnitude. It's clearly a significant risk, especially for sensitive populations and should be alarming to us all. Therefore, a moratorium on smart meter installations is warranted unless and until the known health risks are addressed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My second recommendation. With or without a moratorium is about the opt out. As Chris said presently, you can opt out of getting a meter, but it costs $125 initially and then $10 a month after that, which is prohibitive to a lot of families and discriminatory and illegal in my opinion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Furthermore, the ability to opt out sunsets after two years, which means after after two years, you can't opt out anymore. They take that right away from you and they are going to force a smart meter on you. But.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's absolutely unacceptable given the known health risk concerns. Therefore, my second one, my second recommendation is to eliminate the opt out charge as well as a sunset clause. My third recommendation is about the issues in multifamily units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, I'm I'm marrying what Chris said in multifamily units. One could have five, ten, 20 or more smart meters, all constantly emitting huge amounts of EMF radiation, causing an incredible increased health risk associated with so many in one place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Many are place right outside bedrooms, a role. Children are sleeping. No one should be forced to have their children exposed to such high amounts of radiation. Therefore, because of the aforementioned known health concerns, I recommend a rule that if one resident of a multifamily unit wants to opt out, then the entire building must be exempted from all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'smart meter installations. In conclusion, I urge the City Council to put the health and safety of Alameda residents as the top priority by directing AMP to one halt further installations of smart meters until safety can be established to eliminate the opt out cost and the sunset clause.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And three discontinue installations on multifamily units if even one resident opposes them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. This is the Potter. And then Gabby Dolphin, another Curtis.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am. They've said a lot of the points that I wanted to make, so I'll just go on with my personal points. I've been a resident in Alameda since 2002. I was really surprised to find out that there was no way that I was going to have to pay to opt out of something that clearly has health'",
        "'speaker_0': 'hazards and is. Is it trespassing technology? It really. I just felt bullied into having to pay. I can't afford this opt out fee and I shouldn't have to afford this opt out fee. As a single mom, it's just ridiculous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's appalling. So as well. Personally, I am immunocompromised. My son. I don't want him playing by that. Technology. It's right in the children's area. My husband has passed away from cancer. This is something that clearly has health hazards and should not be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It should be with caution that we. We. Take this technology and it seems like it's being forced upon us. And I. I just really resent that. And I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Love Alameda. I love.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Living here. And I've even considered moving away. And I don't want to do that. I really enjoy this community that we have. I believe that there should not be an opt out fee, that this is extortion and it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've already sent notices of liability to Nicholas. Michael Picker and Barbara Lee and Senator Feinstein. And I am going to go forward with this. If I continue to feel like I'm being bullied into something that clearly is hazardous and is illegal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I would hope that you could put a moratorium on this. I would appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Gabby Dolphin.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Gabby Donovan once again, High City Council, August body and mayor. What's being said here is really pertinent at this time. I don't have a specific statement about smart metering. I want to say, though, that I have been working with AMP and Pub for a while, a few months and the pub board and AMP have they've really looked'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to change, to open up, to be more available to the community. And for that I'm really, really grateful and I really think Nico's over there because he's new here and he's stepped into not a minefield, but good lord, we're a new community to him and times are changing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've got a lot of serious issues. But my concern again has to do with the structure of communication in the governance of this municipality. And if I were to take a huge step back and look at the large picture, we have the pub board, big business, and sitting on the pub board is our city manager and I'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'only using concepts, not names. This is not about UGL, it's about roles. City managers. We've got big business in bed with our government. And and the reason I bring that up is that I feel there's a real difficulty penetrating through pub and amp in so difficult.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't even know what questions to ask. So what I did was I submitted a four year request to AMP and they very graciously gave the information I requested. But the idea being that it should have been available to me and it should be communicable and not communicable, that's a disease.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to communicate about it, but to know beforehand what's going on with AMP, I honestly don't feel that these people are coming to you for help. But what I understand when I read the city charter and I did when I first started talking to Frank about looking at the climate change thing again, I interpreted it to be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mean. See that the city council had far more weight and influence because you are our elected officials and you carry our word to staff and to pub and that's not happening. What happens is they listen, listen, listen, listen.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nice, good idea. And boom, we go straight forward with street smart meters or. I can understand the joy, but I don't see any joy in the fact that AMP is going to be a huge new revenue stream with this new killer technology business that's going in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I do believe I saw a little bit of glee that, you know, there's going to be a big revenue stream open up because they're going to be taking electricity. What about solar? What about wind? What about geothermal?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I didn't hear any talk about that alternate energy. We have a huge business coming in that's going to suck up energy was the word used. So my concern is. I know we're constrained by our charter, but surely we can give more thought to it on how we communicate and how we open up about this issue, in particular'",
        "'speaker_3': 'energy, the changing energy landscape, the desires, desires of the people of Alameda. And having pub and amp work with us. Not well, you know. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Heather Curtis and then Nancy Gordon. And if you want to speak on some time, please submit your slip. Morning. And there, Curtis, that quite morning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been a native here for 50 years, and I cannot be as articulate as these wonderful people have. But I have grave concerns, not only about well, mostly about the health effects, whipped, sorry, surveillance and the gathering and selling of my personal data.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've heard some people say now that big data is the new big oil. Chairman former Chairman Wheeler, there's a video going around saying, you know, we're going to roll out the 5G. It's going to make us billions. We don't care who regulates it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No scientific studies being done. So we've got huge issues with this. Hacking vulnerabilities, fires, especially increasing during power surges, inaccurate billing issues, and again, the 29 sun set for the opt out. I can also not afford the opt out fee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I paid over $500 for three years to puny to keep a smart meter off of my home. At which point, after three years, emails were released between the PGA executives and the PUC, showing that they were very much aware of the liability and health problems with smart meters and they had to quit charging us for them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's all available on stop smart meters dot org. So I should not be forced to put a dangerous device in my home. Not on it, because this technology and frequencies are coming into my home or have to pay an opt out fee to prevent one from being installed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We also do not want I do not want any, am I? Meters. Which is what they're substituting advanced meters in some cities and regions saying that they're are not smart meters, but they really are as dangerous. And just a little bit about me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have an older flip phone, which I only use for emergencies. No cell phone, my cable and for my computers and my phone is hard wired. I haven't ever had wi fi in my home and I even got rid of my microwave once I started doing my own research in due diligence on how dangerous these technologies are'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So and I think at this point, I hope if 5G is rolling out, this will become an agenda item because that's much worse than what we've got now. So I respectfully request that you, as my representatives require amp.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'AMP you be to do your due diligence by reviewing all of the independent studies that are out there. We can't rely on industry. They're covering all of this up and they're very much aware of the health dangers of this wi fi, smart meters, all of them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Nancy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I hope you do the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And she's our last speaker on this item.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, mayor and council members. Yeah. I would also like you and I corroborate what they say. I agree. And I'm a Spanish major, so I don't know all that scientific stuff. However, about eight years ago, when my two oldest granddaughters were little, they're ten and eight now.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I attended I happened to get a call from a former flight attendant friend of mine and she said, you've got to go to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco and listen to these experts about EMF and damage. So I went and after that I signed up for the Commonwealth Club and I had a lot of information.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'These are people from not only the United States but in Europe and I believe it. I gave the notes to my son and his wife, but I believe that in France they were forbidding cell phones for kids under 12.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean, there are developing brains and things like that. I probably already have fried my brain with cell phones and wireless and everything like that. And sometimes I can feel I used to be able to feel pains going through my head if I had my phone and that was even with a landline starting.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But some of us have businesses where we can't really avoid all that. It's supposed to make it easier. But there was a lot of information. And now it's coming out on the Web sites that people have mentioned and that they've given you and their letters.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm unsure of how it invades privacy. Again, that's not my field of expertize at all, but I trust the people who've done the research. I also watched a very informative video of a retired and highly experienced and respected fire chief about the Northern California fires and references to smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's is pretty bizarre and kind of scary. Very scary. And now we've got new fires. I'm just wondering if there's a relationship between the drones and. Smart meters. Who knows? I did hear about from my body worker who on Grand Street.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She's a doctor. She gave me the Web site for special plugs that I can plug in. Is supposed to kind of neutralize EMFs in my house. I mean, I can't test it myself, but I'm starting to plug in me, and I give it to my son in his family.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let's see this supposed to filter out some of that. I mean. I'm probably older than. About everybody in this room. And when I was a kid, my parents kept saying, Nancy, don't sit so close to the TV. And then I used to stare at the microwave.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I like to watch stuff happening until I heard, Oh, that's not so cool to do. So some things we learn. By accident. Other things we learn by like don't put Tupperware, don't heat your stuff in Tupperware in the microwave.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I mean. So far I'm still alive, so kick in and try to kick the smart meters off my property. I happened to go out my front door and here was a guy from AMP. And anyway, I don't want to get the opt out fee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A lot of assumptions are being made and. Their health hazards up the ying yang. I don't want our young people to. Have the repercussions of all this going on. And I think it is big business and reminds me of the competition with Comcast days.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. She was our last speaker. So there's a referral. Um, did any council members want to make comments or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yes, Niko Pro is here too, if you want to ask questions or he can maybe answer some of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Did you want to share any information?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening again, Madam Mayor. Council members. A couple of things I wanted to just touch upon specifically related to the sunset provision, which are current rules and regulations specify that everyone has to have a smart meter starting in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have an item going to the board for our Monday meeting to lift that provision. It's actually been something we've been talking about for a couple of months. We're going to bring it to the board around January, February, in light of the concerns have been expressed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We brought it forward. We're also going to be including a low income provision in there as well. I will say that speaking to this and some of the other provisions about the charges as a municipal utility, we are subject to different rules and laws than P.G. and he is we have to provide the service at cost.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So even though there's a perception that the cost might be significant, we are really constrained in terms of our flexibility to make adjustments to those charges. Regarding the city charter provisions, I would turn to the attorneys to address that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I will say that, you know, there is this process to to approve the smart meter program was a long process starting way back in 2012. It really picked up steam around 2014, 2015, 2016 with multiple items going towards the PUC discussions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not specifically focused on this issue, but it did come up. We did do our due diligence. We go out and we talk to other utilities. We're not the first one doing this. There's currently about 90 million meters out there right now and growing, probably covering about 70% of the utilities out there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Everybody in Alameda has a smart gas meter currently. So we're we're not really at the leading edge of this. But, you know, we do recognize some of the concerns are Web page has included information on this. We did update some of the information with much more detailed analysis that some of the speakers did touch upon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But as far as the emissions associated with the meters, these meters meet all standards and we go by the standards. If there are some changes based on new scientific developments. We do monitor those and we will make adjustments accordingly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're very proactive about that. But so far, the regulatory agencies, the FCC, there have been no no new standards that have been promulgated. And as far as the testing goes, our meters remain well below the regulatory standards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have a question. We heard about a more moratorium in other cities. Are you familiar with other cities adopting a moratorium on these?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not very familiar with with other cities adopting moratoriums.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And you did say that there's going to be apparently some low income discount or something. Could you say specifically what that is?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our current low income discount is about 25%. Exactly 25%. We went to the Peavey. A couple of months ago to change the eligibility requirements because we felt that the income levels weren't keeping up with the pace of of how expensive it is in the Bay Area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that captured more customers. And certainly anybody who meets those eligibility requirements will also be able to take advantage of that discount as it applies to the opt out fee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So is that already occurring? So people can go on the website and get the information about the income levels? Are is that already there?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The income levels are available. The item is going to the pub on Mondays.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this part is also going to the p this part. Okay. I don't understand that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. A member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just a science question, because I wasn't a Spanish major, but I was not into science. So we did this referral on like city Wi-Fi. And then the one woman's comment about how everything she has is hard wired and no Wi-Fi and so on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I don't know what what is the difference in like I guess what is the word a mission if we had a city Wi-Fi versus what what these smart meters are emitting? I mean, is it the same?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is it more? Is it less? I mean, maybe if you don't know, you don't know. And that's perfectly understandable. But just curious.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, we I can't speak to that. I don't know what the what the emissions levels would be for a city wi fi. I mean, we do know that based on the testing that's been done, you know, these are far more of an issue than our smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there's other things out there as well. I mean, there's cell towers, there's microwaves, there's a lot of different contributing factors. So when we go out and we do our testing or analysis, we try to do it in as clean environment as possible in light of the fact that everybody has wireless routers in their houses, they have'",
        "'speaker_7': 'cellphones, they have the microwaves. There's it's really ubiquitous. So it's very difficult to kind of and I think in that particular issue, you'll run into the same situation because there will be interference from many different sources as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it'll be hard to tell exactly what that number would be for a a citywide wireless system.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. So this is a referral.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So they want to hear.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Mayor, if it's Assistant City Attorney Alan Cohen could also address the issues about the the difference in legalities with the pubs authority in the City Council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. Members of the city council, Alan Cohen, Assistant City Attorney. I wanted to address the jurisdictional question about what council's authority is with regard to the Electric Utility Council's authority is very limited. And in fact, the charter in Article 12 gives the pub exclusive jurisdiction to manage the utility, to control and operate the utility, determine what'",
        "'speaker_7': 'services will be provided and how those services will be provided. That the Public Utilities Board in this area supersedes the Council. The council can't direct the Public Utilities Board on how to operate or implement its policies. The Council's role with regard to the Public Utilities Board is limited to appointing the members who who serve on the Public'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Utilities Board. But as far as the policy decisions made by the Public Utilities Board in the area of smart meters, the council does not have a role. Individual council members, just like any other member of the public, certainly could have the right to come to a public utilities board meeting and express their concerns.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the charter's very clear on this issue that that the people of the city of Alameda, when they passed that charter provision, gave the pub exclusive authority to manage the utility. And I'll also address the the issue of the city manager's authority in this regard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before we move on, could council give feedback? Without giving direction. Is there a way for us to weigh in at all?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the council could weigh in as individual members, but the council as a body could not pass a resolution or enact legislation basically directing POB to take specific action or even commenting on what what the council thinks that as a body the pub should take with regard to a particular matter, because that would constitute interference in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the authority granted to pub by the voters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So is there a mechanism where that we could receive the agenda in advance and give feedback somehow without going to the council meetings or the pub meeting?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, I think I think absolutely. I think the mechanism, the agendas are made public, just like the city council's agendas and how council can get put on the mailing list to receive the agenda. And if council individual council members have questions or concerns, you can certainly speak to the individual public utilities board members, including the city'",
        "'speaker_7': 'manager. There is there is a there's always a segment on the agenda. Actually, at every pub meeting where the city manager updates, the Public Utilities Board, updates the Public Utilities Board on particular concerns of the council, things that are going on that are under the council's ambit so that it would be perfectly appropriate for you to express'",
        "'speaker_7': 'your opinion to her member matter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could this Council make a request for information from the the. The MP. On some of the information that's been talked about tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the council could request information. I think the council could, for example.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To be specific. We've heard from members of the public about safety concerns from emissions from these smart meters. We've heard from the director of the of information comparative of the emissions to a cell phone. What I'm interested in is seeing this verification of these assertions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we have an issue and I'm perfectly fine going as an individual and talking to people, understanding what you just said, what I would like to know. Scientifically what the situation is also was asserted that there were fires related to the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we've got a bunch of smart meters out there. How many fires have we had related to them? So, you know, I'd like to get some some verifiable information from what I've heard just verbally today. I'm not asking for it now, but I'm asking the attorney if we could request it as part of this referral.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think you can request it informally as individuals. I don't think the body as a whole could could pass a resolution saying we want this particular piece of information. But the council has expressed each of you has expressed some concerns over this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think we could advise Jill, the city manager, could advise the public utilities board of those concerns and pub would would.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this council and every citizen can ask for information for, you know, any department. And so I think.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'What.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We should do with that information is make it public both for the council and the public.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you know, like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just to finish that is in the end, I think we have to do to to evaluate our risks are based on science. And, you know, when I heard about the citywide wi fi and then this, you know, it's just like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Give us some information, because if on one hand we're saying we're going to wi fi have the whole city wi fi enabled, and then on the other hand, we don't want a smart meter that may or may not.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, I haven't seen the publications that have been peer reviewed be be better or worse than this. We don't know. I can't reconcile those and we can't keep pointing to Washington that they ignore science and we ignore science ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I want I want peer reviewed. Information as an individual, but I'll take that offline. It sounds like we can't do that as a body.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's correct. That you cannot we could not give that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I think I think the idea is that information can be obtained and provided, but the council shouldn't be asking.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I would like copies of the information you sent to member matter. I see. And I think other councils may want copies. You should be able to give us all copies and then buy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Everything everybody else has.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. You can give us all copies of We Ask Questions of Vice Mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I have three questions really. And they really go, I think, mainly to Mr. Cohen. So my first question is one of the things in the charter has to do with City Council's ability to make decisions relative to litigation as it pertains to AMP.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could we. I think the underlying concern and what I've heard is also the liability aspect relative to potential litigation. So could we request information relative to our liability exposure?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Litigation is one of the areas that the council and pub share authority. Only the council can can authorize us to initiate litigation or, for example, to settle a lawsuit. So we certainly could provide that information in closed session.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the Public Utilities Board would also have to be. You have to be a joint session. They'd have to be invited to attend. But first they would have to be in order to get into closed session to provide their advice, there'd have to be a very realistic and significant exposure to litigation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't think we're at that point yet. Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let me just add that part of anything any decision that a body makes, it does risk assessment, and that that goes with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The pub's.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Authority on policy decisions and understanding the utility operations, new things that are going on in the world of the utility and making some decisions about risks. They have budget, they put together budgets, all of those kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, I mean, you could argue that everything really has a potential of some litigation at some point. But I think what Mr. Cohen is is getting at is if it gets to an actual real lawsuit or some claim, then that's when the city council has authority.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So going back to that question, does the city risk manager, who does the assessment of the risk? Because you're saying that there's a risk assessment that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, I think any decision that gets made, you try to determine I mean, you do it sitting up here as well. You try to determine what the potential downside could be of any decisions you make. And I guess that's what I was I was taking from your question about risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Assess my my.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Questions, I guess a little more nuanced and I'll be a little more specific. I think we've heard from some people that they're claiming certain they're making certain legal claims. Who does that assessment and at what point does it come to the council and what would we be considering?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, let me start, I think.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. So let me just preface this, because I think part of the concern, at least from our end or my end, I don't want to speak for my colleagues, is where we have this kind of split role with an appointed body.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know it's a little different because of different legal restrictions that exist surrounding municipal utilities. But at least for me and bear with me because I'm a new council member, I'm trying to understand where our role lies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, when you talk about potential litigation, Mr. Cohen just said it basically needs to be real. There needs to be something filed. So my question is kind of what's the lead up to that? Is there is there another assessment?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm sure there's another assessment done, but what's the lead up to that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think in terms of whether or not we have the authority to come to you and bring you in on a matter that involves part of that in a manner that involves significant exposure to litigation that comes from our office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This assessment is has a lawsuit. Clearly, if a lawsuit had been filed and we determined that the lawsuit was not meritorious and or we wanted to provide you with advice on that lawsuit, we would be we would do that in closed session with public and with the counsel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And counsel would ultimately have the authority to direct the city attorney in terms of the strategic handling of that lawsuit. Beyond that, I would say that sort of the day to day policy decisions are rest with the Public Utilities Board and AMP.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think it's perfectly appropriate for counsel to to to speak with the city manager and say, look, I want information in this area. And the city manager as as counsel's as one of the representatives on PCB will certainly convey that information to pop into AMP.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, when the counsel asks for information, you know, it's kind of hard to say no. So, yeah, of course, we'll we'll provide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That to you. If I can just add, I think part of what I'm hearing is really a health risk. Mm hmm. No municipal body is in an Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or I would I would.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Posture anywhere is in a position to determine what a health risk is. There are agencies that that do that. And I think what what the AMP executive or general managers is saying is the industry standards. And I know that's what you were trying to get at councilmember matter I see is the industry standards have not shown there'",
        "'speaker_3': 'is this connection. I understand the concern of the people who spoke today.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Health the health assessments that are done by agencies charged with and and with the experts who can address those issues have not shown that this is a problem. And I think AMP can share that with the council to show that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so there's no risk that connects to the health that would justify a claim.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'll add to that one one piece, if I may. I mean, the the body the body charged with determining whether or not transmissions are legal, not legal, whether or not they create a health risk, whether they're safe for the public.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is the Federal Communications Commission Federal Communications Commission sets emission standards. And, you know, I can let Nico speak to this, but but based on the evaluations that AMP has done, the emission standards on these smart meters are well below well below the standards set by the Federal Communications Commission.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so for that reason, it's your belief that there is no liability, legal liability, if if the technology were to change or studies were to come out that were different or the standards were to change, we would be doing another liability analysis from that, and that would be something that would the council be included in that decision'",
        "'speaker_0': 'relative not to the health risk, but to the legal exposure? Because my understanding is we that is what's within our jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's I was going to raise the objection of incomplete hypothetical.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But not to cross-examine.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This isn't the proper forum for that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Trying to understand.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If if there were a lawsuit filed if a and we felt that the lawsuit had some merit and that there was some liability exposure, that it's at that point, you know, under the auspices of our of our Sunshine Ordinance and the Brown Act, that we would feel that we would have the obligation to come to counsel in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'closed session, inform them of the liability risk and request authority one way or the other. But we're not at that point, I can tell you from from having attended all these public utilities board meetings on smart meters and working with with the general manager every day, POB is constantly studying this issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'AMP is constantly studying this issue and constantly, you know, reviewing these studies. And if ever rises to the point where there is a real scientifically, scientifically backed request that these are exposing people to liability. We'll come forward. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then I ended up getting derailed with a couple of follow up questions. But my other question is, you know, there is my my understanding is the AMP is continuously conducting its own studies and looking into this. So rather than the FOIA requests or public information requests, what's posted and available online?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because I think rather than having all of us kind of constantly put in requests or having the public what's available and where is it available?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So on our our web page, under our energy and view section, there is an FAA queue which is fairly detailed. It doesn't have a whole list of all relevant studies. It talks about the standards. It talks about some of the comparisons to other.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Emitting devices like cell phones. We do compare ourselves to other municipal utilities and how they structured their web pages and how they get that information out there. And we're pretty consistent with what they do as well. So and we certainly we certainly can provide information.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have access to those we've reviewed those scientific studies. I mean, I think that Allen really highlighted it, that we go by what the regulatory standards are. Now, having said that, I think one of the benefits of having a municipal utility, a community owned utility, is we're not puny.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if something should change in the in the regulatory environment, we're going to adjust very quickly. It's not going to be a situation where we're going to actually he's going to have to get involved because we'll take it right to the pub and make any changes necessary based on those new regulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then two council member moderates his earlier question regarding this, the public Wi-Fi, things like that. I know it was said that we can't request information of the pub relative to a pub policy. But if the city's thinking about enacting policy relative to public Wi-Fi or smart cities, you know, one of the things that's unique about'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Alameda is that we have this resource, which is AMP, which is city owned, which has done studies. In those instances, could we request information that an app has relied on to help inform our decisions on policies that are within our jurisdiction?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But. Not. And not within the jurisdiction of the pub.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You want to you want to share? I don't think that's a legal issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, because I feel like, you know, part of the question is also why duplicate the work or why go out and hire somebody to do this work when we are doing it already? Could we could we request the information in that instance where it might be relevant to a decision that we're making.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're happy to collaborate with whichever department is going to be charged on point for that? Certainly, we've done a lot related to this particular issue. So I think we don't want to duplicate efforts and we do that on a regular basis for a variety of issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. My final question, I promise, is the last one is, you know, the concern that we're hearing and you had spoken earlier about things that the public is considering. One thing that has been raised has been these multifamily buildings and the potential impact where there might be a number or a bank of smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can you speak a little bit about what the pub has done relative to the analysis of that and, you know, just the impact of it? Because that seems to be kind of a recurring theme.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we don't really differentiate between a single meter and multiple meters. Again, I'll fall back to the regulatory standards. So if if there was a potential issue associated with that, then that would flow through some sort of regulatory standard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now that standard isn't there. It hasn't been established. One thing that's important to note about these meters is these meters. They're designed to go in one direction. They want to get to a device that will able to relay that information down the line and then get it aggregated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they typically don't they're not like a wireless network in your home, which is kind of 360 degrees. They kind of they go in one direction. They're not going back into the house. So they're really going out. Now, we haven't gone in and done measurements in in houses or in an apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But based on the regulatory standards, there's nothing that would lead us to believe that there's or would make any adjustments or a special dispensation, I guess, for a meter bank or multiple meters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other questions or comments from Council Member Ashcraft?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is more of a. Comment I think we've gotten some useful information about the council has in the form of emails from the city manager but about these comparative levels of of emissions or EMF from devices. What I think would be helpful because more information.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Properly distilled is is better than less is to be able to put that out to the public in a number of formats that you don't have to search too hard to find. So while I appreciate that AMP has effects on your website, we have a public information officer.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can do an opinion piece in the in the newspaper and actually at the five K the other day I happened to be race walking with and MacCormack who's the public utilities board chair right now. And we we kept up a running conversation and I told her, you know, I think it might be useful to put it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'when I know there's an important meeting on Monday. But when some of those decisions are made, share it as widely as possible, I think that's important. And part of the problem that we all deal with his there is sometimes an abundance of information out there, the quality of the information in and this is where my scientist colleague'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Frank Materazzi you know, and he talks about he wants it published in peer reviewed because there's data and there's data. And but I think to the extent that we can be the purveyors of the information that we know to our own residents, we do a great public service.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it it helps, I think, all of us as council members. So and then sometimes there is misinformation in it. I'm not up on everything. But with regard to if the reference was to the recent North Bay fires and Peggy's involvement, I thought that had to do with transformers blowing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Maybe it was smart meters, but it's good to just know, you know, as much information as possible.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I haven't heard that it was a smart route heater related issue up there. And in fact, I think they're still investigating. So I'm not going to weighed in on that issue there. There was an issue in Stockton involving, I think, 5000 meters.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They had a power surge. It was a somewhat unique situation in terms of what was happening on the distribution grid. My understanding we actually talked to our engineers about this is that that what happened with those meters would have pretty much happened with any meter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's not specific to smart meters.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what happened with the meters?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The meters, some of them essentially blew out of their socket. So and it was the way that they have their system configured. The nature of the surge, very unusual. It's not something that we would anticipate on our system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But again, the meters, whatever meter, if the old meters were in there, they expected they would have had a similar situation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Vice Mayor So one of the other things that got brought up is we are a different body obviously than the pub for contact information for members of the pub. If members of the public are trying to have a conversation or want to convey a concern.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How do they how do they go about doing that? Because on our city website for the Public Utilities Board, it gives contact information for Robin, her phone number, and then an email address for Robin. But there's no contact information for the individual board members provided on this is on our city website.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There is a pub mailing list and we get those on a regular basis and then we will distribute those to the hub members. And I believe that's on our web and anything that goes to Robin, he's my executive assistant.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Anything that goes to her that's addressed to the pub will then get distributed to me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is it possible to set up city email accounts for our pub members, individual ones where they because they're not, it's just and if we have them, it's just not it's not posted online. But to me, this is an access issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we're not making the decisions and they're the ones making the decisions. I just want to make sure that if you can't make it to the pub meeting, you can still get a hold of one of the board members and and share whatever your concerns may be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, absolutely. We can do that. And one thing I wanted to note also on Monday, in addition to this item, the lifting of the sunset provision, we are actually having an army update to the pub and it's just by chance that this is occurring at the same time as this referral.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's amaz what do you have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About advanced.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Advanced meter infrastructure, smart meters, smart meter updates? And it's it's going to cover a whole host of different issues, not really this issue, but the privacy issue, which was mentioned by one of the other speakers, is something that will touch upon that as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So certainly there's interest. We welcome it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I have some questions. So we had comments about the march, a potential moratorium that these other cities have done that. Is it possible, for example, to find out what about. That would be one of my requests to find out what other cities and counties have had a moratorium who currently have a moratorium and then share that'",
        "'speaker_2': 'information. And has AMP had a an agenda item where they had a discussion about these health concerns, given the public an opportunity to speak at an AMP meeting and discuss a potential moratorium at AMP, do that. Has that happened?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not to my knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So then as an individual or the public. So has there been a petition started by the public in regards to this? Have you heard of a petition for Alameda? Okay. So that's something else our community could do to communicate the interest in our town on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And then in regards to the smart meters at the apartment buildings, is there something that can be added somehow around these meters or something to reduce any potential RF to the residents? Is there anything that can be done to make them safer?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Aware physically.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm not aware of anything that can be added or any utilities who are adding something we can certainly look sound like quite right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I would like to know if there's a way to add some kind of physical something barrier behind these meters where they're against a wall that goes to someone's home. Or in in some sort of an apartment building or we have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. And some of this and I appreciate that a lot of this is needs to be data driven. Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't actually end up with something that we say is so black and white that everyone is going to agree until ten or 20 years down the road.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When we look back and we say, oh, yeah, we now know that that did contribute. So if there's anything that we know or we think could actually help reduce the exposure, I'd like to know what that is. If if you have any information that goes to that, that would be helpful to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other questions on this? All right. And I also want to thank you, really, because I know you're going to be both of you going back to you've already said on the next agenda item on Monday. It is going to be coming up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you very much for revisiting that. And I look forward to hearing the vote from the p b on these issues. Thank you very much. Okay. So I think that dispenses with our referral, so thank you. And then there's one more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Referral nine B 90 is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'"
