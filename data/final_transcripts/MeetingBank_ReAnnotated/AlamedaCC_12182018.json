        "'speaker_1': 'All those opposed. I oppose. Others abstain. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like a little discussion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Let's have discussion. All right. And then I have. Yes. So did you want to make some comments?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I made a point of order. That motion goes down. Correct. Because we had a motion. We voted. There were two. A yes and a no and silence.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we haven't finished counting votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm happy to. Okay, so I'll go to our clerk. City clerk, do you want to tell us where we are in regards to the last motion when we had a request to have some discussion during the vote?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that the people who didn't make a vote yet wanted to have discussion prior to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The motion failed then? Or is that just like back to where we're discussion discussing the motion?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think it's up to you guys because you didn't have a full voting motion to reconsider. We need to have it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It would have to be something.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm okay acting as though the motion failed because. That's right. I'll go ahead with that. But then could we have a motion to reconsider that then? If you want to move it so moved. All right, I'll second that.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. I just wanna make sure you understand where we are. Frank, I'm not. You're confused. So his motion had already know his version had already failed.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'At the beginning. Okay. So, are you making a motion for reconsideration? I will second the vice mayors motion. I thought we already did that. Yeah, we're actually on the motion and we can discuss. We're clear. When you made your emotions, I assumed it was the most recent motion, not the original motion.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just would like some discussion, I think. You know, I guess my concern and we've we've discussed this is an issue of making sure that we have continued legal counsel as we transition into the new council and that we don't have an absence of a city attorney.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that that's a primary concern, at least for me. If the mayor could elaborate on her concerns. I would appreciate hearing them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm not. Can I take a recess to ask you about? I can say on the record publicly. Okay. So I'm going to take a short recess and ask our legal counsel what I can say on the record.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'While I appreciate the concept of continuity. My first concern when hiring any employee has always been their ability to do their job at serving our city. And I have concerns in regards to that. And to me that has to be the primary focus when I'm hiring any employee for our city.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'But I don't expect to always agree with our city attorney, but I do expect a clear and open line of communication for as long as he is our if he is our acting. And I felt that I had that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And anyway, I also well, I won't go beyond that. But anyway, that's it. Thank you, though, for the motion to reconsider and I'm happy to offer. I also disagreed with the advice and there are been other issues that I've that where I've disagreed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Any other comments from council? So the motion to recommend to approve the agreement appointing Michael Roush is the motion that I will now call the question on. All those in favor. I, I oppose and I oppose. Motion carries for two one.'",

And it's interesting that they chose justice this year in a year filled with negativity, a disaster every week, manmade nature made and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'whatever made. And we've just been crushed with all kinds of negativity and bad things happening. And for Merriam-Webster dictionary to say the most looked up word is the word justice. What is justice? And so it's very hopeful to say that people are looking up things.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'So they turned down that proposal in the same report. They said they found another location and they approved that proposal at Webster and Haight Street. They did not look next door to that location and find a youth center, a martial arts school which serves predominantly children.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know why they missed that when they could look almost a thousand feet away and see Ruby stumbling and say, that's a youth center and not see right next door that that's a youth center. And so they approved that proposal.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Let's look at that all the buffer zones and fix them. If it's a problem, they said no, let's just exercise the martial arts school from the definition of a youth center. And to me, that is patently unjust and not fair.'",

Over the last two years, the thing that I've been coming to speak in front of you guys, something very interesting has happened. I've lived here for 14 years. I, like many of the meetings I've run across, paid attention to certain things that showed up in my ballot box over'",

I want to say, and I said last time, that one third of our population is either lightly concerned about this or as we've seen some some of our neighbors deeply concerned about this issue'",

I would like to express my personal opinions on the future of adult cannabis use and sales within the city of Alameda. 68.3. That may be the wrong number of Alameda vote approved adult use in a statewide election.'",

So why has the city council worked so hard to delay and limit access to cannabis to Alameda citizens? I will only briefly mention the serious injury caused medical users when the city closed our original medical dispensary.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We continue to hear the same arguments that were used before the vote, and we're not considered true or sufficient cause to not legalize adult cannabis use. Marijuana is safer than alcohol. Statistics will show that alcohol causes more deaths on the roadway.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The few accidents where marijuana is mentioned as a contributing factor, it is just that a contributing factor. In virtually all other cases, drugs, other drugs or alcohol were responsible. The true danger of stoned drivers is that they drive slowly.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'There's nothing wrong with the conversation and discussion. So it's been two years of that and I've been thankful to have been a part of it since since day one. I've been I've been on this island pretty much my whole life for 33 years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I live on the West End. I'm a homeowner, muso, a father of two. We're actually a local business known to have a couple of businesses on Webster Street and actually live very, very close to Webster Street. And I'm also one of the founding members of the local physical element for safe cannabis access.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want to add, I'm looking around this room, too. I'm I view myself as like kind of the younger generation of the next generation. I get a three year old, my daughter's two years. And cannabis has been a part of my life since I was my teenage years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. It's there's access to this product already. And if if we're going to really want to do something positive, do something great for this is not that difficult. These businesses have really, really strict laws and rules and they have to, you know, do business by.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if we're happy in this town with all these bars in town, trust me, I'd rather have dispensaries in town versus all these bars because alcohol I've seen it all. They smoked cigarets in the front of the truck, in the front of my Webster doing business.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'People are getting arrested all the time, you know, for for DUI, drinking, drinking in public. So, again, it's it's not that you don't don't worry about it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. Good afternoon. I'm a Alameda resident and also the manager of International Cheating Schedule. We are the muscle school next to the first potential dolphin. And I would like to say for pop 64 when California western and will yes there is a sentence say they would be above a song 600 feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Which would protect you censure. And the definition of your center is already in California law. When we in Alameda when the city wanted changed that definition is actually a violation of California law. And it's not fair for California residents when we will.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. In part 64 and other setting, you guys changed definition and there is no protection at all. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes that completes our public speakers. I want to turn to our city attorney. There is an issue just raised that that I'm considering a clarification of. The definition of use centers is a violation of California law.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Could you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm going to ask my colleague John Lee to step up and address that. I can I can say, as John is coming up, that I believe that our analysis is that it's not a violation of a state law, that the state has given us the authority to adopt our own interpretation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. And if you could introduce yourself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. John Lee, Assistant Senator. Madam Mayor, members of the council. Members of the public. Yes, that's correct. I don't I don't have much to add. I I think I've discussed this before.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the past with you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That the state does have a default rule, but it does provide for the ability of local jurisdictions to decide for themselves. And I think I've mentioned in the past that the Bureau of Cannabis Control also views it that way, and they've made public statements to that effect.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you could just so you said it's the default position of the city, but the city could correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And but since the city has already acted on and decided what it is that they believe to be the appropriate buffer zones, and that's what governs that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What is your legal opinion?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That this does not violate California law? Correct. Thank you. A question for Mr. Lee Ashcroft. So, Mr. Lay, you're talking about the buffer zone. Are you suggesting that we've reduced or eliminated the buffer zone between the martial arts studio and the proposed cannabis retail business next door?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't think it was about buffer zone. I thought it was about removing that particular use from the definition of use center. I'm sorry. Before you answer that, I want to keep us at the policy level. It's my understanding we're not actually speaking in regards to one specific business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're being asked to adopt policy. And Mayor Spencer, with all due respect, I'm simply asking for clarification of what I just wanted to make sure we're saying at the policy level. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I believe that it falls within sort of the same umbrella. And so the determination as to what the buffer should be is also similar to determining what sort of the the scope of the protected.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sort of classes or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Maybe that's a better not a good way to describe it, but the sensitive uses that should be protected. Just as, for example, the council made determinations about churches and parks. It's a it's a similar sort of land use type question that I think is appropriate for the council to consider.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice Mayor were the words martial arts center in our definition of protected youth center.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The original definition? No.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the carve out, obviously. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What do you mean the carve out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where we specifically excluded martial arts and other.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the statement that we somehow overlooked the martial arts center at the end of July. It wasn't in the definition in July, was it? It was its martial arts center. Were they in the original definition of youth center?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It was not in the original definition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Lane What other follow up question? Was there a challenge filed relative to the definition of youth center soon after? When was the challenge filed?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm leaving the to the dogs, he complained, or I'm not clear the challenge you're referring to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There was a a. Was there ever a challenge to the definition of you center filed?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not that I'm aware of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I misspoke. I'm just coming out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening. I'm Debbie Potter, the city's based reuse and community development director. The way the issue was brought to our attention was when Mrs. Chen sent an email to the city council members and to staff, pointing out that there was a martial arts studio next door to the.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And when was that? The last couple of months.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a couple of months after the original RFP was completed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right, that the RFP process wrapped up in May. So this was. Yeah, four or five months after that process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And following member Ashcraft was the term Tambling Center included in our original ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Not in those words, no.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how did it come to be if the characterization from his chin was correct that the determination was made not to locate a cannabis retail business on Park Street because of its proximity to Ruby's Tambling?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, no, that's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. I think staff may have made a determination. I wasn't a part of that, so I can't speak to that. I apologize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. This part. Would you like to elaborate on that for us? Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff considered the tumbling center a sensitive use from the beginning, not because it was a tumbling center, but because it exclusively serves minors. And that's the distinction that has been carried over. That concept has been carried over to the revised definition that the council approved several weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'QUESTION Mr. Ashcroft. So, Miss Potter, in this staff report on this item. It is noted that the recreation Parks Department had asked has asked to have its facilities designated as U.S. centers. But isn't it true that if I look in the Recreation Parks Department activity guide, they offer classes for both adults and youth out of the same'",
        "'speaker_1': 'facilities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the the correct the rec and park just the ability for rec and park to designate a youth center under the ordinance has been in the ordinance since the beginning and it allows the Rec and Park Department to request or make a request that a a community center be designated a youth center.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That is not happened to date. The Rec and Park Department has not made any such requests so far as we've moved through this process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But doesn't the protection exist for it? And the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The ordinance does continue to say under the definition of youth center, that if the Park and Rec Department wants to designate one of its community centers within a public park, it can do so. We did not take away that that ability as part of the recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And just. Mayor Ashcroft, thank you. So I'm just for clarification. Why would that same right not be afforded to, for instance, the the martial arts center on Webster Street?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So I think this was the discussion that the council had several weeks ago when they considered the first reading of this ordinance. And I think the decision was to keep the changes narrow and to respect the definition as it stood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When that deaf as that definition is curt was currently or at the time was memorialized. And so there was some brief discussion about whether or not there was a desire to remove those protections for the Rec and Park Department community centers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And the council declined to do that. And so that that's the way the definition stands. And I believe the definition stands because the council wanted to continue to to respect I believe originally this was council members made a proposal to to take into account and address the youth centers at the community centers, at the parks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So is our only just choice between removing that protection from the recreation park department facilities as well? Or could our choice also be to expand it to a private business if it could be established that a certain threshold percentage of the clients or the students were youth?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The council could absolutely revise the definition to reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Potter. Mr. Potter, could you explain why staff's recommendation was to use exclusively in regards to implementation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the recommendation to council to look at youth centers as exclusively serving minors was in part an ability to do enforcement and to be able to document consistently and clearly and understand as that situation changes over time, that if you were to take a definition that of predominantly that the predominantly serving was ambiguous was what staff said'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to counsel on the staff report when it comes to trying to enforce the definition of a youth center and that the enforcement becomes a challenge in terms of how do we document that, how do we research it, what kind of reliance do we do?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then on an ongoing basis, how do we ensure consistency across the city and across to the various businesses? So in an abundance of know treating a desire to treat all the businesses equally. Staff is recommending that we have a definition of a youth center that is that one that serves exclusively minors.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then for further clarity, there was a carve out of the martial arts and other recreational type businesses, and that was due in part to just wanting to be clear that whether you but whether you serve, you know, 20% students, 30%, 40%, we are clear that that they don't rise to the level of a sensitive use.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Member.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ready.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody, for comments. I'll be brief. Oh, well, I'm of approval of the item and then make some brief comments. And I'll try to be brief, because I think this may be the ninth time that we've had a discussion on cannabis and maybe ten.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of the motion. Sorry. Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It maybe ten or 11, if you count like the two times we banned it way back three years ago after the state passed their the rules. So I'm not going to repeat too much what I said last time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that this was an attempt to put a de facto ban in, and I think it also helps clarify some of our regulations for staff has applications come through. So I'm happy to support this again. But, you know, on the on the issue of justice, I mean, this is an issue of justice.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm glad that that word was brought up because it's a justice matter for the hundreds, maybe thousands of young men and women of color who were put in jail for something that's now illegal and who now, you know, used to make money off of something and were arrested for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And now see other people that are not young men and women of color making money off of it. So I think it's a matter of justice there. It's a matter of justice for, you know, cancer and other patients that need access to medicine that have been denied that medicine by the federal government and by some of these'",
        "'speaker_4': 'archaic policies. It's a matter of justice for all comedians who would like to be able to shop on their own island and not expand greenhouse gases to go to other places. It's a matter of of of justice for adult use pay our users that we've decided in the ultimate wisdom of our voters that that's a right that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we all should have as Californians. So I appreciate also, mark, your letter or your comment to the editor, because I think it's important to compare, you know, what actually is going to happen if a child or a youth tries to get into one of these things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I think you laid it out clear that unlike a liquor store or a place where Cigarets are sold, you're not going to see on the front door or a sign or even in the windows that cannabis products are being sold.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here you walk down any of our main streets and you see the Bud Light and the, you know, Miller Light and the cigaret advertising in the window. So, you know, you can get that there, but you're not going to see that in a cannabis dispensary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the appeal to a young person is not going to be there. So then if they go in, a young person can walk into any of those establishments where liquor and where cigarets and tobacco products are sold. They can't do that in a cannabis dispensary because they're being checked in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So let's just assume they do get through the front door so they can't even buy anything because there's a point of sale registration. So if you buy a product and Mark, you spelled this out, if you buy a product, the government, big brother knows that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm not going to do this but me. Jim Odey bought product x, y, z. Okay. If a youth person gets into another store that liquor or cigarets are sold, we're not going to know. We're just not going to know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they could put one of those things in their pocket, you know, and shoplifted for all we know, and that I'll never get out there. And then, you know, if there's a straw purchaser, if somebody goes in, you know, anybody over 21 could buy cigarets or or liquor and give it to some kid.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if that kid is caught and we don't know where that came from, we don't know who bought that. But if that happened in a in a dispensary, you could be able to track the the barcode on that product.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you would know, you know, that, for example, my husband bought that product and that youth had that had that product on his person. And then you would be just using it as an example and you'd be able to go to the person who bought it and you could arrest them or charge them with every violation that'",
        "'speaker_4': ', that, that they've committed. So I think let's just be clear as we talk about this, that there is not going to be this tremendous access to cannabis by our young people. They are not going to be able to get in like they can get into a liquor store, they can get into a convenience mart and buy a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pack of cigarets. So let's just make sure those myths are clear. And I just want to make sure that it was clarified. And I appreciate, Mark, you you putting that information in the newspaper so everyone can have a little bit more information because like I said a couple meetings ago, I was under informed on this issue for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a long time. And I appreciate you helping improve people's intelligence on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Vice mayor. I think it's also an issue of, you know, we talked about notice this RFP ended in May. There was a staff report in July. The complaint about the definition didn't happen for a couple months. And I just think that at a certain point, people that are trying to start a business were also trying to engage'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in economic development on a number of different fronts here in Alameda. And people need notice. They need to know where to purchase property or where they shouldn't purchase property or lease property. And from that standpoint, it's not just about enforcement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If we have a definition that can continuously be expanded months after RFP. I think it's very difficult for any business owner or investor to make a decision about where to locate because it could potentially always be challenged and there could be another business that or business type that that comes out of the woodwork with somebody raising a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'claim months after the fact. And that was the case here. I also think that there's you know, I encourage people to look up on Google Maps. You can pull every liquor license in Alameda and every tobacco resale license and every pharmacy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I have a friend from high school right now who's in a coma. He's in a coma because he became an opioid addict while he was undergoing cancer treatment. He was a star athlete in Alameda. He was a star baseball player.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He was my husband's best friend growing up from the time they were in preschool, all the way still to this day. And he's he's lying in a coma because addiction to opioids got to him. And it wasn't cannabis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He didn't have access to cannabis when he was going through his cancer treatments, he had a prescription to a an opioid that became extremely addictive. And it led to his downfall. And he's probably going to die in a few days.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Those are the things that we're trying to prevent through a regulated business model. And I think that Alameda is trying to do that and we're trying to do that keeping in mind all of the different businesses that exist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, there was a comment about, you know, sure, you can have this just far, far away from my kid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's all over the place. It's not that, you know, we can say we're not going to sell it here or we're going to sell it, you know, over in this corner of the island. But if you look at the map of the areas that we're actually allowing sales, there's not a lot of properties in those in those'",
        "'speaker_3': 'limited areas. And they are far away from places like the Boys and Girls Club, places like schools, something that's not true of liquor stores, something that's not true of tobacco retailers. And I think that we're trying to walk that line of being responsible in terms of where we locate businesses and being thoughtful and trying to keep it'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at a distance from certain places like schools and things like that. But these are not businesses that children can walk into. It's not a liquor store where a child can walk in and purchase it. And in fact, when it is purchased in order to leave the store, you have to have a childproof bag.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the bag itself makes it difficult to access the item. And all of these precautions are being put under way. And I think that we're trying to make sure that whatever we do is done in a thoughtful manner.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I'm ready to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amber Ashcraft comments. And thank you all for your comments. And I mean, at the outset, I don't oppose cannabis businesses in Alameda and I have supported a lot of the ordinances. My only objection tonight is has to do with the change of the youth center definition.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I find it very troubling. I find it tantamount to spot zoning to accommodate a specific location. And in fact, we are not continuously expanding a definition. Months later, months later, we have narrowed a definition and at the same time we have preserved that definition for the two recreation park department facilities.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is my concern and I would have preferred some sort of compromise that also gave equal respect and weight to the concerns of the other side. And I know that a lot of you in the cannabis industry have worked very hard to do just that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I am concerned with good governance and transparency of perception, and especially coming on the heels of the Open Government Commission finding there was just reaffirmed last night that an agenda item adding two delivery only dispensaries that somehow morphed into adding two more retail dispensaries in Alameda was not adequately noticed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just I'm concerned that a number of the parents and business owners who have come and expressed their concerns with this particular location are not native English speakers, that they are more challenged than those of us who are in expressing their concerns and yet their concerns as residents, as business owners, as parents are just as valid'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I don't dispute for 1/2 your concerns with the medical aspects of cannabis. I firmly believe in that and I want to see this industry to succeed here. But I do think that we don't do ourselves in a favor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the end, if we look like we came to this conclusion by circuitous means. So going forward, I'm really going to hope that we all can get together and maybe sit together at the same table and hear our differences, our concerns, and address them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's you know, we could go on and on. Of course, there's safeguards and whatnot, but it is this change in the definition of youth center. That is the reason I can't support this item tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm just going to say what I said last time. I think that the carve out especially is a big pointer to spot zoning. And I think the going back to the node notification on this, that's a separate issue, but it just provides more mud to slog through on this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's better to leave the definition as it stands and run the process through and use that to inform what we do next. So I can't support this change tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I do plan to support this and I don't consider it a change. I consider it a clarification to assist staff in implementing it. I actually think it's very important that we. Use those words because. We're not making any changes as we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've been speaking openly about these issues for two years. All of this has been on the table and publicly discussed. Pros and cons. And I appreciate all of you that have come out and expressed your concerns and especially those of you that have shared your personal stories of.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think this is. And I you know, I disagree with any suggestion that this is part zoning or any securities efforts. Honestly, anything I would suggest that this is obfuscation, these concerns, the time after time we have people come with some reason why they don't want a dispensary somewhere.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'State law. Is that the default on state law. Is 600 feet from schools. So we had the same people come and say they didn't want 600 feet. They wanted 1000 feet, which is actually was two thirds, 66% more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm doing my math. Right. It's a significant amount of space considering we're on an island. So so if some of you that had are coming now and said before, you know, I do want the default position, I fully support the state on the 600 feet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I fully support the state on their use definition. But that's not what I heard. The same people, unfortunately, have said they don't want 600 feet, they want 2000, but they want to use the used default position from the state.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we are an island. So at some point, unfortunately, it appears that whether or not you claim to support cannabis, that truly you don't want any dispensaries here on the island. And unfortunately, when I and I've shared this before, when I moved here, we had I was a little surprised to see an alcohol store retailer right across'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the street from Alameda High. And yet I've had multiple times someone that was very involved in our schools come here and expressed concerns about cannabis. And yet. RS I know that this never happened when we talked about alcohol, you know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So to me, I am concerned that in fact, this isn't about the definition or spot zoning or secured as anything. It's actually about not supporting dispensaries. I fully support having dispensaries. I have also heard the stories from people that grew up in this town that did buy cannabis on the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And two women have told me they can't remember three days of their lives and they woke up because unfortunately it wasn't pure. There was something in it. So and by the way, it is available for sale here. It's just not lab tested.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When we first moved here, there was a sale occurring by Lincoln Park. It does happen. And everyone, parents, children. We are trying to make it safe and access fear that is lab tested, not purchased on the street. I've told before when my daughter went to school and work came and he'd been pissed over, the sale had gone'",
        "'speaker_1': 'bad. So we're trying to get rid of that. We're trying to clean that up. We're trying to clean up this town. At the end of the day, we're trying to clean up this town. There's a problem. And so we're here trying to help.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I want to thank Councilmember O.D. Vice Mayor Melia Vella. They have joined me in this effort. Any suggestion that there's been any other council member that has worked for this is not true. It is US three that have worked really, really hard on this issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I fully support. I'm very grateful because this has become a personal cause for me. If you'd asked me 20 years ago, would I be sitting here being this advocate? No. But as many of you have heard, fortunately I have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm a cancer survivor last 11 years. And I get to see and I have offered, if anyone wants to go to the cancer center with me and see patients, see what we really look like. And yes, we are trying to avoid the opioid track where, yes, they do give us opioids.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're happy to give us opioids to deal with the side effects. We have to do it better as a society. And that's what Alameda is really good at, doing things better. I'm confident that if anyone can figure out how we are going to serve our public safely, including our children.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's. It's us. We're going to do it. We are going to do it. I want to thank our businesses that are have come out, our health professionals that have come out. And I'm confident you're going to stay in the conversation and make sure that we do it the best.'",
