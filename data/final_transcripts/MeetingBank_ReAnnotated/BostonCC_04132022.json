        "'speaker_7': 'I do share my colleague's concern about the geographic spread of of the allocation across the city. But part of that is I know from my experience and also in Brighton, I have a list of the back of my paper here of things that possibly would be eligible for some EPA money.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But very often it is. You need community groups, you need people who are volunteers, your historic society or your neighborhood groups to really dig in and do the work to prepare these presentations. So I hope that we can ensure that community groups all across the city or our neighborhoods that need support, technical support and guidance.'",

Look over the eligibility and create a list of eligible organizations and schools that didn't have access to these resources so that we can send a letter to those offices. I wanted to offer that to my colleagues because it's just we know it became it was evident to me as well as'",

        "'speaker_2': 'But our hope is that by sending kind of like a mail in letter and maybe doing some phone banking to like make calls to people to just let them know and having some of the community meetings that you just mentioned that it would increase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Access and just knowledge of the CPA program. I know that there are still going to be barriers because it is a grant. And although you don't have to be a grant writer to write it, you still have to have some sort of knowledge like council and said to put it together.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I think that letting people know about it is a good first step so we can actually ultimately see what the what the need is for more technical assistance and make sure that they, Dean and the CPA office, has all of the resources that they need to run the program effectively.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'administrations ago, depending on how you keep track of it. So I would just say that part of my consideration in the way that the doctor was originally written is the fact that this is phased in so that we don't immediately just take everybody who's on the school committee and say out with all of you and move forward'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in that way. It phases in the elected approach so that you're not looking at a fully elected school committee until 2026, and it's working in stages to get to there. So you get some of the new elected seats every municipal election up until the 2025 municipal election.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Obviously, all of these things can be discussed in a working session and sort of ironed out with folks. But the idea here was how do we do this in a responsible way? You know, voters haven't voted for a school committee in 30 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So you have to get the education that that's actually the thing on the ballot. Then you have to have all of these sort of races planned out in terms of making sure that all of the the actual infrastructural things are ready to go.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I see. I want one of those in my district and we're going to be able to do that. We're going to be able to take that model and replicate it because it's not just like when I was growing up, it was all sports.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was that was the only outlet you had. We weren't thinking about we weren't thinking of singing. We weren't thinking of poetry. It's all different here now. There's so many different ways to form the child. This building is going to form.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The child is going to form. The community. And the most important thing that I heard last night was from a young kid that said, we want to add to the good in the world. This is going to add to the good in the world.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why it's a formal request for $10 million across the hall to say, look at it. Pay attention to it. This is the way we should be spending our ARPA dollars. And I don't you know, I don't want to poo poo on any other way that we're spending ARPA dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't necessarily agree with a lot of it because I think it's going to feel like a Vegas weekend when we're done that pockets are empty, we got nothing to show for it. Right. I want to be able to point to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Look at this thing right here, $10 Million. You know, we won in Vegas. We hit it craps. I'm bringing 100,000 home or whatever. You know what I'm saying? Making the analogy. I don't want to feel like we went to Vegas and it's all gone.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'So in this tired of me standing up, that's why he's trying to silence me. You know that's not going to happen. So I just quickly wanted to say, and I really do appreciate Councilor Baker's advocacy on behalf of this particular project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also would be remiss if I didn't mention that there was a little bit of a controversy in regards to this very specific piece of land. The McCormick students, the faculty and some of the folks really wanted to keep that space green and there is some tension there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think it's important for us as we continue to move forward in this conversation that, you know, in the true spirit of really reflecting community voice, that we, you know, we honor that and we just uplift it because that is definitely something that was said in the presidency or that community voice is also being overlooked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I just wanted to name that. And while I appreciate, you know, the whole vision of what the city could look like ten years from now, I also want to be 100% that the city, what it's going to look like ten years from now is not going to be a lot of us being able to go to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this beautiful community center that that we're fighting for, because we're not going to be able to afford to live here in the city. So I think that while it's really beautiful and I'm excited to to support this initiative, I think it's also important for me to uplift.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The fact of the matter is, is that every day the city changes and the beauty, the beautiful things that we're fighting for, most likely most of our people are not going to be able to benefit from it. So while I support this project, I want to do so with naming that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Here, the chair recognizes Councilor Murphy. Councilor Murphy, you have the floor.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Counselor Bach and Counselor Baker for holding this hearing last night. Those students were extremely impressive. I have obviously a bias for some of the students. I'm a McCormick kid myself, and a lot of McCormick kids were here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I played basketball, track and field at McCormick because we didn't have a good track. We didn't have our own track. At McCormick, we had to use RBC High's track, right? A private school.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In. But we also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Use the outdoor area for recess. And I think that it's important as we look at this project, to also think about the outdoor space and how we can maintain as much outdoor space as possible for the McCormick kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's also the issue of McCormick is merging with Buchla. That's going to add a lot more students to the campus, students who should be able to access the outdoors pretty freely. I'm also really encouraged by a memorandum of agreement that will exist between the project and the school so that we make sure that our our students in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the area, both in the DeVry, the McCormick, BCA and McCormick UCLA, are able to access the site in a welcoming and and fully accessible way. So I look forward to further discussions about this project and also to honoring the voices of those who live in Columbia Point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They also presented a letter before the BPA announcing some of their concerns, which I think that we just need to take into account when we're considering this project. I also think, Councilor Baker, because last night, one of the things that he mentioned was that this project is a it could be a really great project in response to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the reckoning that we are having and experiencing here in our city and in the country, trying to find spaces where we can find common ground. I think this project, especially with the use of ARPA funds, would really create a precedent and I think that is a precedent that I'd like to see a lot of our communities, especially'",
        "'speaker_2': 'communities of color use and how we're sending and supporting private initiatives, even though it's a nonprofit, it's not it's not a public initiative. And then, yeah, I think something else that was said was we should be creating beautiful buildings as a city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can do that. We have the capacity to do that. And I'd like to see us build more beautiful buildings that really honor and affirm the dignity of all of our young ones. We as a city have the capacity and ability to do that with the land that is in within our purview.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to I want to see us doing more of that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, counsel. And the chair recognizes counsel. Flannery Council. Flannery, you have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just want to go on record and support, strong support of this. And I think it's important to note that both of these organizations have a stellar track record in delivering real deliverables to children and to families in Dorchester.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I referenced at the hearing it's a it's a it's a gem of a location. You think about the Columbia Point housing project across the street, depending on who's golfing. It's a five iron from the memorial. McCormick, where I was born.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The old have a projects, right? Think about the partnerships with the McCormack and the Devore BC High UMass. All the jobs that are going to be coming online at the Bayside Expo. Don't forget the Geiger Gibson Community Health Center there and the the plan to revitalize the JFK train station.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So lots of opportunity down there if there's ever an organization or partnership that is going to help close these gaps. We're looking at them. And I think it's also important to note the the author or the first speaker did mention that the collective partnerships, both in the private and public sector, that this this ask there are there'",
        "'speaker_4': 'are matches that are lined up with that match. To put this in a shovel ready position, which is what clearly we want to make sure that happens. So, I mean, if you can think about what is sort of been in front of me and my team in terms of the future of that peninsula, it's absolutely amazing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And to think about the pipelines that are coming from these schools to those other institutions to those jobs, particularly in the STEM field, will be servicing these kids in the sort of the first two priorities will be the high point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The housing development in just on the other side of the circle will be kids from the Marilyn McCormack I mean sky is the limit that not not hard to get excited about this so I think this will be it's a modest request frankly particularly given that the matches that are lined up to make this a reality for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the folks over there on Mount Vernon Street and for futures to come, you know, the track record of these organizations, not fly by night, not Johnny come lately is not mediocre kicking butt in their respective fields.

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Councilor Baker, thank you so much for actually filing this. And. And before I go in to talk about why I support the project, I go back to my point about, you know, it's it's so it's one thing to actually know that there's a disparity in certain areas, but it's another than to have to get people'",
        "'speaker_6': 'on technicalities or bureaucratic processes before you can have access. So it's I've been working in the last hour, my my office and my team and I have been working the last three months in building asset mapping comparative data across the city and looking at the deficits.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a list of those companies and nonprofits and organizations. We know exactly everything that Roxbury needs by now because we've been doing the study for the last four months, actually, before I even got inaugurated. But then there's the other thing that in 2022, Boston understands deficits and yet only provides to those who have access.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's odd. And so then the question is, it's like you slapping me twice. You know the problem. You don't fix the problem. But then when you fix the problem, you give the other side double the money of what you could give me or what you end up giving me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we are going to be looking at those things to see if any of what I'm saying makes sense. But I learned a lot from the presentation yesterday. Oh my God. Like you have the resources Boys and Girls Club does.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I connected to everything there. The three girls that were here, they were all West African, right? You pull them my heart strings. The Burtons, you had BPD. Like it was such a sorrow and such a influential presentation. How could I not?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was holistic. It was impressive. We want one of every BP's. We want BP to look like that. Right. So I agree with confusion. If we are to sit for forward, is this what we're doing? This is a new culture, y'all.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're setting precedents. This is what we're doing. What we can do is actually access money. This is what this government says. We can access money. And if you don't have access.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You, Counselor Laura, will.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Help us with technicalities. And if you don't know how to present counsel, Baker will help with that. And if you see disparity, counselor, me here will help you advocate. We have what it takes. We have the money and we have all of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yet I'm I'm I guess I'm just spilling over because I'm looking at all of the projects that's already proposed and I'm looking at what's happening. And now I'm learning little by little, all snap. I'm a rookie. I don't know, Jack.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why it's just bypassing me so fast. And meanwhile, people are, like, suffering, so I support you. It doesn't take away from your project or their project. It doesn't take away right it right wrongs wrong. If it's a good project, let's support it and let's keep it moving.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's do the same for other communities. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you. Council Fernandez Anderson for I call counsel Baker. I just wanted to weigh in. I had the opportunity to attend last night's meeting as well. And just listening to the young, young children there from from the McCormick School talk about how important this this facility would be to them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They don't they don't have money. They don't have any influence. A lot of them a lot of them actually live in public housing developments. But they're. I said that they should have a state of the art facility. That's as nice as any one in the city or nice as anyone in Lincoln of Wellesley.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those kids certainly deserve it. Council So I already mentioned that it's walking distance and as did Counsel Baker from the Mary Ellen McCormack Public Housing Development, which council counsel Baker represents. But it's probably the most difficult and challenging environment, living environment in the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, so I just want to say thank you to Counsel Baker for advocating hard for your constituents. And I appreciate that that type of level of advocacy that you've provided. Most of them. Most of them have kids, kids of color, kids in public housing developments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of a lot of African-American kids, black necks kids, a large, large Vietnamese population as well. And in Dorchester. So just want to recognize the live work counselor Counsel Baker did on that. Let me let me ask let me call on Counselor Baker.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, Counsel Baker, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to make a couple more points, and I apologize. So in 1974 for us here in Boston, on my side of the city, I was passed over to the devil to the devil school.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This parking lot looks exactly the same that I did in 1974. So for us to try and hold on to this, I think is a bit shortsighted. We should be shooting for more B.S. high across the street is is getting ready to spend $49 million on fields and field houses directly across the street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that means our kids in the Devil McCormac will be looking out over the fence saying, Look what's going on over there for them. BCI had one benefactor that gave them the $49 million. We're asking for ten to go towards this end.'",

Even folks who've had their families have owned a home in the neighborhoods. The next generation cannot see a future in which they will be homeowners in our city and in many of our immigrant'",

So one of the big issues that we're faced with, a lot of potential folks who want to buy a home are competing with investors'",
        "'speaker_7': 'who come into our neighborhoods with $1,000,000 in cash and put the money down before the house. Can even the two family home that come even come onto the market and then they rent out those homes, those two family and three family homes, $1,000 a bedroom, that's those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's generating $55,000 a month from a from a unit in a two family home. Working families can't afford that housing. Folks work together. Young professionals or students can group together and pay up. But this is a totally unsustainable way to go for housing going forward.'",

But I also think we need to really seriously look at the mechanisms to try and disincentivize this speculative investment that is driving families out'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And navigating the VA system was a bit traumatic considering all of the complications that I faced. But what I did not know was my rights and what I should be asking for and advocating on behalf of. And, you know, this conversation in terms of black maternal health is an issue of equity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think we have an opportunity here in the city of Boston to really lean into the conversation and help support the advocacy on behalf of this issue. We know that home births here in the city of Boston, not in the city of Boston, but just in general over the past years have risen dramatically.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The new Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports showing that between 2019 and 2020, home birth rates rose 47% in Massachusetts alone. Out of births, births either at home or in birth centers are safe and beneficial and a valid reproductive choice that is currently denied to most birthing people here in Massachusetts because of certified professional midwives who'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Passing this legislation is crucial for supporting birthing people, closing the crucial safety gaps and expanding access to out of hospital birthing options, meeting people where they are and accommodating the needs of birthing persons to ensure that they feel comfortable, safe and well taken care of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is crucial that we're making space for people with different preferences when it comes to birthing, and this legislation seeks to address just that. It also is very timely that this legislation is in the State House and we're currently celebrating Black Maternal Health Week in a time when historic and systemic inequities have resulted in the risk of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'death and severe mobility being two times as likely for black birthing women compared to white counterparts. And we need to be doing more to support this legislation to recognize black maternal health month. And I think it's all 365 days a year, especially as home birth rates have risen here by 36% among black birthing people in the United'",
        "'speaker_2': 'States and between 2019 and 2020. And for all those reasons, I'm excited to support this initiative and also just want to shout out this year to Brazil, who is leading now here in the city of Boston to have a birthing center right here in Boston.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I also want to give a shout out to Nurse Tiffany, the so who is in the labor and delivery, as well as Emily and Esther for all the work that they have been doing in this space. So just wanted to thank you both for your leadership and also to my co-sponsors for joining me on this.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, President Flynn. And thank you, Councilor, for including me as your co-sponsor on this resolution. I am very happy to hear the share of Ariel's name invoked in the City Hall chambers as the shearer was my boss, the Boston Public Health Commission, when I worked there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And she taught me pretty much everything I know about home birthing. And I think that the city of Boston is incredibly lucky to have her working to open the first freestanding birth center in the city and ran by a black woman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nevertheless, I'm excited that the Boston City Council has an opportunity to publicly support the out-of-hospital birth. Access its safety act and to recognize black maternal health week. This is an issue that is very near and dear to my heart as a mother.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When it came time to make a decision about my birthing plan, I was bombarded with research and data that made it very clear to me that the decision to have a child, especially as a black woman, was a dangerous one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The United States has the worst maternal health mortality among all wealthy nations in the world. And it's the only nation with a maternal mortality rate has been rising every year. In Massachusetts, like Councilor Richard Black, working people are two times more likely to die or have a near miss than their white counterparts due to structural or interpersonal'",
        "'speaker_2': 'racism. And I know that it's kind of daunting to listen to that data and to listen to those facts. But there's a bright spot. And that bright spot is that most maternal health deaths are preventable, which means that we can do something about this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I decided to have a homebirth to give birth at home, I did it because I knew it would be the safest, most affordable option for me. My midwives and my doula were essential in ensuring that I had a joyous birthing experience.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And our current laws in the state of Massachusetts make it so that experience is not accessible to everyone. I believe that all people deserve to have a birthday experience where they feel listened to, affirmed and cared for. And we should work to make that possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Regardless of whether people are giving birth at home at a birthing center or at a hospital and working towards this like CC will make that possible. By supporting this resolution, we're acknowledging that the importance of safer, more equitable access to midwifery care options and the impact that offering those supports will ultimately have on the maternal health outcomes'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you to Counselor Miki and Counselor Lara for sponsoring this and bringing this forward. And for all the advocates who've been doing work on this. When I did the racism as a public health crisis, I dug into a lot of different health metrics and things that impact health.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the most striking, disappointing and painful ones was the inequities that we see in black maternal health. Even in the Boston, where our hospitals are considered world renowned, we have these wide gaps and inequities in these unnecessary deaths.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And frankly, it's it's painful to know that our children and their parents are experiencing outcomes largely due to the fact that they are black. And so we need to get to a place where we prioritize this, where we speak on this, and we move on this in a way that effectively addresses a very real issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope to see real action on this because these numbers are scary. They are very disappointing. And we are in the year 2022 and this needs to be more of a focus issue. So thank you to those who have raised it.'",

And the number of stories from people in my own family, the number of time that I have had to exercise my'",
        "'speaker_2': 'strength as a lawyer to make sure that hospitals aren't discriminating against not only black women in the maternal health space, but in hospitals in general. So we have deep, deep health disparities where that we need to address. And there's so much work being done at the state level.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the state level, great advocates, which is why it's really important to help black women in spaces and legislative bodies really pushing for a black woman in our health. So just want to rise in support of this and rise in recognition of black maternal health.'",

And we had this discussion on the health care of African-American woman.'",
