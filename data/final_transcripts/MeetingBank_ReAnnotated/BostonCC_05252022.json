        "'speaker_6': 'Massachusetts citizens have a right to vote in all elections, even if deployed or stationed overseas. The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is a federal law that guarantees voting rights for the United States military, who are known as uniformed service voters.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'By the federal laws definition, eligible uniformed service voters strictly include those on active duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, including Reservists, Space Force, and the Merchant Marine members, as well as their spouses. Independents, more specifically, absent uniformed services voters are located outside of their voting districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In Massachusetts, absent uniform service voters are exempt from voter registration requirements, but instead must mail an absentee ballot application to their local election office in order to obtain their ballot for municipal elections. In Massachusetts, a blank ballot will only be delivered through the mail and must also be returned through the mail.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, for federal elections, a ballot can be emailed, faxed or mailed based on preference, and the voted ballot may be mailed back or electronically returned through email or fax. This is a more modern approach for absent uniformed services voters to participate in elections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mail in ballots have already caused problems in some elections nationwide. We know in Wisconsin, 9000 requested ballots were never sent and thousands were postmarked too late to count. In New Jersey, 9.6 of mail ballots cast in the state's local elections were rejected because signatures didn't match the ones on file or arrive too late.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in Pennsylvania, tens of thousands of votes were either not cast or not counted due to deadline. Confusion through this act's electronic application for an absentee ballot for municipal elections will streamlined the absentee ballot application process by eliminating the shipping time required to receive and deliver an application.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Also through this Act, electronically delivering and returning the ballots itself through email or fax will help better guarantee voting rights for absent uniformed services voters by streamlining the voting process, ensuring each ballot is counted in reducing the number of rejected ballots.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So in short, I urge my fellow colleagues in this body to support this special act so that we can better help guarantee voting rights for absent uniformed service voters in accordance with the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, as well as modernize the voting process in this bill, elections like they do in elections, federal elections.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'That ballot never reached me. And it could reach me about several months later after the voting. But for military people, it's not as simple as just just getting a piece of mail delivered to you, to your home, or to to your office.'",

The only thing this does is ensure that they're paying into Social Security, that they're paying into unemployment, that they're providing civil rights protections and sexual harassment protections, that they are treating their workers with respect and dignity that they deserve.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I'm in full throated support for this. It is incredibly important that we stand up for our workers, for folks who are holding it together during much of COVID. Folks were quarantined and ordering their groceries and ordering different things through these apps and relying, frankly, on workers who are putting themselves at risk for very little money'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and for very little respect from the organizations that they have made very wealthy. And it's important that we change that, that we make sure that that's not the case any longer here in Massachusetts. And so I thank counsel for her leadership here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think other council colleagues who have stood up on this and have been very loud on this. And I think counsel President Flynn for this moment to share my thoughts. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, counselor. L Would anyone like to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes counsel. BLOCK. Counsel, block. You have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. And thank you to Counselor Laura for leading on this. And Counselor Arroyo and I think many counselors are united on this front. It was moving to see so many folks, labor allies from across the state outside in front of the building earlier.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just really want to briefly emphasize that what Counselor Arroyo said about how there's nothing that prevents these big businesses from providing their workers with flexibility within existing Massachusetts labor law. Where they don't like about existing Massachusetts labor law is that we have some of the best protections for workers in the country, and they're trying to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'undermine those because they know that these are not outside contractors, that they're dictating far too much of people's workday for that to be the case. And they don't like the idea of having to fund all of those protections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I just want to emphasize, you know, I think, unfortunately, if if we allow this third category to be created in the name of flexibility, when in fact it's just letting people be workers without all of their workers rights, it's going to hugely hurt our rideshare drivers first.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then it's going to be a category that any number of workers in the Commonwealth could then become shunted into and lose a lot of their rights. So I think it's just a super, super important thing for worker power, for all of us to be pushing back on this and and making sure that Massachusetts voters know what'",
        "'speaker_6': 'it's really about. It's about the rich getting richer. It's about companies that have already basically set public transit and all kinds of other things in their sights and sort of like captured this big transportation market. And now they're trying to have as much of the profit from that as possible go their way and not to the workers'",
        "'speaker_6': 'who are, in fact, not even just the ones driving, but also the ones bringing the cars and paying the fuel and stuck in terrible leases for a lot of these cars. It's just it's a really exploitative industry. And this question would make it even more exploitative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's just something we can't allow. So thank you so much to my colleague and please. Hi, my name.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Counsel. BLOCK The chair recognizes Counselor Baker. Counselor Baker, you have the floor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Counselor, for putting this on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Putting this forth over and left.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not our first fight with them, and I don't think it will be our last state. They have been around for a little while and I was involved pretty heavily in with the taxi drivers. We totally crushed that industry there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that was mostly an immigrant driven.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, sort of good American story where you could get it, you could legitimately get a taxi.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And earn a living in that in that taxi or one or two of them. So we we lost that battle here. Now, they coming after Kensi was eloquent in what she talked about in in taking away the workers rights.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So let's keep an eye on them, because I think ultimately it's about it's about getting rid of those workers and replacing them all with automatic automated vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So but thank you for putting this forward and please. And thank you, Counselor Baker. Anyone else like to speak on this matter? The chair recognizes. And anyone else like to add their name. Mr. Clarke, please. I'd. Councilor Baker Council Bar Council President Council of Kolkata Council of Clarity Council, Media Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Murphy Council were all and pleased that the chair. Councilors Lara and Arroyo seek suspension of the rules and adoption of darkened 0486. All those in favor say aye. All right. All oppose. Say nay. The ayes have it. The resolution has been adopted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're onto personal orders. Mr. Clerk, please read docket 0687.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Duncan Smith 0687. Council of Flynn for Council.'"
