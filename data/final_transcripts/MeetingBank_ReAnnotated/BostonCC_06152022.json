        "'speaker_6': 'Boston For me, when we think about the word equity that we talk about a lot baked into, the very idea of equity is about the corrective action that we need to take for our policy harms and and the policy wrongs that we've done in the past.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When we look at the brilliance that that really culminated in decades, centuries long work on making the case for reparations in China. As Coates talks about the foundation of the wealth building in this country, in the foundation of capitalism, really being the slave trade, and that really serving as a model of wealth building and profit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And when we think about our city and the wealth of our city, which I talk about quite often, that wealth is really built on the back of blacks in the city and around the country. So we have a lot of work to do when it comes to acknowledging the harm and really repairing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it's one of the frustrations that I experience when we talk about equity because it is now the word du jour and baked into that word is corrective action. Baked into the word equity is an acknowledgment of our history and where we have gone wrong and what we need to do to make it all right.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But when we do that, we ignore the fact that we also played a very active role in the slave trade. I think about the Fugitive Slave Act and something that I have up in my office that I got from the Museum of African History about a decade ago is this advertisement that was put out by I think'",

        "'speaker_6': 'This was April 24th, 1851, when slavery was outlawed in 1783. And when we talk about evolution of discrimination and racism and bias, it's a continuum, right? These these these racist structures don't just disappear. They're really ingrained in a lot of the work that we have to undo here in city hall in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. And my last point will be also to something Councilperson Andre Anderson said. This is not about individual blame. When I went to college, I remember I met someone who a really good friend of mine who introduced me to this singer songwriter named Ben Folds, who has a song called Rock in the Suburbs.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in that song, he talks about coming up to a stoplight and he's a white guy and how a black man in a car next to him pulls up and looks at him and darts his eyes at him and this thing.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Never my idea. And this isn't about today whether or not slavery was an individual person's idea. Right? It's not about whether it was your idea. It's about acknowledging that profit, that wealth in this country, in this city, in Boston was able to tout this triple-A bond rating, these very strong fiscal resources that we have in this city'",
        "'speaker_6': '. But a lot of that is rooted in an unjust systems that really start where we start with indigenous folks who are coming here in the Mass Bay Colony, but it continued with slavery. And so we have a lot of work to do to atone for that, to repair the harm and to do the work together, to really'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be honest about our history, to do the work of repairing.

I don't have much more to say. We've heard from Councilor Fernandez Anderson about the importance of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We've gotten an incredible amount of historical context from Councilor Region. And so I think for for my remarks, I would just like to quote Alhaji Malik al-Shabab or Malcolm X as folks know him. Brother Malcolm said that if you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, that is not progress.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you pull the knife out completely, that is still not progress. That progress is ultimately healing the wound that was made by pulling putting the knife in my back in the first place. And to paraphrase. Not only have we not taken the knife out, we haven't even admitted that the knife is there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so some people will say that we have taken the knife out six inches. Some people might even argue that we've taken the knife out completely and that we are doing work to start healing that wound. And I'm not here today to argue the merit of either of those arguments, but this resolution is specifically about not skipping'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the critical step of admitting that the knife is there. And so my hope is that my council colleagues will vote in favor of passing this resolution today because we can't get to pulling it out six inches. We can't get to pulling it out completely.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Which they did. But they came back here and they they weren't treated with the respect and dignity that they've earned. So it's a somewhat it's a somewhat similar story, but I'm certainly supportive of this of this declaration because it's an important it's important matter.'",
