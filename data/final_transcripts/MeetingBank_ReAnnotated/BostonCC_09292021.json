Do you have the resources to enforce the new laws? And I think this is just a check in about that, especially as we're in the middle of a transition and we're dealing'",

So there's a lot of ways that the power imbalance of a landlord tenant relationship can affect the lives of the majority of Bostonians who do rent besides besides just rent.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'We have to push back a little bit on that. No city department wants to come down here and say they have all the necessary funds to do their job because that's not accurate. We need to be more aggressive as a body, myself included, in pushing back in and saying, No, you don't have enough money to do inspections'",
