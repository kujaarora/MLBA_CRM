        "'speaker_1': 'It was great to hear all the good news. I wish that all of 2014 will have such exciting and wonderful news as the council members have given us today. Okay, let's go on. Let's go to presentations. Madam Secretary, do we have any presentations?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And then Madam President, communications man. President We do have one proclamation this evening, and I will ask Councilman Herndon to please read it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Proclamation 2014 0007 Celebrating the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr visit to Denver's Park Hill neighborhood. Whereas, as a nation, we celebrate the American federal holiday marking the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr, which is observed on the third Monday of January each year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is a day to reflect on one person, one person's pivotal role in leading nonviolent activism for the civil rights movement beginning in the mid 1950s until his death on April 4th, 1968. And. WHEREAS, Martin Luther King Jr continues to be remembered for his work in ending the segregation of African American citizens in the South and the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'nation, as well as crafting the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and also receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 in Oslo, Norway. And. Whereas, Denver's Park Hill neighborhood also fondly remembers that 50 years ago this month, Martin Luther King Jr spent a historic three days visiting with various leaders in Denver'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and the metro area and delivering a powerful message of delivering powerful messages at two churches in Denver, Macedonia's Baptist Church, in my view, Boulevard Presbyterian Church, where more than 3000 people came to hear him talk of change and the future and its founding to all within its reach, that the problem of racial injustice is a national problem'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and not a sectional one. And we're. RATH Part of the impetus of Dr. King's visit to Park Hill was the neighborhood's position at the forefront of the national movement to integrate communities from housing to public schools. And. WHEREAS, Park Hill resident Dick Young, the 1964 chairman of the Denver Commission on Human Relations and sponsor of Dr. King's'",
        "'speaker_5': 'visit and his wife, Laurie, hosted Dr. King and shared his commitment to breaking down racial barriers in our great city and across the nation. And. Whereas, Denver churches and organizations are planning various events to mark the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Three day visit to Denver now therefore be proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver. Section one that the Denver City Council joins Park Hill residents as they celebrate this moment of history in Denver and to remember the work of Martin Luther King Jr that created change for all people.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Section two that the Denver City Council encourages residents of the city and county of Denver to remember the spirit of Martin Luther King Jr and the words he spoke to spur collaboration among all people stating that the ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at'",
        "'speaker_5': 'times of challenge and controversy. Section three that the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall testing affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that copies be transmitted to Dick and Laura Young, Rever Victor Lamont Lane, Macedonian Baptist Church and Reverend and Gregory Cummins, Mont View Boulevard Presbyterian Church.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon. Your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I move the proclamation 0007 2014 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's been moved and multiple seconded comments from council. I'll call on Councilman Herndon first.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Several things I want to put out. First, I want to give a thank you to care to get in the greater park Hill News. I was reading their their January issue when I learned about this video 50 years ago, which spurred the idea of having this proclamation so sincere thanks to them, as well'",
        "'speaker_5': 'as my other Park Hill Council members that I represent Park Hill as well, Councilmember Sussman and Brooke, we the three of us, sponsored this together, as well as other council members for supporting this. It's rare that you see a proclamation receive so much sponsorship from other council members.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I sincerely thank them for that. And there's really I can't think of a more fitting way as we start to honor the life and legacy of Dr. King, who was taken from us way too soon at the age of 39 with this proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just think about the life and legacy that he left. And because he was taken from us, he didn't have the opportunity to travel to as many communities and make the impact that he could have had. But Denver was one of them and Park Hill was one of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that is remarkable. And one of the reasons Park Hill was a was a location for him, because during that time, Park Hill was the only neighborhood in Denver, as the article talked about in one of the premieres In The Nation, to allow integration between minorities and whites because other communities white flight was happening as minorities were'",
        "'speaker_5': 'moving in and whites were leaving. And Park Hill was a neighborhood that fought against that to work integration together. And I think that is something that is remarkable and a testament to the great city and the great community that we have here in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm honored to represent that. And I also think to when you meet people and you have dialogs, people sometimes ask the question, if there's ever a celebrity alive or dead that you could meet, who would that be?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And a lot of times, Dr. King, is that answer. Well, for Dick and Laura Young, they don't have to say that because they had the honor of hosting them in their house. And I think that that is that is remarkable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm just in thinking about that. And that is living history. And so to you both, I say thank you for that as remarkable. And I just will I will stop there so that other colleagues can give their comments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon, Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Kathryn Hart. Herndon, for for ma'am. Bringing this to our attention, this is incredible. And now I know why District Gate is so great is because Martin Luther King came through and hung out with some of our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I'll just say this time of year is for me is always a special time when I get a chance to read through Dr. King's Testament of Hope, which is a collection of all of his his essays and all of his speeches.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's just an incredible opportunity for all of us to begin to consider the challenges. What are the societal challenges that we face, face today? And look look deep inside of ourselves, inside of this nation and in our country and in our city, and how we can be doing things better.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, you know, I hope we all pause this month and really challenge each of ourselves and us as a body and as a community to say what is the things that we can begin to grow in and we can begin to take risks on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so, you know, I think about Dr. King, I'm 34. And when he came on the scene, he was about 34, 35. And at that age he raised the social consciousness of the world really did. And so got a lot of work to do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay, we got to get. Got to get busy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. So thank you, Councilman Herndon. And I hope everybody will approve this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilwoman Robb. Thank you, Madam President. My husband and I moved to Denver in 1974, so maybe ten years after this. And one of the first places where we sat community was Mount View Boulevard Presbyterian Church, which has been a very important institution in the life in my life, in the life of my family'",
        "'speaker_1': '. But, you know, sometimes you just get lucky. It was amazing to stumble into a church that was at the forefront as Parkhill was. There was a whole coalition of churches that led this in Park Hill, and I am so proud, even though I've never lived in Park Hill, but to feel like I'm part of it through this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'institution and I'm so proud because it was an important part to Denver's future, I think. So while my colleagues certainly none of us will ever forget Martin Luther King, but I. I really wanted to give kudos to Park Hill, the leadership there at the time, and our city, for picking up on that leadership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Councilman Herndon, thank you very much for reminding us of our history. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to thank Councilman Herndon and Councilman Brooks and Councilman Susman for your sponsorship sponsorship, bringing this proclamation forward. You know, I, I, too, as a 36 year, I wish there were some people I could have seen in person.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I wish there were some speeches. I wish that I could have been at and I wish I was around in the sixties and seventies to be part of that part of those moments. But we shouldn't talk about Dr. King and other people like him who were revolutionaries, who were the real deal, who fought against serious social injustice'",
        "'speaker_3': ', and despite being threatened, despite paying the ultimate price, despite losing their jobs, despite being thrown in jail, as Dr. King in one of his speeches that said some of the things that we are going to be up against.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not civil rights and social justice isn't a thing of the past. This is today. And they fought not just for racial equality, but they fought for economic equality. They fought and they took to the streets. And they were faced with with fire hoses and dogs and and cruelty from a police baton and cruelty from the public'",
        "'speaker_3': 'because of those revolutionary ideas of equality. And I want to make sure that when we remember people like Dr. King, when we celebrate neighborhoods and people like that, or the allies that made these things possible and filled those marches with shoes and boots on the ground.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. That we embody that spirit every single day in whatever we do, whether you're a janitor, whether you're somebody that works for Parks and Rec or whether you're a council person or whether you're someone sitting in this very room, you know, supporting a cause that you believe in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do not talk about this as something of the past. It's a wall alive today. There are a lot of struggles that we're fighting today, and it's that spirit that we have to carry forward. And that's how we honor people like Dr. King and people like folks that, you know, we sang in our own chambers today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And even down downstairs when when our manager of safety was being sworn in, there were so many people in that room. And as people in this room, I know that have struggled for the same cause. So thank you, Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Thank you. Council on Assessment for bringing this proclamation forward. I'm glad to support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. I was alive during the sixties and seventies, sixties and seventies of the 1900s, not the 1800s. And I have to admit that I am very surprised that he was only 39 years old because he was, of course, an old soul.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And his impact was so great that we all would have been sure that he must have been with us much longer. And I am honored to be able to do this proclamation day. I thank Councilman Herndon for bringing it to us and thank Park Hill and the folks that we'll hear from soon for being there with him'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And thank Martin Luther King for what he did for our country. Madam Secretary, roll call herndon, i. I lost my place. You can eat. I Liman. Hi. Lopez. Hi, Monteiro. Nevitt. Hi, Ortega. Hi. Rob Shepherd. Brooks. High Ground.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Hi, Fats. I. Madam President, I. Madam Secretary, close the voting. Announce the results. 3913 eyes. The proclamation is adopted. Councilman Herndon, who would you like to call up to the podium?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I would like to call up Dick and Laura Young to the podium to accept this proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam President, my name's Dick Young, and in 1953, I've been appointed the chairman of the Denver Commission on Community Relations, and it was that organization that brought Martin Luther King for that weekend. Obviously, it was the most memorable weekend that our family ever had and ever will have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was fortunate that I was able to accompany him on most of the schedule. We had arranged it and it turned out extremely well. But I need to know others have expressed growing a lot of details as to what impact he had on the United States and on the world.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they're all true. But I want to spend just a minute thanking some people who are not here, but who had a major role. One is Helen Peterson. She was our executive director of the commission.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just did an outstanding job. And if all our public servants would be half as good as she was, would be so good. She was just so excellent. Manya Suey.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'On our commission. He served as my vice chairman and later he became a director of the commission. And I think there's a building named after him. He did tremendous work here. Bill Roberts, who was a member of the city council for many years and played a major role.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Roger Cisneros, who was very active and very much involved. Jim Reynolds, who ended up with the state heading the State Commission on Human Rights. Fred Thomas, another one, a park named after Fred. So really, we're here speaking, I think, on behalf of an awful lot of people who played major roles in making Park Hill and Denver what'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is today.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the reception, of course, was one of the highlights of our life to have him in our home to sign the Time magazine of where he was Man of the Year. And all I did, I think, was clean the house and make sure our four children did not stumble into him.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They all claim they sat on his lap, and I'm not sure that's true, but he did inspire us to go on even as Dick was working in fair housing. As you'll remember, the integration of our Denver public schools came later, and I had the opportunity to serve on the on the Community Education.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Council, which was appointed appointed by the court.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And all of our children have gotten a wonderful education in our beautiful area of Park Hill. So I thank you, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For for doing this for us.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you. It was lovely. Madam Secretary, I think it is time for us to read the resolutions from business, workforce and Sustainability 991 Resolution in the Mayor's Appointment of the Colfax Business Improvement District Board of Directors 994 a resolution approving the Mayor's reappointment, the Denver Convention Center Hotel Authority from Health'"

    "Cable Franchise Agreement Renewal with Comcast.": [
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I move the council bill series 2013 975 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. I actually need a second, second, second. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 975 is open where we have the staff report. Mr. Zaki.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Madam President. Members of City Council, Darren Zaki, general manager of Denver Media Services. This represents an incredible effort by the city and Comcast over a three year period to get this franchise. John, I am satisfied that this is an acceptable compromise document for Comcast cable service for the next ten years, given that this is a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'deregulatory environment now where local franchising authorities no longer have the power that they used to. Even as recently as 1999, when we last negotiated this franchise, I would like to take a moment of personal privilege to thank the council members who were involved in the Franchise Renewal Group, Council President Susman, Council members Rob Ortega and Council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And of course also to David Broadwell, the assistant city attorney, to providing guidance and questions and directions that without that, this whole process would not be possible. So my personal thanks to all of you for this. A reminder as well to this is a nonexclusive franchise agreement, which sometimes is a point that is forgotten.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nothing in the Comcast franchise prevents the city from granting other franchises from other companies that are qualified to do this. So this is not a monopolistic document in its in itself. I would like to take just a couple of minutes to identify the high level provisions in that the franchise document is on our website on Denver gov'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for public consumption too. But I'll hit the high level ones primarily. We were looking at maintaining the services that we had under the existing franchise. I know it's not necessarily the best place to start, but with deregulation of the cable environment, that's where we really had to look at.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most importantly, I think is the maintenance and actually an improved language about rights of way compliance. Under the old franchise, Comcast had a set language of what they had to comply with. It was kind of a snapshot. So a city code change franchise quickly became out of date.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now the franchise points directly to Denver City Code for Rights of Way. So whenever the city chooses to change that, Comcast still has to stay in compliance to protect the public rights of way themselves. GROSS revenues definitions were maintained in a very broad definition.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why that is important is because the franchise fees, the compensation the city gets for the use of the public right of way for Comcast service is something that across the nation is becoming more and more narrow. The city was able to maintain the broader definition of that so that the revenues coming into the city will maintain a'",
        "'speaker_3': 'good level. And by way of example, in 2013, we're estimating that the fourth quarter payment still is due, should be approximately 6.3 to $6.4 million that comes into the general fund. Next is that was the city's big issue on Comcast side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The big issue was something called competitive equity. This is not something that was in the existing franchise. In short, it says that if city if and when the city does negotiate another franchise with another company, it can't cannot be competitively advantageous to that other company.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it if the cable company feels that it is, it has to demonstrate to the city why it is noncompetitive from Comcast standpoint. Then there can be negotiations and either the Comcast franchise will meet that language or their franchise goes directly into negotiations against it shortens the term on that auditing requirements and letter of credit requirements are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the strongest now in the metro area, if not the entire state of Colorado. So that was something that actually Denver was able to maintain that I'm very proud of, too. It helps us protect residents needs if there are violations or underpayments from Comcast on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The last point that I'll bring up on that is regarding public education and government access channels of which Denver it is. One city will be getting three high definition channels. There will also be a video on demand presence or a presence of some of our videos on Comcast video on demand platform.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the ordinances tonight is that the franchise would allow for an increase in the peg fee to pay for all the equipment, the lights and the cameras and the microphones and so forth. For all of these entities, which is the city of Denver, it is Denver Public Schools and Denver Open Media.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Last thing I want to bring up, just as a general thing before we get to the rest of the people, too, is where it gets frustrating for residents and for the city, too, is this document can only address cable television service.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Unfortunately, it cannot address Internet service or telephone service provided by Comcast. Those are either non-regulated services or they. Are regulated by another level. So this is where it'd be nice if federal law could catch up to where we are in current 21st century technology so that these companies that provide multiple services, at least federal law, does address'",
        "'speaker_3': 'them. So unfortunately, the city and this document cannot address great regulation. It cannot address equipment fees. It cannot address if there are problems with those services. Comcast, through its escalations department, has cooperated with the city on multiple occasions, with the city, contacts them, even though it's a service that the city does not have jurisdiction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Comcast does engage the customer and try to reach resolution. So for that, they do deserve credit, even though, you know, they could tell the city that this isn't something that is in our purview. So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions that council may have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much, Mr. Zaki. We have four speakers signed up and I'd like to ask all four to come to the front pew since there are four while the first speaker comes to the podium. And that is Jeff Dolan, Thad, Texar, Jeffrey Washington and Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So, Mr. Dolan, you're up first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, members of the City Council, it's a sincere pleasure for me to be here tonight, along with my colleague John Lehman, who helped negotiate this franchise with the city of Denver. You know, tonight is really the culmination of nearly three years, as Darren said, of franchise renewal negotiations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that one of those things I never thought I'd get enough of. Until I until I got enough of it. So tonight, we're going to stick around through the public comments and answer any questions you might have later.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I did want to make just a few brief comments. So first of all, I'm deeply appreciative of the, you know, all the members of the city council for their leadership on this matter. You know, we're particularly thankful to the members of the franchise renewal group who provided so, so much guidance over the last couple of years'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to the city staff. And certainly we're appreciative to the city staff for their countless hours of work and focus on bringing this renewal to a successful conclusion. It has been a long process and I want to personally recognize and thank with with heartfelt thanks Darren Zaki for for his tireless efforts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'David Broadwell who was at every one of those negotiation meetings over the last couple of years and Sky Stewart who over the last several months helped bring this too to the goal line here. So really appreciate the efforts of staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, we, you know, having worked in government, I know they've got so many competing demands on their time. But even in the most intense of negotiation meetings, of which we had many over the last several years, they were always true professionals and really great representatives of the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So our thanks go out to them. And, you know, the staff drove a hard but fair bargain. And I think Darren laid it out pretty nicely and laid out the pros and cons pretty nicely there. The new franchise really is a balanced and modernized agreement, taking into account, you know, sort of the modern technology that we have'",
        "'speaker_3': 'here and the competitive marketplace that we operate in. So the franchise, as Darren pointed out, provides the city with significant revenues over the ten year term. There's major enhancements to the Access Channel platform, and there's really important consumer protection provisions that will make sure that you all hold us accountable over these next ten years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think the franchise also reflects the dynamic and competitive communications marketplace that Comcast operates in every day with with every line of business that we're in. And the franchise gives us the certainty and the flexibility that we need to continue making the massive investment in our business that we need to do to stay competitive so that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'we can continue to innovate and offer more advanced products and an improved customer service. We recognize that we've got to get better at providing customer service to our constituents, and we're trying to do that every single day. So and we've gotten a lot of feedback and counsel from you all along the way, so we appreciate that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But, you know, most importantly, what we want to do is, you know, under this new franchise, we want to grow our business in Denver. We want to grow our presence in the community. And we look forward to working with you all to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, I think to close the negotiation process really was, you know, just truly a collaborative process with the city. It creates the foundation with this new franchise for an even stronger partnership.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your time is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Up. Okay. All right. Well, I just want to close with, you know, say thank you again for all the time and effort that the staff put into this and appreciate your time tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you, Mr. Dolan. Thad, Texar.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thad, Texas 4535 Julian Street. I have no doubt that Comcast deserves a 5% customer increase in fees. Once again, though, council has found a more important use for money than meeting its commitment to the homeless. The problem is that nobody in the city is more deserving of our money than our homeless fellow citizens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And unlike the homeless, nobody at Comcast will freeze to death on our streets, in our alleys, or along our rivers if this increase isn't approved. You know, I never had the privilege of walking with Dr. King, but on several occasions I did have the privilege of walking behind him.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A lot of us were behind him in both literally and figuratively. And, you know, I know that on this issue of homelessness and dedicating revenue for the homeless, where Dr. King would have stood and he would have been way ahead of me on this one, too, and he would have said, don't honor me with a resolution.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Honor me by dedicating money to the citizens among you that need it the most. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Mr. Text, sir Jeffrey Washington.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Jeffrey Washington. I live in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I opposed this. I mean, why do we need this and why is it for so long? I mean, we.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We live in a country.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Where the free market is promoted.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is absolutely against every principle of the free market. I mean.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I understand you say Comcast is the only cable provider we have in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to grant them a franchise for ten years, I mean, death, to absolutely discredit any other company, maybe for wanting to come, come in and provide the service for one is too long. And I read in the some of the language of the proposal, if you're providing free cable to public schools and private schools and charter schools'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Well, what if our home school, my children. Why can't I get free cable? I mean. I mean, why not?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, I'm. I'm home schooling my my children at home. Why can't I get free cable to provide.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Educational access for them? I just think this is a bad idea. If anything, the the term of the contract needs to be shortened because this is wrong.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Washington. Sekou.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Matt. My name is Chairman Sekou of Organize and founder of the Black Star Action Movement advocacy group for poor, working, poor and homeless people. We support this agreement. It is not a perfect agreement and there are some areas that we are diametrically opposed to, especially when it comes to the utilization of us negotiating with items such as'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the Internet and phone service, because these are big ticket items, especially for poor, working, poor and homeless people. But we acknowledge the work that has been done by city council and that is not to be discounted or marginalized or minimized because the work that has to be done just to kind of pull all of this kind of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'stuff together. Now, one of the things is real clear to me is that the key to this agreement is going to be on enforcement. And we're going to have to monitor this thing with vigilance so that things don't fall through the cracks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in the process, as things are evolving and we have the option to bring other companies in that are smaller. We must give that the same attention as we do the big folks, the big guys, the big corporations.'",

And if you don't, you can be guaranteed back in the spirit of Martin Luther King. The people are watching you and they're watching what you do more so than what you say.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in this body, we've come to learn that this is all about the power of the pen. But this agreement means nothing if it's not enforced. And so we have the moral obligation to make sure that it does what it says and makes sure the council that is given all of the support he needs to make sure'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that he takes them to the test, taking it to court and making sure the city is victorious. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Mr. Sekou. That's the end of our speakers. So let's open the floor for questions from council. Councilwoman Shephard. Thank you, Madam Chair, that Mr. Washington made a good point. Typically, if one wants to access a public access channel, one has to have a subscription to such that you usually get in your home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm just wondering if Jeff or John out there could talk to how the public may access educational programing, for example, if one doesn't have a subscription.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks, Councilwoman Sheperd. So there's a few things that we would do in that situation. You know, one of our really important community initiatives is a low cost broadband program called Internet Essential that provides broadband service for low income families for $9.99 a month.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's a program that a lot of you have been really helpful in getting the word out in the community. And this is a great forum to talk about it as well. To all of viewers at home and to the folks here in the building, you know, that's something, you know, if somebody would qualify, if they're on the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'free or reduced lunch program, they can contact us and apply for that program. And and that the power of the Internet and all the educational tools that come along with it. We'd love to sign them up for that program in terms of, you know, offering free cable service to the home school entities.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It you know, that's administratively that's been a nut that we haven't been able to crack. We do offer free cable to public schools and charter schools, but just the number of home schooled folks, you know, administratively, it's really difficult for us to try to track.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We haven't been able to do that yet, but we would encourage lower income folks to explore the Internet Essentials program to get the power and everything that the Internet brings in terms of educational tools into the home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. I have a question about the location of the Comcast customer service site. I continue to hear complaints that people are not able to take their parks and other equipment back to the to the Comcast Location Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I wanted to ask you, what are your plans in terms of opening the center in Denver and what you're doing in the meantime? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks for the question, Councilman Monteiro. So we did close the the old customer payment center that was over on Acoma back in March. It was, you know, it's a pretty industrial area. We didn't have large volumes of traffic there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's not the most desirable location for folks in terms of a retail experience. So, you know, we closed in March. We are actively looking for a new location for a cable store here in Denver. The City Department of Economic Development has been helpful in trying to find desirable sites that would work for our business for that'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so we've continue to work with them. We are actively looking at some other sites. Some of the members of the council have referred locations to us as well. So we're exploring those. We do intend to open a new cable store in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We recognize it's you know, it's the largest city in the state. And we'd be remiss to not have a retail location there. But we do want a retail location that is in a, you know, high traffic, high volume area that has, you know, good retail partners.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that is not a, you know, in sort of an industrial area that is a is a difficult place for folks to go, especially if they're taking public transportation. So we're looking for the appropriate site. And I'd say for folks who, you know, want to send us equipment, we do have a program where we will send them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'a self paid mailer envelope to their home so that they can easily and efficiently send us back equipment. So that's a program that we've got going on right now here in Denver. So that's one way we're trying to take care of those folks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But there's also, you know, we have launched a huge variety of self-help tools online. So there's really there's there's nothing that a customer can't do in terms of interacting with us online. I mean, there's there's a host of different things, different online tools and self-help tools and mobile apps and things like that that allow people to very'",
        "'speaker_3': 'easily and efficiently interact with us, whether they're trying to pay a bill or return equipment or, you know, look at their bill statement. There's there's a lot of online tools that are really, really helpful. So and we're seeing the usage of those online tools go way, way up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Madam Chair, when we're clear, go right in. What about people with disabilities? Will Comcast come in, pick up the equipment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We will. And in fact, I think that's an explicit obligation in our and either the franchise or the customer service standards that she'll be voting on tonight as well, that if a customer has disabilities and special needs, we will go to their home, pick up that equipment and no cost to them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And is there a customer service number that you can share?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One 800 Comcast. That's an easy one, right? Thank you. You bet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I have a couple of questions. And the first one I think should either be Darren or maybe Jeff, to answer this question, can you highlight what the changes are in the customer service standards from what has existed in the current franchise that we're operating under today?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Councilwoman Darren Zaki, Denver Media Services. The customer service standards that you will be voting on tonight, Ashleigh, are updates. To tell you the truth, a lot of that is is very similar in terms of how quick Comcast has to set an appointment for new service, you know, how it treats the yard and so forth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The things that are different actually have to do with data about the customer. There are a lot more customer protections, such as, you know, if Comcast collects some data for people, how quickly they have to use it and destroyed it cannot be used for any purposes other than their own.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then how quickly they have how quickly excuse me, how much they what measures they do to protect that data. And then again, as I said, how to destroy that. Those are the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sites data in terms of usually like a company will give you a two hour window or something like that. If you're scheduling an appointment, can you just speak to whether there were changes to that aspect?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If there were not changes, there's still a four hour window unless the cable company and the subscriber agree to a different time. Generally, they're between the hours of, I believe it's 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., unless again, there are agreements to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So a lot of those provisions are the same, but it's it's meant to. And that seven days a week, it also talks about even though we don't have a payment center here in Denver, it does talk about what hours of payment centers are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most of that is the same provisions of what currently are in Denver's customer service standards. I think we had a pretty good jump on that when we first implemented these back in, I believe was 1998.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I have a different question for you, Darren. Somebody from the audience asked about the revenue that we get from the franchise agreement, and the suggestion was we should be spending it on the homeless. Can you talk about what kind of restrictions or provisions there are for how the money that we receive from the franchise agreement is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'generally spent?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly. And I'll go ahead and differentiate between the franchise fees and the PEG fees. So franchise fees, again, are those 5% of gross revenues the city gets, in essence as rent for Comcast, using the rights of way that money goes directly into the general fund and there are no limitations of its use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is up to city council and the mayor's office and budget officer to determine how that money is. But in essence, it's hard to track it. It just goes into one big pool peg. Fee revenue, which is collected separately, can only be used for capital construction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It cannot be used for operations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the next question is going to be a little harder. So I want you to take out your crystal ball or look into the future and give us sort of your projection. And, you know, maybe you guys from Comcast can help.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The industry is changing. We wouldn't have thought, you know, 25 years ago that we'd be using the Internet the way we're doing. Lots of things have changed. And do we have any anticipation that cable TV is not going to have the same dominance that it has had in the industry, if you will, in the way that it's'",
        "'speaker_6': 'utilized today by many people?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will go ahead and let Jeff talk about that portion of that. I think from a city standpoint, there's going to be increased diversification. I mean, that's why I think you've seen Comcast purchase Universal and NBC, not to put words in Comcast's mouth, but I think from the regulatory standpoint is definitely going to be a challenge for'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cities to protect our authority in the public rights of way. I think you're exactly correct, Councilwoman, that in fact, just today I was reading about two congressmen who are planning to file bills to update the Communications Act of 1934, which covers all of this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To tell you the truth, I don't think anyone will disagree. Communications Act does need to be updated. It was last changed in 1996, does not even reference the Internet. So clearly there's a lot. And obviously companies like Comcast are providing multiple services.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think the challenge for the city over the next even 5 to 10 years will be to make sure that there's not deregulation to the point that it also includes our local authority to control the public right away.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'By federal law, it's usually the local government that has that authority to make sure that we can protect that investment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's why it's important that we pay attention to any of that federal legislation that moves through and weigh in on it as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Jeff, do you want an answer? My question is what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I'd be happy to answer. To answer that question. Councilman Ortega, thanks for the question. It's a great one. And it's one that, you know, obviously my company thinks a lot about in terms of, you know, the future of TV and where's it going.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think an important piece of this franchise agreement that we negotiated with the city is it does allow Comcast the flexibility to innovate and to continue to invest in our products and services here in Denver. It's not overly, you know, prescriptive in that sense.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I think that was a strong signal of the kind of partnership that that was important to Comcast, the partnership with the city to, you know, really, this is the kind of city that we want to invest more in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But I think in terms of, you know, the relevance of KKTV down the road, I mean, one thing that we've been putting an enormous amount of resources and and time into is making sure that we're making TV and, you know, are cable services as relevant to people as possible?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a piece of that is making sure that that our customers, your constituents can watch content and programing on any device that they have whenever they want to watch it, wherever they may be. So with, you know, just in the last year, we've had sort of these, you know, really revolutionary developments in terms of our of our'",
        "'speaker_3': 'cable architecture and allowing our customers to, you know, if if there are a customer, you know, a, you know, a digital customer at their home, you know, that they can watch that content that they're paying for, you know, on their iPhone or iPad or their Droid device.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And whether they're, you know, somewhere, you know, you know, commuting within the city or in the Caribbean or wherever they may be, they're able to get the content that they're subscribing to on that device that that that mobile device.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's one piece of, you know, what we're trying to do to make content more relevant and to make sure that we stay futureproof and stay ahead of some of these trends.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So try that the next time I go to Aruba or someplace to make sure I get it. Just kidding. Thank you very much for answering my questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Robb, you, Madam President, Councilwoman Ortega, ask one question that I had about the pig fee that Mr. Tasca said was going up 5%. But the implication, I thought, in his testimony was that it was going back to Comcast, but it does go to DPS to Channel eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The Denver Open media, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, you're correct. Actually, how it works is Comcast collects that and then distributed to my agency with the city. Then we distribute it to those entities. Correct? Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And then there was another question on how are we going to enforce the franchise? We talked a little bit about customer service standards, but there are other enforcement things. Can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly myself and my staff are the enforcers of that. We're the administrators of the contract once it is put in place. So in that we conduct a yearly franchise fee and peg fee audits mean and we're making sure that that Comcast calculates all of that correctly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We get we will be requiring quarterly reports from Comcast on a variety of issues such as telephone response, time sensitive number of complaints, types of complaints, so forth. We monitor all of that against the franchise, document itself to make sure we question things when things don't make sense.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We do also take some guidance for customers calling in or contacting our agency as well to to follow up on all of that. So I think it's a, you know, a pretty good way to come about. I mean, it's literally it's monthly that we're looking at some reports quarterly on some of the other reports that I mentioned'",
        "'speaker_1': '. And are there damages due from Comcast if they do violate some parts of these, how does that work?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are exactly there is a fairly extensive section of this franchise having to do with franchise violations. Exactly correct. That is it's a actually it's extremely process from what it used to be, but it's still a has several steps in that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But to answer your question, Shirley, if the city were to get to the point and actually council serves as the local franchising authority in that situation finds that Comcast is in default or in violation. City does have the right to penalize Comcast up to $500 a day per incident.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And in the last question, also, based on the testimony about the free market, and I think you addressed it in your opening comments, other providers are allowed to come in and request the same sort of franchise from the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is correct. Right. Actually, we could have overlapping franchises. This is not a just one time type of thing. This franchise would go into effect in 2014. For ten years, company ABC could come along in two years and they could have a ten year franchise.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is totally. We separate from this. So there can be however many franchises of companies that wish to provide those services. Yeah, you're correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have had that in the past and we could in the future, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We could. Correct. We had a small company in the past and I actually remain optimistic that hopefully something might happen in the next five years or so with another company. With another company. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. All right. That just sort of addresses some of the testimony. Thank you. Thank you. I have one question, actually. It was a well, I haven't been to the meetings. We aren't actually allowed to deny the franchise, are we?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The city can deny, but only under very specific reasons as a set by federal law. So it's not a matter of whether we just don't want to. Right. The only way that the city can deny a franchise renewal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Renewal is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If the city can prove that a company does not have the legal, technical or financial capability to operate a cable system. So its federal law is written to make it very difficult not to renew a franchise.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's what I recall. Thank you very much. And I don't see any other questions when we look up and down here. So I'm going to close the public hearing and ask for comments from council. Councilwoman Lehman, would you like to make that comment first and then I'll call on you, Councilwoman Fat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, I will be abstaining from this voting on this issue because my son works for Comcast.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Lehman. Councilwoman Fox.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would like to address two different areas here. One, the customer service centers with the Acoma Street Center closing. There was some confusion in my area as to where the closest center was, and I just had an experience this past week where I found out personally where it was for the west side of town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It really is not that inconvenient. It's in Belmar. It's in the same complex as Whole Foods. That wasn't even when I got there. I thought, Oh, now, exactly where is it? It's right there on the corner of Alaska, right there in the Whole Foods complex.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So just know there's plenty of parking around it. It's working well for our area. Thank you. As far as the ordinance is concerned, once again, I will be abstaining. Part of the issue that I am concerned about was the issue that President Sassaman raised right at the end about whether we can deny a franchise renewal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I still remain concerned about the fact that language is in our charter that requires a franchise to be put to a public vote. I would feel far better if that language were removed by the voters from our charter, and that's what I had hoped would happen this last election.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They never referred it to the voters, and I still feel uncomfortable saying yes to a renewal when that language remains in the charter. So I will be abstaining as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Fox, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I didn't really have any issues with this actual agreement this time around, but I do I do just want to emphasize the access issue. And although I do agree with my colleague, Councilman Fox, those of us on the west side, we just have to, you know, go down Alameda.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we go down in the wrong direction, guys. We have to go down this way into denver territory. This is the denver city council. This is our agreement with you all. These are jobs that we can have in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, since I was a kid, we always used to go west of Alameda to do our business and find. And we should be going east of Alameda. I mean, I'm not east of AMI, east of Share, not west of Sheridan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And although I love my friends in Lakewood, Commerce, Councilman, Rival and all those folks over there, Mayor Murphy, they're great people. But I think that, you know, if we're making an agreement with Comcast in Denver. We can create jobs in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's do that in Denver and let's make sure that our customers in Denver have that access. And let's make sure there's more than just one rep at the window. Those things are heavy. After a while, you're carrying that box.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Anyway, thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just want to take a moment to thank folks who were involved in this process as well. It took almost a year, a little longer than a year to go through through the well, I guess this last round that we sat through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what I was referring to. But I know it's something that's been in the discussion stages for some time. So I want to thank David Broadwell and Skye Stewart as well as Darren Sulky and. Folks from Comcast for the many, many meetings that it took.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And my two colleagues, Ginny Fox and Ginny Raab, who sat on the committee and walk through provision after provision, as you all would have the meetings with with Comcast to talk about the areas of contention or where the changes were being made.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think in the end, this is a good product for the citizens of the city of Denver. I know Denver tried to hold firm on not giving up things that were in the current franchise unless we were getting something else in place of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think the negotiating team did a really good job. So I just want to encourage my colleagues to move this forward tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. And I see no other comments. I think it's time for a roll call. Madam Secretary Ford's.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'All you have in front of you is the old code to look at, to understand what you need to do. And it never really speaks to the fact that there are zone districts nearby that should be protected because you, as you see, for example, didn't exist under the old code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You'll never find it there. So our question is circled in the bottom there is how do we get development in that arm? You 22 recognize that there are zone districts nearby that need to be protected. So that's what we're trying to do with this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Before I get into the details, just where does this arise? Is it a problem? Is it citywide? We stumbled upon this in doing plan review for certain projects in Northwest Denver. First, that this this issue arises with mapping all the new code lands next to each other.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What this map shows is wherever you see red, the yellow immediately next to it should be protected. And the read is old code zone properties that used to be controlled and we never had an issue when we were just operating under one code.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But now that we have two codes, we want to make sure the yellow, which is new code residential zone districts are protected next to the old code red. So you can see it's throughout the city and pockets. And so this is something that we definitely want to address through this amendment because it does raise issues in every'",
        "'speaker_6': 'council district. So what are the types of protections we're looking to assure continue? Again, these are nothing new. These protections have always existed. We just have to make that link between the two codes. For example, building height, limit symbol controls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have a maximum 75 feet of height for buildings when they're located 150 feet within a protected district. We have increased setbacks in some instances where there's development in a mixed use zone district next to a residential or single unit or two unit zone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have lots of limitations in the code, not much, but a good handful on specific uses when those uses are established in close proximity, proximity or next door to a residential zone. Some examples are given on the screen, such as limits on drive thru facilities operating hours into the evening when those facilities are located right next to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'residential zones. So to the point, this text amendment is to section 59 to 2 of the Denver Revised Municipal Code. Your screenshot there shows where and then in the muni code library this section is found. This is not an amendment to either of our two zoning codes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's to the rules in the one place where we talk about how the two codes should relate to each other. Again, this is adding new subsections. You have your ordinance draft in your package. The next two slides simply summarize and verbatim shows those new subsections.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You have review criteria for justifying a change like this that this is found in the City Charter for adoption of new zoning related ordinance that are not part of the zoning code. Your three criteria are you need to find that the change is consistent with the city's adopted comprehensive plan, that it furthers public health, safety and general'",
        "'speaker_6': 'welfare and results in uniformity of regulations. Very quickly, as detailed in the staff report, staff has found that the amendment is consistent with the plans. We need to assure that our zoning code remains flexible and accommodates a variety of land uses, also encourages that quality infill development while respecting existing character and intensity of development nearby.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This does just continue the status quo of what we all thought we were doing when we kept two zoning codes in place, which is to keep the restrictions on former Chapter 59 lands the same so that this amendment will assure that we don't unintentionally provide some loopholes that we didn't think were there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It does further the public general welfare by assuring the continuation of those protections and will result in uniformity of zone district regulations regardless of what zoning code you're operating under with that CPD staff, which who initiated this amendment recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Gina. We have two speakers signed up, Joel Noble and Keith Pryor. I'd like to call Joel Noble to this podium.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Before I begin, I think Keith Pryor meant to sign up for the rezoning on 3099 Arapahoe and got the wrong number.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Madam Secretary, does he need to sign up? I can change his card. All right. Thank you very much. Go ahead, Mr. Noble. Thank you for letting us know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm Joel Noble, 2705 Stout Street, president of Curtis Park Neighbors. In your staff report, you have a letter from Curtis Park neighbors supporting this. This is very technical, but it's very important. Right now, we have loopholes, as Tina Axelrod said, that someone who has properties zoned to the old zoning code where the old zoning code says you'",
        "'speaker_3': 'can't do certain things when you're adjacent to a residential district, can look next door at a residential district. But the residential districts in the new zoning code and see what residential district that one doesn't count. And it could drive drive a truck right through that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's interesting that this oversight didn't get noticed for a few years until the upturn in the market and development started. And our our friends in Jefferson Park ran into it with someone who saw that loophole with regard to protected districts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Staff was very quick to say, you know, we have a loophole here. We should fix it to propose that. And I just want to communicate to council what a delight it is to work with staff. Because when I decided to be, you know, a little detail oriented and say, you know, okay, I'm going to look through the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'code and find some other things that might be there that we should do. At the same time, staff said, Great, you know, rather than saying, no, we're the experts, you know, leave it, leave it to us. They said, That's great.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's see if we can find even more. And they did. They found the biggest one, which is the residential, all the different ways that residential zoning districts are called out in the old code that, of course, don't refer to the new code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I felt this has been a little bit of a collaboration and I appreciate the ability to go to planning board meetings and go to hearings and and fix this so it works the way we intended. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Noble. And thank you for your wonderful volunteering effort efforts. That is, it concludes our speakers call on council for questions. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have a question about how this proposed change would impact the use of regulating plans. And is that a tool that the Zoning and Planning Office is still using of financing the zone changes? To answer your first question, since we didn't have a regulating plan in the old code, this amendment doesn't speak to regulating plans at all'",
        "'speaker_6': ', and there's no effect on their use, voluntary or mandatory in the new code. Okay. So is that a tool that the department is using with the new code? Yes. Okay. I just have not seen any come through recently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Do we have any expected to be coming through with. They do not go to city council for final action. It's after zoning entitlement is in place. So it's all administrative when we do use them. Well, I know in some of the zoning that we've had there referred to.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Thank you for. And I continue to be concerned that there really is no tool to ensure that the things that are in the regulating plan, in fact, can be enforced. Because if somebody can get zoning approval. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Contingent on a regulating plan being worked out with the neighborhood, and they turn around and sell the land to somebody else who wasn't party to that agreement. That next person developing that project does not have to adhere to that regulating plan because there's nothing any place that really holds either the city's feet to the fire or the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'landowners feet to the fire to ensure those things get done. And I think when we talk about loopholes, that's one that I know neighborhoods have expressed as a big concern to us, even though it's not directly on point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I can respond to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was going to say, was there a question in that Councilwoman Ortega's question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Was if regulating plans were being utilized, and I was just expressing my concern about them. So.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Does it sound like there's a question? Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thanks. I have no further questions or comments.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Councilwoman. Councilman Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'm a little reluctant to ask detailed questions because I didn't go to committee when this was presented. But I think I have a question that can be fairly simply answered. So the the the old code made accommodations for protected districts but was blind to the protected districts in the new code.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And presumably it goes the other way around that the new code obviously makes accommodations for protected districts but didn't recognize the protect protected districts in the old code. They pretended they didn't exist.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually, we caught it going in that direction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So the new code recognizes the protected district and the old code is just the old code, not protecting, not accommodating the protected districts in the new code. So now that they do lose protections. TRUMP So do they behave?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There's no trumping because you're either under one code or the other. There's no conflict there. If you're in my diagram, the old code arm 20, you only look at the old code, plus this DMC 59, dash two for your rules.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got it. So if you are under the old code and you're now the scales have fallen from your eyes and you're now recognizing the protected district next door, you protect it with the regulations written in the old code, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not the regulations written in the new code. Correct. Got it. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Nevett. Councilwoman Robb. Okay. I was wasn't committee in that series of questions just sort of got me. So how does someone figure out there? They're an army of 20. Under the old code. How do they know to look at section 59, dash two?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, that's a bit of a challenge, certainly, but they're still rules. And in the DRC that apply to lands retaining all code that leads you to know what you need to do. When you look on the Sony map and CRM, U20.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It tells you, first of all, that the firm form of Chapter 59 code was kind of placed in amber and frozen in time on June 25th, 2010. And those are your rules. That's what it says, first off. And then it's then it goes into more detail.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've just added a few more things they need to look at. So there is you know, we we do rely on staff.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And our our best.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Public outreach in terms of our website on what what your zoning and what you need to look at. This amendment has been, you know, quite, quite a bit discussed and heads up across CPD. And I'm working with the zoning administrator to assure that if this gets adopted, it will go into effect this week and we will immediately'",
        "'speaker_6': 'send out a copy of the ordinance to all reviewers and all CPD. So they have already been prepared. I've met with every single review group who does development review, residential and nonresidential, and so they know this is coming possibly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're going to do our best to assure that at the front counter and in development review. At the very least, we we know what the rules are and that we're able to point people, you know, as much ahead of time during concept and pre-op meetings to these provisions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, the good news is that I and C is aware of it for alerted neighborhoods. And it's important that our officers. Yes. Be aware enough. So if someone comes in initially, we can say you better check it.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I didn't know if you had a comment or not. It's just this is a needed change. I support it. Okay. Very well done. Councilman Shepherd. A woman Shepherd. Madam President. So, District one was the guinea pig for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See, in the old code versus the new code and how they interact together. And I do really think CPD for quickly identifying the fact that, you know, this cannot continue and for taking the initiative to bring it forward as a, as a standalone amendment and bring it forward in front of the omnibus text, amend text amendments that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'we'll be considering here in the next few months. You know, it's been a few months since this happened in my district, but, you know, essentially the conflict was around bulk plans for a developer who wanted to develop under old code but was right next to protected zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm not going to go into any more details because I'm not sure if I'm even clear at this point what unfolded there. But quite frankly, it was a big mess and there were appeals to the Board of adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, there was a lot of anger on the part of the neighborhood for us not having noticed this. There was multiple rounds of mediation with the developer. Of course, the developer didn't want to sort of go with the intent of things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It was a big, hairy mess, quite frankly. And a lot of people became very angry. And, you know, I would really like to avoid all of that going forward. And I'm sure all of you who are struggling with the challenges and opportunities of infill development in your neighborhoods, trust me, you don't want to have to add this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'one to your plate as well. So I really encourage all of you to support this. It's it's good policy. It makes sense. And thank you, CPD. And so Jefferson Park, I hope someone is watching this and I know I'll see you tomorrow night, but you won.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Shephard. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Talk about getting down into the weeds. I really appreciate CPD for for locating this and understanding what's going on. You know, I wanted to just give a shout out to my man, John Noble, who is our resident expert in District eight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you for giving your time to work on something like this. We really appreciate it. And we lean on him in District K. Thank you.'",

This is a parcel that's located in Council District eight and is in the Curtis Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's right adjacent to Curtis Park itself. It is an existing parking lot on the northwest corner of 31st and Arapahoe Streets. And and there's a visual of it right there. It is formerly used for the Epworth Church, which is just adjacent to it.'",

The plan does have multiple strategies that are consistent with this proposal, including promoting infill development at appropriate locations, development that's consistent with the character of surrounding neighborhoods, investing in neighborhoods and citywide goals, providing a range of housing types and prices.'",

It is also an area of stability, but very close to an area of change and could be seen as a reinvestment area, acting as a buffer between the historic neighborhood and the kind of changing, mixed use character along Larimer and Lawrence.'",

But I've been a resident in the community for over about 20 years now and have worked with Mr. Kane on their other two projects that have been amazingly successful.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the main reason for their success is because they've listened to the neighbors, they've met with the neighbors, they've redesigned their projects. They've asked us what it is that our community needs and how that product fits in with the existing fabric and and nature of our of our neighborhood.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'So we look forward to working, you know, further with McSwain on some great other infill projects in the area and getting rid of these vacant lots that have been an issue for the neighborhood and seeing that fabric come back together and as this neighborhood just continues to see itself revitalized.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you. And we definitely would like your support on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Pryor. That it finishes our speakers questions from Council Councilman Brooks Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Devitt I have a question for you. I had a question for you in committee around this is to folks they don't know this is on the Enterprise Center which has been it was bought by Indigo Development, sold into three parcels.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this parcel is there is a piece of the parking lot. And I talked about, you know, when we begin to divide up parcels in red zone, what kind of you know, what kind of level do we set around parking, right?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How do we know we're not taking up parking for the next development or anything like that? So were you able to look into that and do you have an answer? Because I am kind of concerned about it for this, but it's more of a macro question for more developments and infill now.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's a good question. I brought up the map here. And as you mentioned, the Enterprise Center and the Upper Epworth Church was one ownership, but it has actually been split. I spoke with the owner of the Epworth Church, and that that split actually occurs in the parking lot that's along the lawns between the former Denver Enterprise Center'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and the Epworth Church. And so any, you know, re-use of the church would actually have off street parking on that parking lot. Okay. So when they, you know, you know, separate those two parcels, they had a discussion and and were able to split the properties of both would have access to parking in that parking lot along Laurens'",
        "'speaker_3': '. Okay. So, but on a, on a larger perspective, you know, around the city, how do you how do you go about that? Well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, parking is tied to the use, whether it's in the new code or the old code. So in Chapter 59, it would depend on what use would go into that that church, which is in the army throw.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's hard to know until you actually have that use whatever parking requirement is necessary.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And here's where I feel like we're in a pickle because we don't exactly know the use of the church just yet. And so, yeah, how do you know if it's you know, they're saying it's not going to be residential, but, you know, how do you know?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, do we set some kind of standards as a city?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. I mean, I guess that's a broader policy discussion. But from a from a zoning perspective, you can only look at the actual parking requirements within his own district. So I did look at the the potential uses in AMI 30.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And you know, if you look at, you know, an office use, for example square footage, the parking that's associated with the former church would would accommodate that off street. And there's always always the. Beyond street capabilities as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. One more question. Go ahead. So this is kind of a larger question as well. And it has to do with when a developer is going through a rezoning process. They have to first, you know, we have to approve it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then they go to the building department and submit their application. Mm hmm. Are you all working on dual tracks so that, you know, running these deals on parallel tracks? Once it maybe passes planning board, it passes committee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it it looks like it's getting that nod for approval that they can submit there to the building department. And just, you know, just so we don't get so many so many issues clogged up in the building department.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No. And I believe they might have actually done that with this case because they're doing a he's doing a lot of amendment as well to split up these this one one lot into four and then as well go through the typical building permit process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So whenever a rezoning comes in and they're looking to do that, we try to accommodate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm more talking about the building department, you know. So let me let me actually ask David just to just ask him about his process. And as we were in this and you've submitted your zoning, were you able to submit into development services and, you know, submitted to the building department as well?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Not right off the bat. You know, that's the goal of most developers. We know that this has multiple tiered parallel processes based on the complexity of sites. Some are more complex than others. We felt that this was very straightforward and the developer was willing to, you know, take the risk of plan, review fees and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What our main intention was was to meet with David, have a pre-application meetings, prepare a planning board commission, and then shortly after Planning Board Commission, go on and, you know, attempt to submit the building permits to the city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Building permits take now 60 to 80 working days. And if he'd back that up to where we are tonight, that would have been the absolute trigger to come out of here tonight with the rezoning work with Kimber and the group and development services to record the zone, layout amendments to split the floor, take that information over to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the building department process, tie out the addresses issue permits. However, we were only able to submit permits to the city and county of Denver upon first reading of City Council after January 3rd, December 13th, which now is going to push our permit timing back to March.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, you know, now I'm on hold a little further and I would like to, you know, the city to look at kind of these parallel green light, other projects that are very complicated. We definitely understand that. But in other jurisdictions we work in around the front range, we're willing to take the risk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're willing to invest the time. We're willing to coach and learn and listen. And I think, you know, it's a proactive approach the city can take. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Burks, Councilman Nevett.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. This is a question for Mr. where it's maybe just a little bit off the subject. I was a big admirer of Maxine's work. There was a big mixed team project down in South Denver, and I was under the impression that Mixed had gone under.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But here you are. You risen from the dead or were you just I think every developer in the recession went under one way or another. We were able to recapitalize. We shed some assets, we capped some projects and kind of hit the reset button in 2010.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So an exchange not gone away. We rejuvenated, along with the rest of the economy and the booming that we see going on. We're much smaller or much a number now, more nimble or smarter than where we were. And when you have, you know, millions of assets that overnight turn into dollars of assets, that creates problems.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's where a lot of us got caught in it, especially on the residential game. So we're glad to be back in here in front of you tonight. It's great to have you back.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Counts benefit and I see no other questions. So I'm going to close the public hearing and ask for comments from council. Councilman Brooks, do you have a comment?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. This is this site has a lot of history. Obviously, the old Enterprise Center, which many of you know about with the city, and it was bought by Integral Development. And Integral Development does affordable housing within the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they team up a lot with the VHA and do a lot of developments. And so they purchased this whole parcel including and sold it to me, saying a piece of the parcels to me saying sold a piece of the Epworth Church to Saint Charles Town Company.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in the church, which is a historic church there, they're going to be there like. You get office uses and also a restaurant. But this parcel and and then there's this. It's almost looks like a school building where the old enterprise center was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's a lot of square footage. And they're looking at a food co-op in that place where you can you can go and buy your groceries. But also, you know, it is an opportunity for folks to to get fresh food in the neighborhood, especially at affordable prices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is a and you know, I want to credit Antiguo development with just having a vision for this property and mixed in and jumping at the opportunity to continue the the excellence in their design and building some single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It looks like we're going to reuse a space, a space that has has gone dormant for many years. And so we're excited about that. And we're excited that there's someone coming in who is not just gonna throw something together.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But as David said, he, he's received many design awards and I didn't even know about the national awards, so congratulations on that. And so, you know, I'll be supporting this, you know, for just the conversation about affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And in the neighborhood of Curtis Park, Denver Housing Authority is the largest landowner in Curtis Park, and they're doing some of the most creative, affordable components. I mean, it's a really a national motto, as you all know. And so I'm very although things are changing in Curtis Parks and there are you know, there are other houses that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'are incredibly expensive. They're because of the creativity and creativity of VHA. There are some incredible affordable components. And so I credit film a lot for this, but I'll be voting in favor of this and be excited to see this entire development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All three parcels come together and activate this part of the city. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call. Brooks. Hi, Brown. But I Herndon. I can eat lemon Lopez Montero, Nevitt Ortega. I Rob Shepherd. Madam President. Hi, Madam Secretary. Close the voting and announce the results.'"

And just to give you context, that 382 acres that are in the station area plan overlaid over downtown would really encapsulate the entire downtown area. So it's a very large area which will require multiple phases over a long period of time for for a full buildout.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With all our stationary plans, where I always establish a vision and key principles and what we say here about 60% Panya is that the station will serve as a vibrant, compact urban center for the regional aerotropolis. A world class, transit oriented community catalyzes development and connects people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And four key ideas that we take out of that vision statement is that it's going to be a transit community, which is something that Rocky has been pushing as a term that we're gradually graduating to, that it will be well connected, it will be a vibrant, compact, urban place, and that will be catalyzing development, sustainable development in'",

I want to say that everyone's worked very hard on this and we spent a lot of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's hard to craft a plan from a wheat field, but the opportunity with the rail stop and DIA in the city picking us to have that rail stop has created this opportunity. We see this as a great plan.'",

And that overlay still exists. And the plan was written to to be able to be an effective plan, whether that regulation stays in place or is'",

        "'speaker_8': 'Is. I think twofold. You know, I think it tries to address affordable housing at this micro level in the station area. Speaking to the opportunities to work with local affordable housing providers, we have a unique opportunity here having writing a stationary plan with a development team that will be actively pursuing it to build out here, and we'll'",
        "'speaker_8': 'have opportunities to to make those partnerships happen. And then also, I think from the macro level, we have to look at how that works within a citywide policy discussion about, you know, affordable housing throughout Denver.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman and Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for your question. I appreciated seeing this in there. And I also appreciate that this team has actually been willing to spend some time exploring different options and meeting with different experts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I do hope that that all comes to fruition. My question was actually a little bit broader, which is when we originally put out the RFP, when DIA put out the RFP, I appreciated that they took some input from council on thinking about connectivity to existing neighborhoods and which station, you know, might provide more of that'",
        "'speaker_1': '. I was just curious whether any ideas emerged that anyone wants to share. I mean, we I feel like we learned some lessons with the Stapleton project where, you know, I don't think that Northeast Park Health feels as connected to Stapleton as we would might like.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quebec has turned out to be quite a barrier and just hasn't been as seamless of old and new. And it's kind of hard to refer to Green Valley Ranch as an old neighborhood, but in this case it will be the older the older cousin, if not the uncle, to this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so I was just curious if any ideas emerged that are in this plan to really have more connectivity between existing and new. And they may not be like written in stone, but just did that conversation go anywhere?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think there's two concepts, especially from a North-South perspective. One is the the regional bike trail that's going to be actually happening on First Creek. So that's a real opportunity to actually have a real legitimate, very high ease of use, bicycle facility connecting Green Valley Ranch up to the station area as well and into the wildlife refuge'",
        "'speaker_8': 'and also Yampa or excuse me, Telluride as a mixed use arterial. So not just a commercial arterial that's just moving people through. But if we build Telluride the right way here in the station area, as it would then extend south and north for that network and particularly south.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That could be a really great street that's, you know, serves multiple modes of transportation and it does connect to the high school that's in Green Valley Ranch. So I think from those two perspectives, we also have recommendations, you know, on Tower Road on and how that eventually gets built out and and is done in a way that'",
        "'speaker_8': 'isn't a barrier in that the town center land use designation around 16/61 is kind of a gateway into the station area, can serve as a kind of a a neighborhood center that everybody in the gateway can access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Kennish. I see no other questions, so I'm going to close. One more.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just have one more. All right. And this is for the city attorney. David, can you just tell us? Whether all of the proposed uses that are on any portion of the desert land that makes up part of these 300 acres is in conformity with the idea.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I might ask Dan to comment on this, but I it's my understanding that the only portion of what you've seen depicted on these maps as affected by the IGA is directly adjacent to where the platform is, where the transit stop would be.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there are were special provisions made originally in 1988 along the transportation quarter there to have a greater diversity of land use from the get go. And Dan, would you confirm if that land is in the transportation corridor area or what what's your familiarity is with this issue?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've we've looked at the uses relative to the idea. And generally this land since is south of 72nd is is has relatively minor is relatively minor impacts from the. Generally speaking, all of the uses are consistent. We believe this these entitlements are entirely consistent with the idea.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And is that particularly because they are on one of the transit corridors?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's because it's addressed in the ACA. The transit corridor is addressed both the transit corridor and the land within the transit corridor that is south of 72nd Avenue, which is a very.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Significant boundary within that agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if I could add, Madam President, the something else to to be said about this is that most of what you see beyond the platform is all private property. And some of the land use restrictions that that that existed in the IJA were only on city property that's under the jurisdiction of the manager of aviation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So when we annexed this major portion of land from Adams County in 1988, it did include some private properties that just are free to be developed. There were no lands in land use restrictions as applied to the private property portions of the annexation, as contrasted with the property that's owned and under the management of the manager of'",
        "'speaker_3': 'aviation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Premiere. Thank you, Mr. Bradwell. I see no other questions. So now I will close the hearing and ask for comments. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. As, as first said, one of the speakers, you know, it's difficult to create a station from a wheat field. And I would second that and even say it's difficult to create a station from a wheat field when you have multiple landowners and then you take into account what's important as a city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'When we develop a station as well, and I have been a part of all these dialogs for a very long time since being elected. And I just want to commend you all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What this project that you are putting together and hearing the interest of councilmembers at the last land use meeting when there were some quiet concerns and questions about bike lanes. And I want to thank David and his team as well for incorporating incorporating as well, because we've taken a lot of time into putting together a product that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think fits everyone's needs. Very excited to see this begin to move forward. I think it was a great and the right decision to make in choosing this station first and looking forward to future stations being built, that one close to the air and also preserving those view, those beautiful views that we have on the mountain, on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the far northeast. And it was a great community input that was received during this. So I'm very supportive of this and certainly hope that my colleagues will support it as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Herndon and Councilman Shep Shepherd. Thank you, Madam President. I promised further I would have a robust dialog going on on bike issues, so I don't want to disappoint you, for know. So when this item came to committee, we had a pretty robust discussion over two sessions regarding the whole bike lanes and potentially protected bike'",
        "'speaker_1': 'lanes, usage of the site and council. President Susman and I were quite adamant at the time that if we were, you know, creating this community from scratch, you know, and there wasn't any of the right away restrictions that we often experience in other parts of town as we are trying to plan and build for the future.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Why shouldn't we? From the bat, you know, include these protected bike lanes because we know that they're in such high demand across the city and across the country. And that led to a really informative discussion with public works that helped educate us on when exactly protected bike lanes specifically might be warranted based on traffic counts and speeds'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and safety issues in certain corridors. And I think that was a really good discussion and very eye opening. But I do want to thank CPD for listening to that discussion and for, you know, in between the first and second time that it came to committee to incorporating additional language, you know, into the plan about how we might'",
        "'speaker_1': 'address these issues going forward. But finally, you know, one of the things that I brought up was around implementation. And, you know, this we have many gorgeous plans sitting on shelves across the city. And I guess one of my concerns is that, you know, there's a bit of a disconnect between, you know, what ends up getting implemented'",
        "'speaker_1': 'in, you know, things getting lost in translation between the planning process and about what actually ends up on the ground as these communities are being planned. And I just want to take this moment to re-emphasize that, you know, I really hope that the opportunity to, you know, really focus on moving people as opposed to cars at this'",
        "'speaker_1': 'incredible site is is a great focus. CBT You've acknowledged that, but I hope public works, you know, takes that you know the full step going forward and I just really want to emphasize that that we don't want to squander those opportunities to really make this a multi-modal city as we do plan out these incredible opportunity sites, especially'",
        "'speaker_1': 'when we are starting from scratch. So, you know, this is my hope that things don't get lost in translation in between planning and implementation. And again, I do want to thank you for including some specific language in the plan around that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I just want to send a message to public works that this is a huge priority, as they well know for myself and this body. So thank you. And I am supporting the plan. Thank you, Councilwoman Shepherd. Well said.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Are there any other comments? I see none. So let's go ahead and do that. Roll call. Herndon I can eat lemon. Lopez All right. Montero I love it. I. Ortega Hi, Rob. Shepherd Hi. Brooks Hi. Madam President. Hi, Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Close the vote and close the. What is it? Let's have the count of the vote. Oh, my word of advice. 12 I civil faces. Congratulations, Councilman Herndon. Now I have no pre adjournment announcements, therefore seeing no business before no other business for this body.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This meeting is adjourned. Denver 80. View your city, your source. Denver eight is about your city. Tell us what you think. I enjoy watching your program because they explain everything thoroughly. The show really.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Keeps me current with the city government.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think the Denver News show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That you have each weekend both an informative and concise time to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Talk back to your television. Call or email.'",
