        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Ken Each has called out Bill 29 for comment and under pending, no items have been called up. Did I miss anything? All right, Madam Secretary, if you'd please put the first item on our screens, which is 1375.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember CdeBaca, go ahead with your questions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is there anybody here who can answer questions? How are you? Very excited to see this caring for Denver dollars get kicked off. Are these part of it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Pardon me?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Are these part of the caring for?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a crime prevention and control commission funds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is this going to go to. So our district was tossing around the potential of a cahoots pilot. Is this that or is this going toward that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not this is separate, although it is my understanding that the Department of Safety has applied to carry for Denver for those funds. And I think that that has been awarded just very recently. But this represents the existing co responder program.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So can you explain to me what this specifically is funding in the crisis, in the co responder program? Is it? How many staff does it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Employee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that the total number of staff is 12 clinicians, which is enough to have a co responder in every police district seven days a week?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And is this adding on co responders or is this funding the current ones?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is funding the current ones? The expansion is that request through caring for Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And can you tell me a little bit about how we monitor our return on investment? What is the evaluation process for our co responders?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. That's it's kind of a tricky thing to measure because often what the co responder does is it prevents something from happening. So it's hard to it's hard to monetize a counterfactual, something that that didn't happen that might have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can give you some numbers of the number of incidents that happened in 2018 and sort of the outcomes of some of those, if that's helpful. But it's not really like a true return on investment in a in a percentage.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Give me 2 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. This is a very exciting and important part of the work being done, but.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's really great stuff. Okay. In 2018, the Crisis Intervention Response Unit responded to 1725 incidents that had the potential to escalate. Of that 1725, 69 individuals received a citation or arrest. 286 were placed on an emergency mental health hold.'",
        "'speaker_4': '71 were connected to housing and treatment. 13 resulted in detox and 567 engaged in continued services with MH KD for various diagnoses like bipolar, depression, PTSD, schizophrenia.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so how in the future will we determine if this is a program that we want to expand or continue funding? What are our metrics for that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the Crime Prevention and Control Commission is looking continues to. To perform an analysis on every program. And in this particular one, I think we do need to look at different metrics and figure out how do we identify a a, you know, an actual dollar amount, like a cost return on investment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At this time, we haven't identified that. So I, I can tell you that we continue to work on it. And as as you're now on the commission, you'll be part of that work.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Awesome. And quick question about the 12 that are in each district. Do we find that they're necessary in all of the districts or do we find that most of the incidences are coming in specific district?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't have that information, but I'd be happy to work with KD on on getting that and seeing if we can't provide that, you know, some some sort of heat map that shows geographically like if there's a, if there's some imbalance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Got it. And so what exactly is warranting the amended 700 just a continuation or.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. So for the for the past couple of years, we've actually had this contracted at $1,000,000. But because MHC is able to build Medicaid for some portion of the services that they deliver when they're Medicaid members, they're actually seeing a return from Medicaid around 40%.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we're requesting $700,000 to operate the co responder program in its current state for 2020. And that just kind of chews up the amount that that the city actually expends.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And these are not PCC dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are CPC.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So these are from the pilot dollars given to KPCC to administer or what budget are we using these dollars for?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the PCC is a special revenue fund through the expanding authority is the Department of Public Health and Environment. So like that's the the budget that it sits in. Is that does that answer?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, that's fine. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That's all the questions I had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Gilmore, do you also have questions on this one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No. President Clark, I just have a comment.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much for this contract. It's a very important time for this to come through our city. And I'm really looking forward to following the work. And so more information that you can provide, especially for us to get out to the community so they know or if they're contacted by the police, if they could request a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'correspondence or request someone to accompany a police officer when they make those phone calls. Sure. That would be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Really, really helpful. Sure. We're currently working on our 2019 evaluation now. So hopefully we'll have some, you know, some some updated information that we can talk about, like how did it work in 2019? Those numbers I gave you were were 2018.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so we'll be happy to share that with council, you know, as we get it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, great. And then, you know, we've unfortunately had some youth violence tragedies over the past few months, but then also families that just they were in that gap where they weren't able to access mental health supports. And so I guess beyond when a co responder accompanies a police officer, will you be tracking or I'm requesting that you'",
        "'speaker_2': 'do track where there's a gap or where there's a gap in services so that we're really avoiding sending folks off on kind of a wild goose chase. And then they get frustrated and they can't get the services. And so then they kind of close up and try to do things internally.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. Absolutely. I mean, some of those conversations are already happening as we work with the Department of Safety on their, you know, initiatives on their side. But we'll be will be happy to, you know, make a make a point of of keeping an eye on that so we can report back.'"

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is there anybody here to answer questions on this contract? Can you introduce yourself?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. I'm John Looper with Department of Housing Stability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Awesome. Thank you so much for coming up tonight. Very excited about these dollars for motel vouchers have had some challenges when recommending this option to constituents because we're not really sure who to direct them to and how to know when we've spent down our vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm wondering if in the coming year if there's any new infrastructure electronically that's being built to track our our vouchers in real time? Or how do we as city council representatives know what's left in our voucher bank when we're trying to connect constituents to these emergency services?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for as far as like an electronic way of tracking or a voucher bank, we don't really have that set up yet. That's something we could look into in the future. This specific contract is really for the family motel, which is for 30 rooms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's that's kind of it's. It's managed between the Volunteers of America, our office, Department of Housing, Stability, and then Department of Human Services. So Human Services has different outreach workers that write the vouchers to this program. And then Volunteers of America also has a an evening voucher rider that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Vouchers to this program also and they work out of Samaritan House every evening.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So how do we know what our usage is throughout the year?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So for this this specific contract, it's pretty much 100% use. I think the the occupancy is in the high nineties and they serve about just over a thousand families within a year. There are a couple of other contracted motels and that's kind of as an add need basis as the this family motel fills and they have to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'overflow into other motels that are contract motels.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when you say 100% utilized, what does that mean? Does that mean that they're 100% full right now and we have a waiting list or what is that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're in the high nineties for their utilization. So at some nights they're at 100%. And we're we're sending families to contracted motels. The other motels other nights they might be 90% full. And so it just kind of varies night to night.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Average stay is about ten days. So families there, though, some of them may stay for just a night. Some of them may stay for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the needs of that family.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so is there with this specific one, are there preconditions of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do you how do you qualify to get into.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So really, if if a family is homeless in Denver, there could be. A man or woman. As long as they have children and they're homeless in Denver, they just need to connect with the Department of Human Services with their general assistance program Monday through Friday through from, I believe it's eight four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then if they aren't at Denver, Human Services between that timeframe, they would utilize Samaritan House with the voucher riders that are there in the evenings and they'll they'll ask questions. Usually if people are residents of Denver or they're homeless in Denver, they can get multiple nights and then they can meet with a staff member to look'",
        "'speaker_3': 'at some kind of future planning for them if they're from out of state. They're usually always given one night. And then there we figure out what the next steps would be for that family.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So before we send somebody to the Samaritan House.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or Denver Human Services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How do we know if we're at the 90% or 100%? Because it's hard to send someone who has very little resources to a Denver Human Services spot during the day knowing that that night there are not going to be any vouchers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Who do we contact?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that would be during the day. It'd be it would be human services, general assistance. And I don't have that number handy, but just through Human Services, the General Assistance Department, they'll be able to answer that question. It's hard to contact Volunteers of America in the evening to find that out because they're they're seeing people as they're'",
        "'speaker_3': 'coming in. We don't. I think what you're getting at is we don't really have like a like a system that's showing the actual users. They keep track of that on hand as people are coming in. So that's something that could be improved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is there a plan for that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm not sure. So there's a are the Department of Housing Stability, they're going through a strategic planning process. And part of that's going to be the shelter strategy planning. And so that may be part of that.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. I'm calling this out just to help our community draw attention to the milestone that we are passing tonight. So Denver had one of the earliest ordinances in the country for nondiscrimination at the local level at a time when, you know, we were looking more to states to do some of this work'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And in particular, they're very ahead of our time in terms of adding things like sexual orientation to the protected groups that could not be discriminated against. In fact, that ordinance created a ballot measure which then created the backlash, along with other ordinances that turned out to be Amendment two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this this ordinance and the nondiscrimination has a really long history, but even good things need a cleanup every now and then. And so tonight we are cleaning up Denver's anti-discrimination ordinance and modernizing it in a number of ways that really just conform to state law.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, for example, breastfeeding protections that exist in state law now will be echoed here. Protections for, for example, based on religious exemptions will now match the state's exemptions. Right. So so some of that is just conforming. There are some, however, really important pieces in here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just want make sure our community knows about it. Under this ordinance, it would be prohibited to discriminate based on national origin or national origin or immigration status. Right. Unless you were administering some state or federal program that had those requirements built in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you can't say, well, you're not allowed to, you know, get housed here because of your immigration status or your background. So that is a really important new protection. And it actually was something really advocated for by our immigrant rights community back in 2017 and 2018.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I really want to thank our Department of Human Rights and Community Partnerships and all of the commissions that they worked with because they think that keeping up with, you know, making sure that our city is inclusive to our earlier proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. This kind of makes sure that everyone in our community is abiding by those high standards. It also modernizes some of the language for our LGBTQ community. We updated some of that last year with another bill, but just kind of making sure that we are, you know, being inclusive to those who are gender non-conforming as.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So even though a long history and a long, long legacy of nondiscrimination is already practice here, it's good for us all to brush up on what's been improved in this ordinance, making sure that landlords and employers and those to business in the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I encourage folks to look up the new ordinance after we adopt it, learn about it, reach out and ask for a presentation from our agency if they need it. And I again just want to thank the community and those who helped to make sure that we were we're keeping up with making sure that our city stays'",

And I'm going to walk you through the designation application of four 4431 East 26th Avenue.

        "'speaker_5': 'Ordinance. This designation application that you are considering this evening is the last one to be reviewed under the old ordinance, which was updated with your approval just this past year. Currently, we have 347 individual structures and 56 historic districts designated in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that equals about 7000 buildings across the city, or approximately 4% of the city, or one and 25 structures that are designated landmarks. The designation process is community driven and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons.'",

This is located in the North Park Hill Neighborhood Council District Number eight, Christopher Herndon in Blueprint, Denver.'",

They must maintain their historic and physical integrity and finally be considered by the Landmark Preservation Commission for relation to historic context or theme.'",

See, it is 30 years old and it has direct and substantial association with a person or group of persons who had influence on society. It meets architecture eight embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type, and it also meets geography.'",

He gained wealth in banking and real estate, developing properties like the Kittredge Building, which is still downtown and the now demolished Kittredge Castle in Denver's Montclair neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Kittredge developed real estate in Park Hill under the Parkhill Heights Realty Company, including the blocks on Claremont Street between 26 and 28th Avenues, of which the property at 4431 East 26th Avenue was a part. He would continue his real estate ventures in other East Denver neighborhoods like Montclair and East Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In the center is Charles Ginsberg. In 1920, he purchased the property and lived there until 1929. During that period, Ginsburg actively engaged in the racial politics that dominated Denver and Colorado at that time, specifically in opposition to the Ku Klux Klan stronghold on local and state political leadership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ginsberg, who was Jewish, debated Klan supporter Reverend William Oscar at the University of Colorado in May 1924. The well-attended debate is considered by some to be the single most successful anti Klan events in Colorado and contributed to the downfall of the hate group in the state.'",

He operated Forest Mountaineering Ltd, inventing and selling technical mountaineering gear that advanced the sport.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'He even tested some of the gear on the house itself, including the pounding pitons and the brick, the holes of which you can still see in the property to this day two, of course, most well-known inventions are a wall hammer that you see pictured on the screen and the Denali Snowshoe invented during his residency at 4431 East'",

The curvilinear shaped gables and String course illustrate the mission revival style while the exposed rafter ends knee braces at eaves, overhanging eaves and divided upper window lights illustrate the craftsman style.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The structure also represents the tuberculosis home form. When the structure was built in 1911, tuberculosis was still a national pandemic and Colorado's climate conducive to natural treatment of the disease. The characteristic feature of such structures is the sleeping or cured porch where patients could take in the fresh air.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All the bedrooms in this structure are located on the West End. So in the fort excuse me, photo you see on the screen on the right open directly onto an enclosed porch with 15 large windows. The structure is also prominently located on a large parcel consisting of four lots.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is one of a few houses along 26th Avenue in this area, Park Hill, with its facade facing 26th Avenue, as opposed to facing the side street as most homes are situated in the neighborhood. The mission revival style architecture lends to the prominence of the property, as it is not a prevalent style in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In respect to integrity, the primary structure retains a high degree of integrity, of location, design, setting materials, workmanship and association alterations have been minimal and the key character defining features of the structure, like the curvilinear shaped gables brick coursework, stained glass in large windows of the enclosed cured porch are preserved.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Likewise, the location and setting of the property have experienced minimal change over time. The solar panel installation on the roof does affect the aspect of feeling because it introduces a modern feature to a historic house. However, the panels are reversible and their placement maintains the original roof slope with a flush minimum rise above the roof plane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They do not conceal the essential physical features of the property that help it meet its its significance under the designation criteria. So ultimately the property retains the identity for which it is significant. The property does have multiple periods of significance, including 1911 to 1915, 1922, 1929 and 1971 to 1998.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The property relates to several historic contexts and themes, including Colorado's history of tuberculosis treatment. In the late 1800s and early 1900s. Early development of Park Hill from the late 1880s and early 1900s influenced the Ku Klux Klan, Denver and Colorado politics during the 1920s, and also the growth and prominence of Colorado's outdoor recreation industry from the 1970s'",
        "'speaker_5': 'onward. Designation of this property is consistent with the comprehensive plan with Blueprint Denver and the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan completed in 2000. This includes several comprehensive plan vision elements, most directly the strong and authentic neighborhoods vision element, which includes the goal to preserve the authenticity of Denver's neighborhoods and celebrate our history, architecture and culture.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It also meets the environmental, religious, resilient vision element, specifically the goal and strategy to mitigate climate impacts by significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the use of renewable energy sources. The solar panel array on the roof of the primary structure illustrates a successful application of energy efficiency improvements that are compatible with the character of the historic property'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is also consistent with Blueprint Denver's vision to improve quality of design that preserves and creates authentic places, and the strategy that recommends using historic designation to ensure residential neighborhoods retain their unique character as infill development occurs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then finally, the designation also supports the vision and goals of the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan that call for the preservation of areas of historical significance through designation, as well as preservation of the community's historic character. In summary, the property meets the criteria for landmark designation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It meets one designation criterion in all three categories. It maintains its historic and physical integrity, and it relates to several historic contexts or themes. Ten members of the public have commented in support of designation. There has been no opposition and the Landmark Preservation Commission unanimously recommended its approval.'",

So this would be a great addition to the neighborhood and this is a terrific house in terms of it's got all of the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's got architecture, that great mission revival style. It's got geography. But it's especially, I think, stand out on the history. We have three really incredible people associated with this House. I think if any one of those people would have lived in this house, it would have met criteria for history designation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we have three. So. So I'm just very excited to see this come forward and speak in support. And thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would you mind just stating your name for the record?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Amy Zimmer.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. Next up, George Dennis.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Wow. Good evening. My name is George and I am an old house addict. But our heads lately have been filled with nothing but real estate tycoons, lawyers and hate speech, divisive actions in the neighborhoods, all kinds of far right sorts of things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Now, a house, if you like, to think of it this way, the windows are its eyes. And Jeff House has seen it all before. It has seen partizan, right wing conservative nastiness to its own population. It has seen boom and bust of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It has even seen the CU, the John Denver, the emergence of Colorado as a destination. And it has endured it has also endured the biggest blizzard Denver ever saw in 1913, two world wars, a major depression. And in spite of all that, this House still has the same style she came in with.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we think that it's well worthy of preservation and recognition for its past. But I would also like to bring up some of its future. Being old doesn't necessarily get you a free pass. Instead, I would like to point out that Cage Greenhouse is also darn near carbon neutral solar drives, geothermal heating and cooling system, and therefore'",
        "'speaker_3': 'it is a minimal impact on the environment and will continue to be so for the next century. Even so, any of the three individuals that Jenny told you about, plus the ten or 12 other owners who have been there in the intervening years, would absolutely recognize their old house is even in pretty close to the original colors'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So for those reasons, its past, its present and its impact on the future, which hopefully won't be much. We think that it is well worth preservation recognition from the council. And thank you for your votes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Beverly Dennis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello. My name is Beverly Dennis and I live at 4431 East 26th Avenue. I, too, want to thank you for your time tonight to meet with us and talk about my old house as prior owners. We were sitting outside waiting because we wanted to make sure we made the meeting this week.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We came last week, but we were here too late, so we left at 430 today and we were waiting outside. Each time the elevator opened and no one came out or went in, we set up. There's Charlie.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, there's Bill. And. Doors opened more, more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Frequently than I thought they would be without someone inside. Not that I believe in that kind of thing. When we first looked at the house, it was in a great bit of disrepair. We walked around. And for some reason, the House just spoke to us.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, for me, it was like, we need to we need to buy this house or it's going to get torn down. And and it was in such bad repair that when we called the realtor and said, we'd like to make an offer, she said, You're kidding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then we said, No, we're quite serious. So we we bought the house and then started our our. Adventure with it. We couldn't understand why when we redid the windows, there was quarter inch glass and all of the main windows on the first on the main floor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Then we heard Ginsberg's tape talking about the Klux Klan ambushing him on the corner of 26th and Colorado Boulevard. I'm sure that that glass went in as a bullet proof preventer preventive after that incident. So all of my cursing of him for the quarter inch glass and the broken windows because of it was understandable.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're now working.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the dining room and.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Ginsburg was a great cigar smoker, so much so that all of the wood in our dining room is black.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oak.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Totally black. So we're having to send it down to raw wood to break it back. But we're doing that swearing at Charlie along the way with this. Great history that the House has. We would really like to see it maintain its integrity for the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I really hope that you will vote for our designation and help us keep this house going. We don't view ourselves as the owners. We view ourselves as the caretakers. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers on this item. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Jenny. On this house. You discussed a little bit the solar panels that are on the front roof. And I know that our design guidelines for solar on landmark buildings does not permit that. So can you tell me what the discussion was at the staff level of of recommending approval of a building that has'",
        "'speaker_3': 'elements that we would not allow on an already landmarked building if the owner there had requested it. What was the discussion about that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, we actually discussed this at length. This was the first conversation we had about its eligibility for designation. The guidelines do recommend that solar panels be as non-visible as possible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there are two.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Two thirds. When you look at the images and the design guidelines, you see buildings that are generally front gables. So it's hard when you've a house like this where there's side gables to make that argument. So there are some exceptions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are different, you know, levels of meeting the design guidelines for a solar array installation. And while this one doesn't meet that RIR two thirds, it does meet a lot of other parts of the design guidelines as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'These are reversible. They are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Excuse me. What does reversible mean?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if you remove them, it doesn't match the building itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. When I read the staff report, I thought, I mean, you can turn them upside down.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, that'd be interesting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Do you mean they're removable, not reversible?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, yes. Yeah. Reverse. Yes, through movable reversible. Yeah. We kind of use those two things for the same meaning, but they're also following the roof slope as well. They are, you know, coming off of the pitch of the roof, they're not going over the top.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. So there are a lot of things that it does made its but it rear to third with this house was difficult.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Because of the the the gate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because of the side facing Gables.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. Dennis Crasher, did you put these up to the mike so that people can hear on who are watching on Channel eight? Sorry. Did you put the solar panels on? Not me personally. No, they were. But you had them put on amnesty, so I'll put a plug in for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And they did a like a very discreet, I think we would call it job. They they sit on top of on rails, on top of the roof flying. Right. They look very discreet in the pictures. All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. They look very discreet in the pictures. Yes. And and it's just nice only sending, you know, exhale 40 bucks a month for heating that place. Thank you, Jenny. Could that be building on these answers? Because obviously this is a structure that is quite eligible.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could I ask you to come to the mike again? Thank you. Mr. Downs, did the discussion on this cause any of the staff to consider, given our challenges today and our are wanting to encourage more solar installations, would the staff use this example, which is obviously something that meets every other criteria other than we wouldn't allow them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to put it on tomorrow morning after we vote on this if if they should get it to allow under our design guidelines similar installations on already landmarked properties given our our our interest in climate action. Sure. That's something you might consider.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. And first, I'll mention this was in your staff brief too, that, you know, as some repair and maintenance may need to be made to this solar panel array. Yes, we would just allow for it as is like you couldn't.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think there's actually room to add more in the front, but it couldn't change from what it is currently. But yes, through this consideration for this designation, we are looking to make some updates to our design guidelines in general and this would be one of those topics that we would consider moving forward, and we could use'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this as an example for them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President. I would encourage that actually, because we landmark buildings, but I don't think we mean to put a bell jar over them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No, not at all.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the fact is that 100 years after 109 years after this house was built, if it didn't have solar panels on it and it were a historic landmark, I wouldn't want to see us stand in the way of trying to help achieve our goals by having this this restriction.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a landmark building. It just happens to have a solar a solar panels on its roof. Hmm. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And even though you veered a little bit off of questions in the comment ceremony to say and I and I agree with you right there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's why that's why you let me go.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 1364 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Council member Herndon. Did you want to go first? Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. This is exciting. I and this is so controversial.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We feel that. We feel the chambers. You're kidding. Now, this is wonderful. I met with the as a while ago, and I remember when you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'First told me about it, I wasn't familiar with where it was.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then when I drove by, like, I drive by.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This house all the time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As I drove down 26 and I saw that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I'm excited to vote yes on this. Thank you for your due.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Diligence and working to preserve it. We had lengthy conversations in the office and you were telling me stories that were just really remarkable. So this is. I welcome I welcome this, and I would encourage my colleagues to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the criteria have been met. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilmember Herndon, Councilmember Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say thank you for making the effort to apply for this. And I loved both of your comments so very, very much. They were very heartfelt. And it really makes us all feel really good about our city and that you care about that building.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And hello, Amy. I will be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Black Council Member Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just wanted to reiterate what Councilman Black said. Thank you for proactively going out and adding this landmark designation to your house. We have many structures in northwest Denver in the neighborhood I was grown up in, and I represent that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm encouraging people to do this more proactively. I get emails often on what can we do to stop the demolition of homes in North Denver? And this is the only protection that we have. We can do overlays and tweak the zoning, but the only way that we will not demo the history of Denver is to add these'",
        "'speaker_5': 'protections such as yourself. So thank you so much for proactively doing it and tell your neighbors that we welcome these proactive owner designations here at City Council. So thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. Seeing no other comments, I will just add and again, echo what Councilmember Flynn had said about solar. I really hope that we dove deep into that. I would hate to see us as this climate crisis continues to escalate, start to force people into a situation where they are looking at the environmental impact of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'not being able to put solar on a historic or a piece of property building and preserve it versus tear it down to meet some of those goals, because we all know that there's a huge environmental impact to, you know, scraping something like this and building something new.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I think I'm excited that you're taking that on. I'd love to find ways for the council to be involved in that, because I think that that is an important evolution in our preservation ordinances. So and then I also want to add that I also there's although this is not in my district, I also drive by'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this house all the time because this is a couple of blocks away from where my sister lives, who is one of council member Herndon's constituents. And just echo what other councilmembers have said. And thanks to you, you know, Councilmember Cashman, who always says that when you designate a property like this, it's a gift that you're giving to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'our city. And so on behalf of the residents of my district, I want to say thank you for your passion and for your gift that you giving the city and for your words. Tonight, I'm excited to support it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, let's vote to recall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Herndon. I black. I see tobacco. I. Flit i. Gilmore. I. Hines. Cashman. Kenny Ortega. I seen the ball. I. Sawyer, i. Torres, i. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. And I don't know if our. If everybody has to push their button there or the screen was just taking time to catch up. Madam Secretary, please, because voting announced the results.'",
        "'speaker_1': '12 as.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well as Council Bill 1364 has passed. Congratulations. See no other business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.'"
