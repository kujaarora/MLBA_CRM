        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry? Crystal Torres de Herrera, deputy city attorney for the city for the Denver City Attorney's Office. I'm happy to answer these questions. These are important questions. As you guys as all of you may recall, there was actually robust discussion on the council floor when the framework agreement actually came before council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I remember vividly because we did have several members of the community here, which I was really proud to see, because I think it is really important to hear their voices as well. And I know that Councilwoman Ortega and Council man Brooks were very much a part of the conversations, both with the Citizens Advisory Committee, as well as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'with the other community members that were here. And there was a robust conversation at the time about what was the board composition, what was it going to be? And. Councilman Espinosa, I know you asked several questions that we dialoged about at that moment here in front of this body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilwoman can issue might have I wasn't sure if it was right around your recent nuptials. So you may not have been here for that vote. So I think it was right around that time. But at any point we did discuss the importance of having community representation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But ultimately where the agreement ended up was that there was going to be a voting member of the community as well as a non-voting. And I will tell you that when the framework agreement was first. Discussed and put in writing among the partners.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did go to the Citizens Advisory Committee. We actually went to them first before we filed it with council, and it was in those conversations with the community that we actually came up with the non-voting seat and it was at the behest of the community who said, Well, wait a minute, what happens if we have somebody on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'there and they're either not able to attend that day who votes for the community or what happens if they move on? There's nobody there in the wings who's been there to appreciate and understand the decisions that have been made within that body.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we said, you know what? That is a fair concern. That is something that we need to address. And it was because of those conversations that we added the non-voting member. And so, you know, we didn't. Now, did they get the second voting member?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, but we added the additional non-voting member. I will also say from a process standpoint, not only did we have a lot of conversations with the CAC, but we invited and Councilman Brooks and Councilwoman Ortega can attest to this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There was a conversation with the mayor as well, and it was about hear this, here's the composition and what we are looking for in board members. Here are the attributes, the characteristics that we think are important to sit on this board and fill these seats.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was really important. I want to thank everybody who contributed to that because that was really, really key. And we took those we took those attributes to heart. And I think you can see that from the people that we have in front of you today that the mayor proposed, that, you know, we want to make sure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that whoever sits on this board understands the incredible, valuable role that the surrounding neighborhoods play. And it's not just a one time role. It is an ongoing role. And it is about this project not just being a successful project, but it's about how do we share the opportunity with the surrounding communities and make sure that they benefit'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as well. The other conversation we had on the council floor that evening when I came to last spoke about this, was about the community benefits agreement. And the mayor did a letter that I read from at that meeting that I had also shared with Councilwoman Ortega ahead of the Monday night.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That evening was that the mayor had also included and mandated to the incoming board members that we would do a community benefits agreement. We needed to work with that, but that we had to value and make sure that this board was responsive to and working and collaborating, being respectful, inclusive with the surrounding communities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that we're really proud of that work. We couldn't have gotten there without the help of, frankly, Councilman Brooks, Councilwoman Ortega and the community that we talked with. There were some really important strides that happen here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we're excited to get this board in, let this authority get up and running so we can start doing the good work that we've talked about so we can start working on the community benefits agreement because that is what the board, the authority board will do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is their that is part of their job. So we're really excited about that. But I just wanted to make sure all of you were aware of the process and the conversations that went in to get us to this point.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. I'm sure you can sit right there because we got some more comments in there. Let me see Councilman Flynn, Europe and then Councilman Neal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to remind everybody that the the debate, as Ms.. De Herrera just outlined, the debate over whether to have two voting members from the community occurred during the approval of the framework agreement a while back.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So tonight is not the time to not fill the seats that we agreed to have on the board. Tonight is the time to fill those seats that we did agree and then perhaps further that debate. But it would actually take an amendment to the framework agreement that we approved a while back to get that second voting member'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And I am sympathetic to that cause as well. But this vote tonight is not the place or the vote to say we should have a second community voting member. We need to fill the seats that we already agreed to have and then proceed to that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, good point, Councilman Neal. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I'm in favor of voting. I support this today, but I missed the point. The rationale for the non-voting member. And I didn't quite hear that from everything that you said. Could you can you simplify that? I'm from the South, so you have to go speak slowly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So but I just want to understand the rationale for one voting and one non-voting. Do somebody say that we don't need. A second voting member for some reason. What was the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Reason?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we did have. So when the framework agreement, when we initially were talking to our partners and trying to figure out what was the right balance and the board composition of the seats, there was a lot of priority about having a small and nimble board that could make actions because you have to have a you know, you'",
        "'speaker_4': 'really want a odd number of voting seats because of that. In the event of a tie, you need someone to break a tie. Right. And we were talking about what was the right distribution. And there's a lot of behind the scenes conversations between the partners about, you know, do the equity partners, do CSU and WCC, do they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'get two seats? Do they get four seats? What does that look like? So that conversation happened. You know, in the course of the framework agreement, when we came to the community, they said, hey, we appreciate that you gave us the seat.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'd like this other seat. But from a math and other reason standpoint, we decided to go that it was because we'd already drafted the framework or agreement and we said, this is going to be the best resolution to this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We also felt that by having that non-voting seat that that gave, there was no gaps in terms of if somebody couldn't attend the meeting or if there was he or if John wanted to get off. We didn't know what the point that was going to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'John's AP But if John's even decided, you know what, I've been here a year, I'm going to go do something else that somebody could step into the shoes. So it was that was the rationale. They did meet with the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mayor decided that that was the way he wanted to go as well. Now, I will say this. There are various touch points in this authority that have to have that they have to have with the community. Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or it doesn't work. That's just a fact. And so. The board is an important touchpoint, but it's not the only touchpoint. And we have specifically embedded things in the framework agreement and in the instructions to the board members about the community benefits agreement, about the way they're going to interact about the Community Investment Fund.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are other touchpoints because the only way this works is to have everybody's features embedded and to make sure that in order for this project to succeed, the community succeeds as well. And so we've tried very hard to do that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much, sir. So it really was the mayor's decision. He felt that was the best way to go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It was. It was the mayor's decision and it was our decision as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Neal. And thank you, everybody, for weighing in. Obviously, this is a tough issue. And I think, Councilman Flynn, you underlined it pretty well that, you know, we agreed to this in the framework agreement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The meeting that I had with the mayor, with members of the community was saying to the mayor, this is this is an opportunity for you to use one of your seats and take care of this with the community voting member, you know, and so that's that what I want to say is the individuals that are here today'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that the mayor picked, especially from the community and thank you for serving and we're going to need you in the future. This is so, so incredibly important. And your leadership means everything right now. And so regardless of this conversation that's being had right now, I think there's still an opportunity for a lot of success in the future'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you. Council President Brooks I think Monique just want. Monique Lovato Yeah, it's west, west side right now, right. West Denver in the house. Look, I didn't I was just I got into the. Our cultural norm of doing questions and then answer and think kind of in.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Public hearing mode. So forgive me if I didn't say this later, earlier, but I and I appreciate the question being answered. However, you know, when we approved the farm framework, I didn't. Get the peeing like I like my colleague council woman can each kind of realizing this today right tonight that this has been an issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So having said that, I'm still actually pretty concerned that we don't have that other vote. Are there any other positions on the board that are on the board but don't have a vote? Or is it just a community one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is another position on the board that doesn't have a vote. It is the CFO of the city. We have a standing spot for the CFO in the city. We think that's important and that person does not have a vote as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I appreciate that, Crystal. Look, I just. I'm. I just remain concerned about. Not having that community voice or that vote, especially because this is in Globeville. I think it's Illyria. Sorry. Local area swans and geese. You know, I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I love this talk show. I absolutely love being a part of it. I love seeing it being revitalized. I love seeing it being revived. We went on a tour. My first term in council. And we saw that it was falling apart.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We saw that it was not seamless with the community. There was just a lot of improvements that needed to take place. And I was, you know, excited, excited to see it move forward. I'm still excited to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I don't want anybody to think that this is something as a statue I voted for, to see, campaign for, to see. I think it's a just a great opportunity to keep it here and take it to the next level and create that that seamless experience and then just blended into the community and not have a project'",
        "'speaker_0': 'where it's kind of like L.A. Live, where it's kind of its own little Disneyland. There's the community, right, and separate. And I think a lot's being done to do that. But. I have a hard time accepting that just the two an extra community member on that board cannot vote.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that just it just doesn't seem like it's it's it's valued enough to vote that that vote voice is isn't as strong as the others. And it happens to be from this community that lives in the shadow of the highway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. That has gone three decades without a grocery store, has a home, you know, a lot of a lot of infrastructure needs. So I think, you know, for me, I have a hard time. I mean, the first thing I want to say is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would love to see some kind of, you know, rehashing of that that agreement. I think, you know, there is definitely an opportunity to look at that. Again, I know this might not be the proper place and I acknowledge that, Councilman Flynn, but.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The organizer. I mean, the community organizer me has an issue with that. With not having that vote. So it's nothing against the to stock show as an organization or the work that everybody's put in. But I just think that that voice is critical and especially coming from this neighborhood.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just to clarify the record, I'm sure the long lived historical record of this very important road. I am just record. I'm not protesting the the the composition in terms of voting in non-voting. I agree with Councilman Flynn that that's been decided.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's because questions were raised about the slate. Yeah. And the who. And so it is not an attempt to reopen questions in the agreement, although the points by my colleagues on that are are well taken. But my personal vote is about concerns raised about the slate.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. I will be supporting this and looking forward to to continue conversations of opportunities down the road.

So the first piece of this is just to be clear on any time, any time the city disposes of a piece of land like this, we go through a clearance and release process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it is sent to a number of departments and agencies so that they can weigh in on whether there is something going on within the city right of way related, affordable housing related, that if we need to pull it back or have a conversation, we can have that first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's only after it passes that hurdle that then we would consider moving forward with a sale. As it relates to the master planning councilwoman, our master planning is done by the key agencies, quite frankly, which is what drives our some of our real estate needs versus a master plan for individual properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm happy to speak to you about that at another time. But on this particular site, the uniqueness is that the parcel is, I believe, if I remember correctly, approximately 28 feet wide because it is an L-shape, it runs parallel to 40th and Ulster.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It actually is strangely configured that on the 40th side he owns the property on either side. So this is more just kind of completing what he has, which has buildings already there. So he's not building on it, but it's it's finishing it out in terms of landscaping and lighting and things like that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Lisa, will you just tell us how we arrived at the $10,000 price? Sure. We did not do an appraisal. We normally don't do an appraisal on something small in value. If it's if we're looking at existing comps in the general area and there was a range of comps, we discounted it based on the fact that it is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'not buildable, first and foremost, that it's right at an intersection. We also realize that there's a cost avoidance because of maintenance and it'll put it back on tax rolls.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much for addressing my questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. I take it, Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is it says District nine. That's not correct. It's an district date. I'm very familiar with this. I've been working with the property owner for a while. He acquired the the property. He'd been trying to do some grading improvements, but he can't because the city owns part of the land.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it greatly complicates it when there are multiple property owners. And so these conversations have been going on for months and I've been talking with this gentleman and his frustration. So I'm happy to see that this is finally coming to council so that he can do this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I appreciate it's trying to support this business. As Lisa talked about, it's an L-shaped property and it's north of the train tracks in Quebec Square. So the store commercial there, there is no residential in this area. So that would even be a consideration, not even taking into account the fact, the consideration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I, I am I'm supporting this and I'm thankful that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has finally come to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Point where we can support this business owner. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Herning intensively.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't mean to belabor this, but I just want to be clear, Lisa, when this came through committee on consent a few weeks ago, we had a phone conversation. About it. And a couple of things struck me as odd about this, and you were able to answer them, but something is different tonight.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Are we actually conveying the entire L or is it only the lower leg?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, no. And you're right, when we spoke, which is there was a different exhibit that I sent out. I thought you got it as well, because I know when Councilman Espinosa had also asked the question. So there is the smaller L, so it does have a leg to it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then there is the larger piece that is the second conversation, not with real estate, but public works. That is the the longer. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. And in that case, I think we're just talking about another vacation. Correct. So then it would revert to the adjoining property. And then the last funny thing about this is what we actually call 40th Avenue here, where people drive on if they choose to go to the east there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's actually this this owner's property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct. That's why.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We continue after this sale where we continue to have a right of access for the public to to reach that otherwise landlocked parcel down towards San.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Creek.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, and that parcel part of one is ours. And yes, there is an access agreement that runs through there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. That's all I'm saying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. Also, I agree that this is a this is just sort of worthless parcel to the city. But that said, it is not worthless to the property owner and that that is what I take issue with here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm glad that we're charging $10,000 in this case and not giving away like one and a half acres that we gave to CDOT for their headquarters. But that said, land in this area and if this gentleman did just buy it is in the 8 to $9 a square foot range for the industrial land.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we're doing this at a fraction in that delta between. And it is worth more to him because it becomes part of his assemblage than it is to the city. That is an $80,000 gap that that granted that is a that is peanuts on the grand scheme of things in the city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But that is three tiny homes that that in the in the tiny home village that we just did. And so that is real dollars that could go to something. And and we should ask for it. And maybe we did in this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This guy was totally unreasonable. But if it is as challenging as is, it is. You know, that's one of those things that I just wish real estate would push more in this situation, because that is a public asset, even though it's it's sort of an odd shaped sliver that is, like I said, functionalist, unless you acquire it'",
        "'speaker_1': 'and put it as part of an assemblage, because then he can develop 11 towers, you know, redevelop that property sometime in the future, which is going to benefit from other projects that we're doing in the city. So it's more just the philosophical thing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think you guys have heard me say that enough. But I just wanted to not belittle this and say that it's just this little disposable thing. It has real value. And we're not charging at less than a dollar a square foot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're not charging that value. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, just wanted to put this on the floor, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Initially I had questions. I wasn't sure if I was going to call it out for a vote. And so my questions were answered. And I appreciate Lisa taking the time to call me this afternoon and review them with me.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I mean, I agree that this is not a developable site, this parcel. But at some point in time, this this landowner may choose to sell this property, which makes it even more valuable. It could be developed. It's near Smiths Road, you know, which is considered a TOD site, you know, at various locations along that corridor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, we've worked really hard to make sure that we do have affordable housing. And in housing, near rail is part of Stapleton. And, you know, that's through an agreement that we have with Forest City and work that was done by colleagues that I served with back before term limits went into effect.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm satisfied with the information tonight and don't plan to call it out.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Or take them. Okay. This concludes all the items and needs to be called out. We're now ready for the block. Votes on resolutions and bills for funding consideration council members. This is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Otherwise it's your last opportunity to call on an item for supper vote. Councilman Herndon, would you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on final consideration? Final passage on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, Mr. President. I move that the resolutions be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And bills on final consideration be placed upon final consideration do pass in a block for the following.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Items all 2018 unless I say otherwise. 38, 39, 41, 49, 50, 24, 4052, 1144, 45, 42, 46, 48, 57, 27, 28.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is it. All right. Madam Secretary, do you concur?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. It's been moved and seconded. Madam Secretary.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Raquel Black, clerk. ALL Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. I earned. I can eat. Lopez. All right. New Ortega I sesan II. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am pleased to announce the results. 1212. As resolutions have been adopted, the bills have been placed for final consideration and do pass. Since there are no public hearings this evening, there are no objections by members of council will not take a recess.'"
