        "'speaker_8': 'You know, the Broncos very recently had supported one of our efforts at Pako Sanchez Park to really re-envision the park and really activate it. And what they did is they said to get people out to the community, we're going to offer a raffle and two tickets to the Broncos game.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And lo and behold, there was a gentleman who came out from right there in the Westridge Homes right there in West Colfax Real Park neighborhood, Avondale area. He had lived in the shadows of the stadium his entire life and never been to a game.'",

If you don't get it, you think it's kind of one. You're wondering, what is this silliness, what city council wastes from their time with this proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If you do get it, then you understand the very many moments in your own life that the excitement of a Sunday or a Thursday night or a monday night has provided. And for me, when I heard who our guest was going to be to accept the proclamation, for me it was just like, Oh my.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And then you talk about Super Bowl memories. If you were to rank order your top ones, you would have in that list John Elway making that dove to get that first down against the Green Bay Packers. And so very excited about our team being extremely successful.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'You know, when I first got to Denver, 1969, we didn't win very much. And 77 was the first time the Broncos went to the Super Bowl. And I was a part of that. It was probably the most exciting time in my career as an athlete because no one expected the Broncos to be there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we got there. And now it's kind of like we expect to be there and win. Pebble is a unique individual, and I'm glad you brought his name up today, especially because he does have Alzheimer's. And when I first met him, he told me, This is Billy.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'And that's why, you know, we've been in this war eight years and. I just you know, I want to think that we're going to win this one for him. It would be tremendous because here's a guy that never wanted his name involved.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He would be the first one to say, it's not about me. It's about it's about the team and the coaches and the community. And so he's allowed me to do some things in the community with the alumni that that are incredible.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'He said, Whatever you need, we will we will get you because we want to be big in the community. We want we want to do everything we can. And I'm not a Boys and Girls Club. I'm kind of like one of the honorary members out there and a little person and one of the kids out there I'",
        "'speaker_9': 'kind of adopted. And he's a senior. So, you know, he's he's amazing a man. That's why I met him at the Boys and Girls Club and and gave him a hand. And now he's he's going to graduate. See you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm just. But Pablo made it. He is the Denver Broncos Boys and Girls Club. And that's the way he wanted it. And it's great. And like I said, we've been there eight times, which is remarkable. I see I see us winning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I see. I feel a vibe with this team. We're underdogs going in and I kind of like that. So we won't go in cocky. And this team that we're going to play is going to be a tough team to beat, but I think United and orange.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think that we can do it and I'm excited and I thank you for this proclamation, and I know everybody in the office will accept it. We're getting out of Dodge on Thursday and it's going to be exciting.'",

I believe that City Council has an obligation to ensure that the omnibus bill aligns with the findings and the recommendations of the HRA.

        "'speaker_7': 'And. To safeguard the health and the quality of life and the business vitality in the GSE neighborhoods. So I would request that you please take into consideration what our recommendations are and any more that you might make to strengthen the community input in the omnibus bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have an Elizabeth.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Hi, folks. I appreciate that. Broncos resolution and Elizabeth P.O. Box 16545 in Globeville 80216. But it says Denver. I do have a business that I'm happy to eventually let people know about in Globeville, and I'm still being passed from person to person as I get a permanent home back in my neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to speak in support of the effort and suggest a couple specifics. On page six, the results of investigation, decision and director. It is Strike MP, page six in item C one. The striking not less than five days prior to the date of hearing the director shall make known.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's striking that not less than five days prior to during the initial marijuana hearings of recreational hearings, I myself attended hearings where people had not or applicants had not met. The requirements for applying for licensing and the hearing essentially shouldn't have happened.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I'm not quite sure why that was stricken, because I think it was it's something that would support excise and licensing to have advance notice. So my apologies if I misread it, but it just seems like a housekeeping thing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'In support of what Nancy was just saying on page seven, the reasonable requirements of the neighborhoods and the. The desires of the adult inhabitants, as evidenced by. And then there's a list of things like petitions. I would request that you add approved area or neighborhood plans and regional masterplan such as national western with the list where you'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Last speaker, Mike Elliott.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, councilmembers, for this opportunity. My name is Mike Elliott's. I'm the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group. We primarily want to thank the people working with the city because it's been a really you all have a really great team put together.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of intelligent people working.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On these audiences. We had a number of issues going into this that we managed to get a lot of them solved and a lot of them addressed through just open communication and working through a lot of items. So we do have one final concern, though, that it's our understanding it's going to be addressed through rulemaking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I did want to highlight it just to throw it out. There is still something we've been worried about and it gets back to the public comment I made at the committee hearing, which was the current language in this proposed ordinance, would say that any transfer of ownership would be stopped for any disciplinary action.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And our question was, well, how far does this go with any disciplinary action? Could it be something as minor as just having a camera pointed in the wrong direction? And after speaking with folks in the city attorney's office and the mayor's office and Stacey Loucks, of course, we're under the pressure now that this is really intended for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the more egregious violations. And and so this is apparently going to be addressed in rulemaking, and we will be satisfied with that having it be addressed there. But this is just one of those issues that we just wanted to see how far that language would go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So wanted to put it on the record. But we definitely want to thank Stacey, Ashley, Marlee and all the folks of the city because they've been great to work with. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions from members of the council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Stacey, can you come to the microphone, please? And then Malia may have a I am an attorney question legal question for you, Stacey. Can you talk about one of the speakers discussed the public hearing process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so for that specific bill are around IMAX zones, industrial use zones. Can you talk about the public hearing process and why you all decided to change it? The challenge that we're facing over here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Exactly. So in the proposed bill that you're looking at today, there's actually three kind of references to public hearings. The first one is that we're adding a requirement for needs and desires for medical centers. That's we've never traditionally done any sort of public hearing in order to open a medical center.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So for right now, under the moratorium, that'll be for transfers of locations. So we now are adding the first public hearing requirement for medical centers. We're also codifying an existing practice, which is that we do do public hearings for transfer as a location for retail centers, but that's not an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's something that we're putting in the proposal before you amphitheater requirement is what Councilman Brooks is referring to right now in the code. If you are in a grandfathered grow location, if you're in an impact zone district, there is annual public hearing requirements to look at whether or not it's frustrating the comprehensive plan or violating kind'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of some of these have safety welfare aspects in the last year and some are that we've been conducting these public hearings. We've held over 100 public hearings and we've only had one resident show up. So what we're proposing is, is that tool, it's very valuable and I think will absolutely address concerns as growth happens, particularly in some'",
        "'speaker_7': 'neighborhoods where the neighborhood plans and the comprehensive plans are being traded. So we're asking that there's an absolute minimum threshold, ten signatures, then we'll hold the public hearings. But having 100 public hearings has been a significant resource challenge for our department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We think it's actually caused a lot of fatigue for registered neighborhood organizations, for people that are getting constant notifications, maybe about one location has multiple licenses, and these are getting multiple notifications. It's also there's a lot of resources for a city attorney's office, for a hearing, officers to have 100 public hearings where no one has showed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So our proposal is, again, not is to keep that tool, to keep the public hearing, but to have that ten signature threshold grant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And my next question is just we had another speaker talk about the five days and striking the five days. I don't know if you or Marley want to address that, but can you can you talk about why you put the five day, why you struck the five day?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Councilman. I think that might have been an earlier version of the bill. We've added that back in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Done.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I was actually going to ask some of the same questions just to clarify for the global civic partners. I read your letter very carefully today, and I believe that what Stacey just clarified actually addresses some of your bullet points about the hearings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, man. Man, we're gonna need you to come to the microphone. Can you feel free to come on? I just need you to speak for the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Out of the 100 hearings, I don't know how many were were held for Globeville, Elyria, Swansea. Hear the word on the ground and in the communities has been there have not been public hearings and notifications in Globeville, Elyria, Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think it has something to do with the idea in IBI which that zoning which is used by right as I understand, and learning all these things. So it's so we're not afforded those public hearings that were part of the IMX.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm learning. I mean that's that that's my under. That was my understanding. So Globeville Elyria, Swansea does does present a unique situation that may not be in other areas of the city that have a lot of marijuana places, marijuana businesses and especially the cultivations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is huge.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, one improvement that will hopefully impact your community is that this bill is now going to require a needs and desires hearing for both medical and retail. And so in the future, if a medical or retail facility wanted to go into the neighborhood, there would be a needs and desire hearing, correct?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes. And that the community would have input on that. So moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But there's there's nothing. I may be mistaken. You know, I tried to read that bill spent many hours that there's nothing for public hearings for the renewals which were those weren't those 100 public hearings about license renewals. I mean, I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that I mean so that so that's one thing that we're really concerned about is renewals, businesses that have violations that we know about that. Thank you very much. There is one. I am zone district north zone grow license north of I-70.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nancy's correct. Most of the growers and north of I-70 are used by rights and I zone districts in terms of renewal hearings. Actually, one of the elements that's in the recommended, if the 24 recommended changes that we're bringing for you today is to give that director of excise and licenses the ability to call for a renewal hearing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for exactly just what that's and that's not an authority that I have currently, but that's one that we're being asked for in this new bill.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Black, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't know if there's anybody here from maybe CPD that can answer this question, but that whole discussion that just transpired there, you know, back when the zoning code was adopted in 2010, that predated much of what we're seeing now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would like to know what specific uses were in the use table that allows this as a use by. Right. In both a retail and a plant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Husbandry Council member actually had an answer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I don't have an answer specifically for that, but this is a big issue that we said we want it to be taken care of in in actually marijuana committee and on February 8th. And so CPD hopefully that day, if they're ready, is going to present everything to us and dealing with all the uses before 2010 and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some of the issues that we're facing now so that we can make some policy decisions on where to go from here. Yeah. And so to that end, I actually think the zoning is potentially a better tool. It comes it comes back to us on what we what we do to rule on a rulemaking side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So then my other two questions particular to to this. Is. What was the. Well. It's confusing about this renewal hearing is that all renewals are the nonconforming ones that require ten signatures. I mean, ten signatures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Exactly. That is just for the non-conforming for the for the growers that are licensed and non-conforming zone districts which are typically IMAX zone districts. So if if neighborhood plans are adopted in some traditionally industrial areas, then become mixed use areas, those locations would then be grandfathered and also subject to these hearings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a distance requirement or is it just any ten people?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right now, we've we're are aligning it with liquor that you have to be ten people within the designated area. I believe the designated area is five blocks north, five or an R.A. that touches and overlaps within the designated area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So any member of the R.A..'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The R.A. body itself. Okay. So I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then to that end, right now, it's an automatic renewal hearing. How can we ensure that neighborhoods continue to receive some sort of notification on these types of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Great question. We have a three part strategy. The first one is we'll put it on our website. All the renewal dates for all of the. Grows in the IMAX zone districts. Our intention is also to notify other council members who have these grows in your districts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the third piece we're looking at is the technological solution. If we can just send out an automatic email to the impacted areas, that one, we just have a little bit of trickery and we're working with technology services and kind of need to maintain a little bit of flexibility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So our two point strategy is to work with your offices and to have all the information available on our website.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Previously it was an automatic hearing. Now it's any time, right? It's or is it some window?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a 90 day window before the renewal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there a way to extend that if per request or something like that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we wanted to extend that window for the neighbors to be able to collect signatures. Yeah. It's no. Yeah, I might have to. We'll have to think about that. I think that idea is that it's 90 days before the renewal date.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So he's thinking like more 120 days before the renewal date that the neighbors could submit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, it really I would much rather and I'm sorry I didn't think of this before, but I would much rather say any time after the renewal, you know, because what's going to trigger somebody to even inquire about that is an incident and a problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you can't time that in a 90 day window. And so if you start to have an operator that starts to go south, you would like to be able to sort of fire off a hearing if it's a community gets the ten signatures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. So. So the bill has a couple has a lot of different elements. So with the Imac's grow facilities themselves, it's 90 days before the facility. Now those facilities have violations. One of the things that we're asking for in the bill is to give the director immediate summary suspension authority and to do renewal hearings for any of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the thousand licenses, not just grow licenses, not just grow licenses and Emacs districts. So we feel that would be an effective tool as well for if there are incidents, if there are complaints, if there is that trigger, that we can hold a renewal hearing for any of our thousand licenses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. And then the last one, what's the rationale behind the transfer? I'm trying to figure out my own writing between the rationale behind the sort of loosening up of the transfer constraints, uh, for lack of a better term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is that another alignment with the state or what is that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is that the speaker the before we are really trying to tether the local and state licenses. There have been times that we've gotten out of sync with somebody supplied at the state for a transfer of ownership or transfer vocation, but didn't necessarily come in in a limited amount of time and apply with us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're trying to synchronize as much as possible, and especially if you're under significant disciplinary action at the state, if you're under a show cause of the state because of a major violation, we want to be able to have protections that you can't come in and transfer ownership into somebody else's name at the local level.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to make sure that we have the same ownership on licenses at the same time with the state.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Stacey, if you could stay there for a minute. So first of all, I want to ask how. The complaints play a role in addressing odor or disposal of product. Not following the the rules of other types of complaints.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So help me understand if that applies the same to all or just certain licenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We track complaints on every license, so every license has to go through a number of annual inspections and compliance investigations. We also track complaints through 311 through the Denver Police Department, through the State MPD. So all that is tracked on the individual licenses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we are able to see if any particular licensee or business is starting to accumulate complaints, then we can take the appropriate action. But we track everything and we have a pretty good data gathering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So with the changes in this omnibus bill. That will give you the authority to call a renewal hearing. That can happen anywhere, regardless of the HIV issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are no hearings for any license renewal.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. That's that's good to know. And the complaints all have to have at least ten signatures.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now, that is just to hold a public hearing for the I am ex the non-conforming gross. Whether or not that's the issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are ongoing issues with some of those things that we just talked about in terms of complaints being lodged with exercising license. That can be enough to call a show cause hearing or a renewal hearing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. We can hold a show cause any time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. I think that's good to know. So I'd like to know that for any of those that came in after we adopted the regulatory framework for recreational. I attended most of those meetings, paid close attention, and thought we were doing a moratorium on everything.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when I realized that medical establishments were still being able to get their licenses and I saw the numbers and how they had grown, it just shocked me. So I just have to share that. But. For any of those that may still be in the pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'How does the fact that a community any and we're doing more and more these tied to our neighborhood plans that have health impact assessments how does that health impact assessment get factored in when you are issuing licenses? Is there some kind of overlap communication that happens and if it's not happening, we need to rectify that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That ensures that you all get to look at those recommendations and those concerns from those neighborhoods, many of which already have serious other issues, which is why they're trying to do these in the neighborhoods with their neighborhood plans.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the most direct way to consider impact studies and stuff like this. If it's about to attention during the public hearing, then that's can be something for contemplation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But if you're in a neighborhood that doesn't get a public hearing because your zoning is used by. Right. Zoning, that's a problem. So we need to correct that. And I know that's something we'll be talking about at our February meeting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that's what I was just trying to kind of underline here. So. Okay, that's that's helpful. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Stacey, I have a question for you. So when an applicant submits a completed application on that application, do they need to specify if they are going to move into a preexisting building, if they're going to, you know, do construction or if it's a brand new build?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And are those treated any differently?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They specify with the planning department. So you go to the planning department to get your zone use permit initially, and then you come to our department to actually apply. And that kind of once you apply, that kind of saves that location as you go through the application and inspections process.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So zoning looks at that initially. If it's a new location, as long as it has an address, we're able to accept the application. We don't treat it differently if it's preexisting. It has the same expectations for inspections, certificate of occupancy and has to meet all the same building code standards, whether it's a new build or whether it's'",
        "'speaker_7': 'an existing building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, counselor. I'm sorry. Was that all you had, Councilman Gilmore?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Any other questions? 912. Scene. None public hearing is now closed. Time for comments. Calvin Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Stacie Marley and the whole team for putting this together. This was those 24 adjustments that were making administrative adjustments. But as we had this in the Business Development Committee, it was quite clear that they were, you know, microcosm of some bigger issues that we need to address.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it just kept coming up. And so I want to thank all the folks who who testified today. Your words are not lost on us. We are we're working diligently to make sure that we're trying to get the right balance here, because it is clear in certain neighborhoods we are out of balance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, some of our neighborhoods that are in transition, some of our neighborhoods that have been historically industrial, that are right next to a school, right next to a residential location, we didn't think about that when we talk about zoning and some of it got passed, all of us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so we really want to address those those issues. So, you know, and I think in the neighborhoods I represent, the IMX, there are IMX zoning locations there, but it's more I-and I be in An and B locations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even though we can trigger a public hearing, there's no notification, there's no distance between schools and residential neighborhoods. And it's a it's a serious issue that we need to address. So excited that we will have a hearing conversation about this with CPD.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'CPD will give us a lay of the land in our marijuana task force or committee of the whole that we have. And we can begin to talk about how we might address some of these issues. So thanks, everybody, for moving this forward.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I am fully on board with supporting this. This came through committee. We we had a lot of conversation about it. And some of the changes that I think we do want to make may may have to wait until another conversation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to have a clarification for the viewing public. I think people in my district in particular are going to be pleased with the fact that in the future we're going to have a needs and desire hearings for both medical and retail, and it will be more similar to the way liquor license'",
        "'speaker_11': 'are issued. But that said, under our current moratorium, no one is applying for retail or medical licenses except for testing facilities. Thank you, Nathan, for pointing that out to me. But also in the coming months, I know you all have brought forth a lot of issues.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'David Roybal One of those issues is concentration of a lot of facilities in the same neighborhoods, and we are all meeting, you know, over these coming months to discuss a lot of the issues that you're bringing up. And we want to address them and we hear what you're saying.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we'll talk about zoning and location of ground facilities. We'll talk about zoning odors and again, the concentration in certain areas. So we are listening to you. And I think the bill that that we all look into is a complement to this, what they're doing from excise and licenses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, Councilwoman Black just gave my speech, actually. Thank you for making those comments. First, I want to thank everybody, including the industry, who participated with our excise and licensed team in shaping this. And I know this would not we wouldn't have as few people as we have here tonight, even with the weather.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Had we not done that, this room would still be full. So I appreciate all of those efforts. And, you know, there are some things that we still need to work on. My hope is that we can do that within this timeframe before we make a decision on whether or not we extend a moratorium, whether I want to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'make sure we have a conversation about whether or not we cap the number that we have in this city because, you know, no place else has the same number of establishments that we have in Denver. And, you know, we thought we were capping them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought we were capping them when we brought forward the last group of regulatory bills on the recreational marijuana. But so I think this will be part of the deliberations that we will go through, ensuring that we deal with the issues that have been brought to our attention at the public hearings around.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, odor and crime in some cases is is a big issue for communities that are next to some of these facilities. So I just want to encourage the ongoing participation from both residential communities as well as the industry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thanks for for all the work that you all have brought forward. I think these are good changes and it will help, you know, ensure that we're doing a better job dealing with some of the issues that have been brought forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I know that because it is such a new industry and we've sort of been the lead city trying to shape this as we go along. You mentioned earlier that they got police next to schools. Well, what we know is when the state legislation passed, some of these places just started opening before we got a chance to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'deal with any of the regulations, including the state. And so that's why we have a number of nonconforming uses in various locations. And, you know, it's been it's been a lot of fast and hard and important work that's been done by the city as a whole.'",
