In regard to criteria one, there are three adopted plans that apply to the requested rezoning, including the Comprehensive Plan Blueprint, Denver and the University Park Neighborhood Plan.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'As mentioned previously, a rezoning TSD one is consistent with blueprints under guidance as the subject property is on the boundary of two neighborhood contexts. In this case, the urban edge zone district is more appropriate than a suburban zone district, as it maintains the neighborhood's desire to prohibit the suburban house building form.'",

I do believe this application meets the criteria, but I really appreciated your bringing up the legislative reasoning that we passed a year or so ago because it puts kind of a wrinkle into this situation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know what the rezoning did previously this the areas allowed both suburban and urban house forms for the for the uninformed.

More specifically, it's located within the Harkness Heights portion of Berkeley.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The apples are. The property is located on Hooker Street between 41st and 42nd Avenues. It's approximately 6250 square feet and is occupied by a single unit home. The property is currently in the urban single unit C Zone District and the applicant is proposing to rezone to a district that allows for an ADU USC C one.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As stated previously, the existing zone district is urban, urban single unit C, which allows the Urban House primary building form and typically has a minimum zone lot size of 5500 square feet. And all the other properties within the Harkness Heights that are residential are also zoned to us, you see.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The current use is single unit residential. Most of the surrounding area and within Harkness Heights is also a single unit. There are a small number of two unit and motel unit in the area, however. This slide shows the existing form and scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The upper right hand side is the existing home, and then the left are other single unit uses on the block. And as you can see, this particular block is all single unit uses. This MAP amendment was complete in the beginning of October.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A postcard notifying property owners within 200 feet of the site was sent out on October six. To date, we have received six comments. Five are opposed to the proposed rezoning, citing concerns with parking, affordability and infrastructure capacity. And we did receive one comment that was in support of the request.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then additionally we received a comment from the Berkeley Radius United Neighbors. R.A., along with Harkness Heights Neighborhood Association, sent a survey to neighboring property owners, and they received feedback that eight property owners were in support of the request and then 13 were were opposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Arnaud's are unable to release information on why the property owners were either supportive or oppose and because they did not do a permission to release comments in the survey. And so I don't quite have that information. But a member of the Brun Zoning and Planning Committee said that there were concerns over the current configuration of the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'buildings on the site and then in the parking. The Denver zoning code has five review criteria which must be met for approval, and I'll go through each one. So the first is consistency with adopted plans, of which there are two that are applicable to this site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The first is comprehensive plan 2040. And so for this one, there are two strategies that are applicable. First, this rezoning will create a greater mix of housing options in the Berkeley, particularly the Harkness Heights area, for all individuals and families.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then second, it will promote infill development where there's already infrastructure, such as water and sewer in place. And in Blueprint Denver, the future neighborhood context is urban. These areas are characterized by one and two unit residential areas, with some mixed use and multi-unit embedded throughout.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'BLOCK patterns are regular, and there's a high degree of walkability. Blueprint identifies this property as a low residential place type is place types are mostly single and two unit uses and accessory dwelling units are appropriate and can be thoughtfully integrated in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Street type for Hooker is a with an undesignated local which is mostly characterized by residential uses, so their request is zoned district to you. As you see, one would be consistent with this low residential guidance and the future street type.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The growth area and blueprint. Denver is all other areas of the city. This is where we anticipate to see 10% of new jobs and 20% of new housing by 2040. Again, this is consistent with the rezoning to allow for an avenue because it will allow a limited amount of density that is consistent with the all other areas'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of the city growth strategy. Blueprint also identifies civic policy recommendations. The land use and built environment housing policy for states that individual rezonings to allow eighties are appropriate and should be small and area. And that's exactly what this rezoning is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's just a single property to allow for an you. That also finds the requested rezoning meets the next two criteria the rezoning will result. And and further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through its implementation of adopted plans and by providing a new housing type in a largely single unit area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Staff finds there's a justifying circumstance for this MAP amendment with the newly adopted guidance for Adams and throughout all Denver residential neighborhoods that's found in Blueprint Denver. And lastly, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context, the residential zoned district, general purpose and the specific intent of the USC see one zoned district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Therefore, based on the review criteria, staff recommends approval of rezoning. And that concludes my presentation and I know the applicants are also on AM if you'd like to ask them questions to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you very much, Libby, for the great presentation. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20 Dash 1477. We have three individuals signed up to speak this evening, and the first speaker is Christine Roe, who is the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I had. Please, Christine.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm connected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My name is Christine Roe, and we are requesting to resign our property at four men for four Hooker Street to allow us to renovate our existing two story garage. When we bought our house 20 years ago, one of the things that drove to it was this two story brick crutch in the back.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Although the structure was 100 years old.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It had electrical.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outdated water and a sewer connection. Research at the laboratory shows the first floor garages original and the second floor was addition was built about nine years ago and in 1921. We've always wanted update the structure and started looking into what it would take to legally fix it up a few years ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Our goal is to have an updated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Structure with an office in the apartment upstairs and a storage space downstairs. Our existing house, including a small edition completed 12 years ago that was permanent through the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Walls and four.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Floors under the required building lot coverage allowance. We do not intend to increase the footprint of our existing garage. During the planning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Board meeting, concerns about parking and traffic in our neighborhood. But rather I just want to note that our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'House has a driveway that easily accommodates two vehicles and that our block has an average of about 8 to 10 vehicles parked on the street during the night evenings. Currently, there's two houses under construction, so we have seen or are not under construction but are having additions and so we are seeing more construction vehicles parked in front'",
        "'speaker_3': '. But typically, I mean, I've been going out at night and just looking and you know, we averaged 8 to 10 cars out there every evening and we reached out to development services in early January and understand that if approved for an ADU, a next step would be to follow up with the city regarding all the design and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'code requirements for the existing structure. Again, we are requesting to design a property to allow an additional dwelling unit. Thanks for your time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And please ask any questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Christine. Our next speaker is Jesse Paris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. Members of council, those watching at home. My name is Jessica Sean Paris and I'm representing a Denver homeless out loud, black star action movies for self-defense, positive African-American for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Mile High Knowles, along with from allies to abolitionists.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I will be the next mayor of Denver for. 2020. Three. I'm in favor and so eloquently stated and meets all the five of my.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'See, Jesse, your Wi-Fi connection.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Just to see what adaptive plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We don't need you to turn your video off.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're not able to hear your audio and fortunately, Jesse. We might have to have you turn your video off so that we can get a better Wi-Fi connection with your audio.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you hear me now?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we can hear you better now. Oh. Okay. It looks like we might have lost. Jesse but we'll try to get him back in the queue. Or Jesse, if you want to go ahead and move, we'll try to get the rest of your testimony in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I was just saying that meets all five of the criteria, which is listing out the criteria. I think I left off on criteria three, which is, uh, further public health and safety and welfare justify circumstances, consistency with neighborhood contexts, residential zoned, district purpose and intense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So saying that this meets all five of the criteria, I'm going to be in favor of the rezoning tonight. The job of Mount Istanbul. I just wanted to know how many of these rezonings have been passed within the last year in District one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you can answer that question, I'll greatly appreciate it. Thank you and have a good night.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you, Jesse. Our last speaker is Tess Storti.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi there. Um. Hi. I just wanted to. Ask some questions about access to these public comments. And I know that, you know, the sign ups, the window is pretty short and tersely.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would ask that you speak directly to the bill that we're hearing tonight. It's 4144 Hooker Street. It's an Adu.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So if I. If I had wanted to sign up for. To comment on the edu regarding this rezoning, I'm just wondering how I would have done that if I had a disability. I'm a special ed teacher. And so I was just wondering how someone with a hearing or vision impairment would be able to have seen that'",
        "'speaker_5': '. City Planners PowerPoint because people that use visual overlays for seeing screens can't see shared screens. So access to the city planners presentation would have been impossible. So I'm just curious about access to some of these. And if I needed additional accommodations under the ADA, how I would have been able to get them in such a short amount'",
        "'speaker_5': 'of time, given that the signup was so short and connecting to services would likely take much longer than the 10 minutes or so that we have to sign up. So I just have some questions about access under the ADA.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. All right. Seen no questions from members of council. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 Dash 1477 is closed. Comments by Members of Council Councilwoman Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. So. Harkness Heights is a very unique area in northwest Denver, and it's gone under a little bit of a different planning process. In a few weeks, you will see me bring a conservation overlay for this area that we have been working on for about two predates me so effective Bernice's time so probably for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'about five years so that there is more outreach to this particular accessory dwelling unit than the last A.D. that you saw, which they're both in the statistical neighborhood of Berkeley. But Harkness Heights is its own R.A. within an R.A. And so due to that fact, they have had some more robust outreach, actually, that conservation overlay for $300'",

So I'm familiar with this site and I know that Adus, as we all know, are somewhat controversial in some parts of the neighborhood. And Harkness Heights has worked really hard on this overlay, and we did not create standards for an overlay within this, that we did not create standards for'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the ADOS and the overlay. So there's some conversations moving forward that we are going to probably have to go back on. But given that we are voting on this criteria, I just wanted you all to have the back story of why there was a little bit more robust outreach on this application prior to the one that we'",
        "'speaker_5': 'heard at the beginning of the night. I do believe it meets the standards and all five of them, and I do think that they are going to do a good job of doing adaptive reuse and adding any type of gentle density into our neighborhood is always a good thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to answer your question, Jesse, I don't know the exact number of accessory dwelling units that were voted on in 2020. I led an application for Chaffee Park so I can get that. If you want to email my office, I can have some research done for my staff.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Naomi I have no problem helping you find out that information. I just don't know what off the top of my head, but I just wanted to enter that question for everybody. And with that, I would ask my colleagues to support you for your support on this application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Sandoval, and happy to support this one as well because it meets the review criteria and seen no other comments by members of council. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
