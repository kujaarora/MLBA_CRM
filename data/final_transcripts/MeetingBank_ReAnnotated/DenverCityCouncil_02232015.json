        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. And I just want to apologize for being late. I just drove in from the Western Slope. So in 1995, I was the president and city council when we had the first flight that came into DIA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was snowing like crazy. And we had. Multiple flights coming in. Where? In the previous airport at Stapleton. In that kind of weather, we would not have been able to have two planes land side by side. And I don't know how many of you remember flying in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there would be a plane next to you and you could literally wave to people in the you know, as their plane was going by, you were that close to each other. So that safety issue is one that was corrected by building the air and ensuring that not only we have a safe airport, but we have the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ability and the capacity to have 12 runways if we ever need them in the future. Which is incredible because it could be the world's largest airport. And with the 53 square miles that DIA has, the opportunities not just for Denver and not just for the communities that surround it, for the whole front range, has benefited tremendously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't know how many of you drive through Aurora, but it's amazing how many industrial businesses there are along the I-70 corridor that benefit from their close proximity to DIA. So I just want to say happy birthday, DIA, happy 20th birthday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And to the team of managers who helped ensure that this runs efficiently and continues to be the economic engine that it was envisioned to be. I want to say congratulations and thank you for the work that you do every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just want to say a special thanks to my colleagues who served at that time, who helped go out and knock on doors to ensure that this issue was put on the ballot in Denver and and in Adams County to ensure that we were successful in Annex and into Denver and being able to move forward with it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'as it had been envisioned. So thank you for bringing this forward and please add my name. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Next up is Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Madam President, I wanted to also chime in and say happy birthday to DIA. I remember the first time seeing DIA with my own eyes and I was as a young guy when those of us that remember Stabler, Stapleton, remember that all you had to do was get on to Quebec.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Stapleton was kind of it was your average airport. It really wasn't intriguing to the I knew where it was. I think the only time I had been there was a kid when we walked in the Broncos home from there in their first championship and or their first AFC championship in 1986, when we seen the open the scene'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that first plane come in and being able to see it with your own eyes is the most magnificent airport I think anybody had ever built. And it still is. To this day, I have had the privilege to see other airports around the world, around the country.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I tell you, there is nothing like Denver International Airport. It is completely unique. It does even it feels like you're walking into a I don't know what, but it's it's it's beautiful, spacious, it's clean, you know, it's user friendly and it's just amazing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, you're always in are and speaking of are. There's just something about the architecture with that airport and something about looking at that canopy and seeing the snow, the snow peek mountains at it that it represents. And then there's the most incredible picture.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I thought if they could not get even more magnificent. Somebody stole my idea. And I one of these days, I was just like, I got to get out there during a thunderstorm. They had the blue Mustang in the middle of a thunderstorm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the air captured this fear. I know who the photographer is, the captain that captured the picture of the blue Mustang with the in the background and with this lightning bolt and thunder cloud. Right. And I thought to myself, if there was a new definition of the word mystique, that is it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if I and I attribute both of the Broncos two Super Bowl wins to that, I love Bucky the Bronco. But man, that Mustang is awesome. And any team that comes in and sees that, that's got to shake you up a little bit when it's at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a beautiful airport, but the thing that makes it the best night, I'm glad some folks chained up the chain chimed in on this is their employees. It's the concessionaires, it's the parking attendants. It's the folks that greet you in the beginning to ask if you need help with your luggage.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's guest relations. It's everybody who makes that airport. It's the janitors who keep that airport clean. Those of you have seen other airports around around the country. They are not as clean as DIA. And it's just I know there's a good crew there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's great folks that are that are from management all the way down to the folks that that are the tarmac rats that are out there, you know, working on a daily basis. It is an amazing, amazing facility. Every time you come with a new idea, it's hard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's hard to top the next one. So happy birthday, DIA. And to here's to many more. And one day, hopefully it'll be the spaceport and add more to the rumors. Right. So anyway, thank you. Happy birthday.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, I thought you were going to say you felt like you're in an episode of The Jetsons or something. You.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No, but if there was an X-Wing, Star Wars X-Wing that landed, that that would be awesome. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilman Shepard.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I actually just want to ask Madam Secretary to add my name to the record as a sponsor. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You next is Councilwoman Robb, followed by Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just am going to be very brief and say that DIA is the most spectacular airport I've ever, ever seen. And I'm always so proud. When I come back to Denver, it feels like home when I walk in there and see the great art and experience such pride in my city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, thank you, Madam President. We have had six speakers and I want to talk. Thank Councilwoman Ortega for talking about the past, because so far no one has used the B-word baggage. But I think I mean, this whole thing, my goodness.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With me opinion, does he deserve a lot of credit or what? Because did he come under a lot of pressure, personal attacks? Is the name Gene a human being anything to you guys in his column in the Rocky Mountain News that he was frankly relentlessly attacking the CIA and the and the idea that we should move this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'airport hundreds of miles out of Denver. You know, we all drink from wells dug by others, and we need to credit my opinion and his vision. If you read Mayor Webb's book, he talks about. That the fact. As we've heard tonight, the dish opening on February the 28, 1995.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But it was supposed to open back in 1994. In fact, he mentions the DIA really opened three times, finally the only airport in the country to do that, the first two. It was not ready. And he says in his book, the mistake he made was to set once the first date didn't come through.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then he set another date. That was a mistake, he said. He should have just opened it when it was ready to open. But it really wasn't very happy back in 1994 as we celebrate this happy birthday. It was tough.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was a PR, a national PR disaster. Remember the photos of the luggage? You guys remember that? Yeah. But we did it. Someone might ask. Will we ever have another day like project? And I think we will. And I think for us, it was handed out tonight and it's called the National Western Center.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is our next big DIA light project, in my judgment. And it's coming. And fortunately, we have good leaders. One is sitting at a little elevator tonight above us that is heading up this huge project. But they're out there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Trailblazers. And we need them. And we should not forget them. So, happy birthday, DIA. Finally. Finally. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brown, are there other members that would like to speak? I just want to take a moment of personal privilege and just go back in the day with Councilman Ortega. Actually, I was Councilman Ortega as a council aide at the time, and I remember that the D.A., a baggage system that being severely criticized, there was'",
        "'speaker_2': 'even a conversation and a controversy about the terrazzo tile, which, you know, went on for days and days. And at that time, it was very difficult for some people to see the vision of what the future of DIA would look like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that it really helped set the tone for and position city of Denver in the United States. And I was so proud the first time that I was able to see it. It was just majestic and so beautiful with the with the roof along the roofline, along the mountains.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'll never forget that. And I just want to say that. To to Mayor Pena at the time, we were going through serious economic problems, and it was this big public works project that really helped to restore the public trust and the faith that our economy was going to turn around.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it did. And then the next project that came along that was a colossal lift was Denver Union Station. And that, as you can see, is also a national project. And now we're looking at linking through the East Line, Denver Union Station and DIA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm so, so proud to be able to look back and see that we've done large projects like this before. We have more coming before us. And all I can say is I was younger then. Not that that's going to stop right there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And but thank you so much. And happy birthday and many more. Madam Secretary, roll call Brooks Brown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can eat lemon high. Lopez I Nevitt I Ortega, I. Rob Shepherd. Sussman Hi, Madam President.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'So the SCC three x as a useless that is designed to be more accommodating of transitions to residential neighborhoods by limiting or prohibiting rather certain uses that can be offensive in those areas such as pawnshops and the like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As compared to the proposed zoning, the current PUD is based on the old B one zone district, which was a district that allowed residential and then office. And that's essentially the extent of commercial. There is very limited retail uses that are listed on your screen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Anything beyond those very specific retail uses would not be allowed under the current podium. There's a maximum square footage of 19,200 square feet, a maximum height of two stories. And otherwise, it followed the former Chapter 59 zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The new zoning, as compared to the old zoning, would expand the use list to allow retail uses and eating and drinking establishments, including drive thru facilities accessory to those uses. In the Denver zoning code, we regulate. We have a form based approach to the to the code.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we we regulate building form by height and setbacks and the like. So there is no maximum gross floor area. The maximum height would go to three stories and 45 feet, and all the other standards would follow the new code, the Denver zoning code, because there've been a lot of questions regarding the drive thru in particular, as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you'll note in the comments in your packets, I've added here a slide identifying what the drive thru limitations are. If a drive thru was to to be to be developed on the property under the new zoning, these are limitations similar to what would be allowed in the former Chapter 59 if drive thrus were allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That provides some screening and separation regarding the location of the drive thru in relationship to the surrounding properties. It also requires that vehicle access to drive thrus, not unreasonably interfere with automobile or pedestrian traffic and that queuing must be able to be accommodated on site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All of these are standards in the Denver zoning code that apply to all suburban commercial corridor districts and would apply regardless of the specific development provided here. But we provide that for context, just so you're aware what the actual standard is in terms of the public outreach process for zoning, the following registered neighborhood organizations were notified at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the time of application. We had four Virginia Vail Community Association, South Hilltop Neighborhood Association. Those two have commented on this application. And then there were two other neighborhood organizations who did not comment Inter Neighborhood Cooperation and Denver Neighborhood Association Incorporated after the time of application.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We've as I mentioned earlier, this has been in the process for a long time. As you all know, we have our no registration period, which has just recently been. Completed in a new R.A. registered at the time. So though they didn't receive notice of the application, they did receive notice of tonight's public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's the Virginia Vale Neighborhood Association in opposition to the request. We received comments from two neighborhood organizations, the Virginia Vail Community Association, which included a series of petitions in your packet opposing the application. And from the South Hilltop Neighborhood Association as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There were 26 additional emails from 14 people opposing the application. Generally speaking, the comments are concerned with the possibility of negative impacts due to the addition of the drive thru that I mentioned, as well as retail and restaurant uses as compared to the current use allowances in support of the application, the applicant provided a petition that he'",
        "'speaker_4': 'had collected 40 signatures from surrounding residents just to address some of the comments that have been raised regarding this application. They kind of generally fall in one of eight categories. One one issue that's frequently raised as regards whether traffic will be increased on residential streets.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We note CPD notes that traffic is not enforced in zoning, but the traffic code is enforced by the Denver Police Department, and Public Works will review an application at the time of development review for traffic impacts and any mitigation that might be required.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are concerns about the Access on Exposition Avenue. There's currently an already existing driveway from the mini storage site to Exposition Avenue, and this property has an easement that allows it to use that existing driveway access. Generally speaking, this is also not enforced in zoning and to the extent that access is reviewed, it is reviewed for fire'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and public works standards at the time of development review. Another concern has to do with students crossing. We still drive, which again is not addressed directly by zoning but is enforced by the Denver Police Department and then intersection.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Congestion has also been raised and as I mentioned earlier, public works reviews, applications at the time of development, submittal for any required mitigation. And it's and it's designed that way because although the zoning will allow a variety of uses and a variety of heights, the traffic standards that are apply are specific to a development.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the scale, the size and the type of use may have different impacts on traffic. And so public works are views that at the time of that development is proposed. There are a number of other issues generally relating to external impacts that were also raised, which we review generally do not be enforced in zoning, include littering, noise'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and loitering. A couple of the things that are enforced in zoning that are subject of some of the comments include lighting. We do have outdoor lighting standards that would apply in the Denver zoning code if this gets approved tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then the other has to do with late night hours of operation. The zoning code generally does speak to late night hours of operation. But in this case, because of the street that separates the site from a residential district, the rules that would occur would apply to an outdoor eating and drinking establishment likely would not apply.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Indoor activities are not generally enforced in zoning. 24 hour diners and the like are allowed in Denver's zoning code. Of course, other regulations that affect hours of operation include licensing and other things outside of zoning. CBD review the application against the five review criteria that are in the Denver zoning code, and I'll review each of these one'",
        "'speaker_4': 'at a time. There's further detail about each of these in the staff report packets you were provided with last week. The first is that a rezoning application must be consistent with adopted plans, and there are two adopted plans that apply to this property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The first is the city's citywide comprehensive plan 2000. And then the second is Blueprint Denver, the city's land use and transportation plan adopted in 2002. There is no specific neighborhood plan for this area. Comprehensive Plan 2000 has a number of strategies that apply directly to this kind of a rezoning, including a desire to promote infill development at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'locations where infrastructure and services are already in place to reduce sprawl. The land use strategies include offering opportunities for increased density, more amenities and broadening the variety of compatible uses which the rezoning to the commercial corridor district would increase the variety of uses allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mobility strategies include the promotion of mixed use development, which, as I mentioned, the new zone district would would allow a greater mix of uses. And then the economic activity goals relate to strengthening and where necessary, revitalize revitalizing Denver's commercial corridors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this rezoning would allow for development along the commercial corridor at this vacant site. Turning to Blueprint Denver Blueprint Denver has a land use concept designation of the site of commercial corridor. That's the red color on the map.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Commercial corridors are described in Blueprint Denver as being linear business districts that allow a variety of commercial uses oriented to an arterial street. It isn't an area of stability where the character is desired to be maintained while accommodating some new development and redefine.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Element and blueprint Denver and Lead Sale Drive is designated as a commercial arterial street, generally lined with commercial uses. Exposition Avenue is an undesignated local street, and so a commercial corridor, the suburban commercial corridor 3xa district will implement blueprint Denver's recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The commercial corridor aspect of the of the zoning is in direct alignment with the land use concept proposed in Blueprint Denver and and the stability and maintenance of character is maintained by choosing the three storey, the least intense commercial districts and specifically the three x, which has even less intense uses than our other commercial corridor districts in'",
        "'speaker_4': 'order to accommodate some new development. But being respectful of the character of the area. So having reviewed it for consistency with the adopted plans, we find the rezoning is consistent with both Plan 2000 and Blueprint Denver. We find also that the application, because it is to a standard zone district, has no impact on the uniformity of district'",
        "'speaker_4': 'regulations that apply to all properties in the suburban commercial corridor. Three ex district and to reason out of the old code and into the new code would further the public health, safety and welfare of the city. The justifying circumstance for this application is that the land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'degree that it's in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the change character of the area. As noted in the staff report, there's been a variety of development and reinvestment along the Lido Corridor, including the mini storage site just to the west.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Redevelopment of McDonald's just up the street from here, and a number of recent commercial tenant alteration and finish permits that have been issued along the corridor. In addition to general population growth in the central Denver region, as was pointed out, pointed out by the applicant in the application and documented by the census, which again are are all'",
        "'speaker_4': 'factors that lead to the understanding that other retail and neighborhood serving commercial uses would be desirable, would be useful in the area, and that recognizing those changes is appropriate. Finally, the fifth criterion is that the application must be consistent with the neighborhood context, the zoned district purpose and the intent, as this is a suburban neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that the suburban context is is is identified, as I mentioned, by the streets that are curved and where there's an incomplete grid, where property or buildings are set back from streets. And generally the SCC three exit zone district in particular applies to auto oriented arterial street corridors, where a building scale of 1 to 3 stories is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'desired with less intense uses than three. Here we find that the CC three zone district is a is a perfect fit for this. It's our lead style is an auto oriented arterial street. There is the desire for a lower building scale here than would otherwise be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the less intense uses again provide a good transition to the residential areas to the south and west. So having reviewed it against all five review criteria in the Denver zoning code, staff recommends approval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We have seven speakers signed up this evening. I'm going to read the first seven speakers when you hear your name, if you could make your way up to the bench here at the front so we can speed up the proceedings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The following are Paul Nafed Nafed, Phil, Mike Rudd, Holly Winter Hubbard, Bruce O'Donnell, Reuben Bread instead nial Smith, John Struts and Holly Struts. If you could make your way to the front.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Honorable councilman and councilwoman of the Denver City Council. I want to thank you for the opportunity to present this development proposal to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Could you tell us your name, please?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, my name is Paul Navratil and I live at 13 Tamari Drive in Littleton. First, I want to thank your Planning Department Representative Kyle Dalton for his presentation of the merits of this application. The zoning request is consistent with our plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and consistent with other commercial is own property to the east as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It recognizes that this is an infill property on a commercial corridor. However, I'd like to focus on the efforts that we have made to meet with and work with the community associations and address their concerns. In late 2013, we had two meetings with Virginia Vail Community Association, Paula Szeto, and a group of people that came to that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'meeting. And that resulted in a letter of support dated March the second, 2014, which you have a copy of in your packet going down the road when we've got the planning board the first time, it was roughly late August.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The property was posted. We had a call from Mr. Sturtz and he asked me to meet with him. I met with him and he had some questions which we talked about. And then he said he may have some other people that would like to meet with me and discuss questions and concerns.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I said, Fine, I'd love to do that. And the next day I got an email from Mr. Sturtz. It said, No one wants to meet with you, Paul, going down the road. I heard. I listened and I heard the concerns about the cut through traffic, through the neighborhood and the association.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Asked if the exit on the exposition could be closed and we at that their request, we went twice to the city planning department I'm sorry, the city transportation planning department and to the fire department one time was a concept plan review where they verbally said No.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Those two access points must remain open for public safety. But we went in formally in writing in in December, and Mindy Decker concluded in an email to me or actually to Mike read, that the vehicular access on dance position should remain open to the use of the general public and not be restricted.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I want to make sure that you get a copy of that because we specifically asked for that access to be cut closed off. The point is that no matter what's developed here, there's going to be two access points to that property.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that's the safety record.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'My time is up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Oh, you have six. Sorry, I just saw that. Please continue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the neighborhood's position for several months has been no no change to the zoning. All you have is 584 in December. Councilman Brown and Bob Golic met with Jon Stewart's and policy, though, in attempt to broker an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And as a result of that meeting, I agreed to make some concessions. Number one, no drive thru or drive up for fast food restaurant, no drive thru or drive up for any restaurant on site. So signage would be created to discourage traffic exiting onto exposition and encourage traffic on the leads.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Deal and speed bumps on the property would be put on the property to slow traffic exiting to exposition. There was a handshake deal which in my understanding, the association reneged on two days later. January 20th, there was another meeting with Virginia Veal Association, Paula SIEGEL.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And January 21st, I sent a letter to the association just reread, saying exactly what we would agreed to, and that I think you have a copy of as well. I asked you this before word to the association members, but I don't know what happened.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't believe it was. At the conclusion of this meeting, Virginia Vale redefined their position. No change in the zoning. Leave it as a weed or maybe a city park. So after that we did some direct canvasing in February just to see what the neighbors thought.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And in a couple or 3 hours on Saturday afternoon, we were able to get 40 people to sign our petition, and I'm sure you have copies of that. But I just want to just over the weekend, we received another letter of support, and I just want to give that to you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'A couple of weeks ago, Councilman Brown asked me if I would be willing to mediate with the neighborhoods. I said yes. And after several discussions with Steve Charbonneau, he felt the concessions I was agreeing to were significant. There was a tentative mediation meeting set for last Friday, which on Sturtz, Steve Charbonneau canceled a meeting because he felt'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the neighborhood stance was, This is all you're going to get. We'd passed your existing zoning, no change. So he even as late as yesterday, Steve Charbonneau called me and asked me if I'd be willing to mediate and meet today at noon.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I said, yes, I think Jon Stewart said yes. And he reneged on that meeting this morning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can conclude your comments. Your 6 minutes are up. Pardon me if you can conclude your comments. Your 6 minutes are up. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I'd like to conclude. You know, the building is appropriate for the corridor city plans. It's going to be an attractive, modern building. It'll be with uses that are neighborhood retail uses and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. The speaker is Mike Rudd.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. Oh.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Mr. Rudd, you have 3 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This will be short. Okay. I'm at. I'm the architect resi office at 88 low in East Hampton Avenue in Denver. I've been working on this property, the site with Paul and several other real estate brokers for a number of years.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've had a large extended stay motel on this site that then transformed itself into an even bigger building in the self-storage facility.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Most recently, we.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Had a.'",
        "'speaker_0': '19,000 square foot office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Building on the site, and during that time we'd had various.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Schemes for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'One story small buildings, a couple of detached buildings from each other. And I think that all the brokers and the real estate people have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Answered questions for and did site plans for believe that this site is not an office site, that it is better suited as a.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good infill retail site? It's not significant in size. And so I would hope that council can see an approval for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Rudd. Our next speaker is Holly Winter Huppert. Huppert. You got it right. Good job. Hi. My name is Holly Winter, also known as Holly Huppert.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I have many names for many different lives. Don't worry, I pay taxes under both names. I live at.'",
        "'speaker_2': '726 South Crime Area. I'm a homeowner there and I bought the house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Just about two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Years ago. And before I bought the house.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I checked that empty lot and I checked the zoning because I don't want to live in a commercial quarter. Lead sells a couple of blocks away, but you know, it's a couple blocks away.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I thought that was okay. And I checked the zoning very carefully and I saw eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Years ago the same developer had changed the zoning. So I thought.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm safe because I don't want to live in a commercial district. This proposed project is less than 100 feet from where I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Parked my car in front of my house. That's close.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't want to live in a commercial commercial zone. I hope you understand that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think you would either. The children play in the street. It's it's a neighborhood. It's not a commercial place. It's really important to me that I have a house that is quiet and safe. There is a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lot of traffic already that comes through onto our street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From the storage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unit that was put up a few years ago. I count one car every 2 minutes during rush hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So we keep all the children inside during that time. With more development on this property, it's going to be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Unsafe for our children. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Our next speaker is Bruce O'Donnell.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening, Madam Chair, and members of the Council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell. I reside in Denver, Colorado. My office address is 800 Glenarm Place, Suite 200. I'm here tonight to speak in favor of this rezoning application and to encourage your support of it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The staff report has pointed out it's consistent with the adopted plans, primarily comp plan 2000 and blueprint Denver. And it's also been demonstrated that it has consistency with the neighborhood context, description and also the zone district purposes blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Denver came up with a term when it was put into place in that term as commercial corridors, which I think is a key ingredient of tonight's discussion, because that then in turn informed our new zoning code. When we rezoning the entire city, we came up with a commercial corridor districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This application is for our C, C, three X, which is the suburban context commercial corridor. And as has been pointed out tonight by staff, lead steel is identified as a commercial arterial and so it's on a scale and similar and would expect land use patterns.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Similar to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Colfax.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Carter Boulevard, for example, which also both happen to be state highways, just like lead sales of state highway. They have limited access. The applicant pointed out that during his pre application conferences that he explored and wanted to see if he could limit access on exposition in the fire department required two points of access in and that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'links into the state highway issues. So this is very much a commercial corridor. It's also important to note that the applicant, I think, took the high road and attempted on numerous occasions to engage the neighbors in a transparent and sincere process, including agreeing to mediation multiple times and was stonewalled at every turn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think a good process has been conducted and this was also the appropriate zoning and the appropriate land use for a location like this. So the other thing that I think is important to think about in the staff report touched on this briefly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The proposed land use here is consistent with land uses nearby, right up and down this corridor. So, for example, neighbors of this property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Include.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A freestanding Starbucks with drive thru, a McDonald's with drive thru, a car wash and a car dealership. All auto intensive use appropriate for a commercial corridor. So consistent with the staff report in the unanimous approval of the planning board.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm testifying tonight in hopes that you will approve Ordinance 972.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rezoning the subject property to SCC.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Three x. It's an implementation step for Blueprint Denver and it also eliminates another remaining.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Artifact from the Chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Zoning Code. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That was perfect. 3 minutes. Reuben Bread instead, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, good evening. I'm Robin Gibb instead. 393 South A.V. St Denver, Colorado And I somewhat understand the position you're in, having been in similar in my own life. Great. Public trust is in your hands. Now there can be a lot of rules and regulations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Some good, some of them good, sometimes some of them good. Not good. Other times I also am president of the Homeowner Association South Hilltop Neighborhood, and I'm proud to be in that position and and took it because the people I talked to in my neighborhood felt that they couldn't talk to the city, felt that they were ignored'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all the time. Felt frustrated with that time. The current person. And I think we can empathize with that. Least I hope you can empathize because sympathy is not what we're asking for, is empathy. If you lived in this neighborhood immediately behind this proposal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You see that there is a public street? Oh, commercial corridor is on the other side. Lee still. The residents that are most affected immediately are behind it, behind exposition. Most of the petitioners against it live in that immediate area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's. Not a matter of how many signatures? 700 some homes. Most of them in the this side of the corridor don't live anywhere near the proposed project. Out of sight, out of mind. We've all heard that expression.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I'm here because I care. I care for South Hates Hilltop. We're affected by late. Still the school. We're affected by the density. We join with our neighbors in good faith. Hoping that you as persons. Elected to represent the best interests of the people.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We'll look at those who live within a hundred feet. Less than 100 feet. A couple hundred feet. See the traffic problems that are going to going to be there. But he says they're going to be there. Increased traffic in neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I appeal to you to consider the goodwill of the people that are most affected. In this matter and turn down the change in zoning. Eight years ago it was approved by the same developer that this is what it's going to be.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, now we see that was an untrustworthy statement and adventure by the developer. Thank you for your kindness and I pray for your hearts to be right because right is always right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, sir. Our next speaker is Niall Smith, followed by John Struts and Holly Struts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is Niall Smith, South Korea area, Denver, Colorado. I'd like to thank you for your time. First of all, Councilman Brown, I'd like to thank you for being at that police rally on Saturday. I noticed that you were one of the few from the council that was there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I would like to simply say that this rezoning. Had happened eight years ago prior to me purchasing my property on South Camarillo, and that the developer, to reiterate, made a promise to keep it at that. So simply a matter of maintaining a paid 584 versus an SCC three x would be something that would be beneficial for the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'neighborhood, the infill, the density, the amount of traffic being diverted down our city streets on an ongoing basis, the possibility of a drive through with lighting and traffic until at least midnight, I would think for a drive thru restaurant would be something that would be an annoyance to at least four or five streets within that area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you very much for your consideration and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Mr. John Struts about 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. My name is John Sturtz. I live at 710 South Korean Street. I'm considered the person who's riled everyone up over the change in the zoning request. I want to mention that City Council is not required to. Approve of every rezoning request that comes in front of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We ask the applicant to keep the zoning approved. 584 Because the agreement was made with the same gentleman, the same applicant eight years ago when it was formally. Designated as an hour to zone. And we conceded to APD 584, which would be less intensive, uses commercial type things.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We keep intermixing the two words in commercial and retail, but what the SCC three X would involve would be more retail and more traffic. In fact, the applicant did say that a traffic study that was conducted, he didn't indicate by whom, but a traffic study that was conducted indicated that one car per minute extra would be entering'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the property that would be entering the property at some point. I'm sure that car would exit the property. The trouble with this particular site is that most of the entry will more than likely be on in excuse me, from the stale drive on to the property at 6200 East Fleet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Still the exit back out on to lead stale would be near impossible. Almost everything on those along that corridor, which is State Highway 83, almost every one of the new properties that have been developed have a no left turn sign, which would essentially limit who can exit from the from the lead stale side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we're making the assumption I realize it's an assumption, but it's a logical one. And we're asking for just a little common sense in terms of looking at the site and looking at how are people going to exit back out onto lead steel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is a curb cut that's just going on to the cube smart part of the property. The applicant has asked that that easement be granted for his use. Also, in addition to Cube Smart and Cube Smart has signed off on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The trouble is there are accidents. There have been for within just the last two weeks on lead steel right in front of Cube Smart, as well as a hit and run behind Cube Smart two weeks ago. This is all documented in every block Internet site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The different accidents that have taken place. There were some major injuries just last week. I don't know how many people were actually hurt, but two ambulances and four police cars were out on lead. Still at the evening rush hour time lead still is an extremely busy street.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If any of you have driven down that street. The high school students during the school year have open campus at lunch hour. They migrate throughout the neighborhood. And once again, common sense. We don't have any studies that indicate that the high school students won't use the walk don't walk signs, but it's typically the case that they will'",
        "'speaker_3': 'take the shortest route if there is a attractive nuisance across the street, which we would consider a fast food restaurant. We're talking about fatalities, injuries, whatever. And I realize the zoning is saying we don't look at traffic. Traffic isn't our concern.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The police will take care of that. And we're supposed to wait until after the fact that this is built to address the issues of injuries and troubles with traffic on that location with just the one curb cut alone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are some problems with exiting. As I mentioned, there's a deceleration, if that's the proper word, lane, going into that curb, cut on leads still. But if someone were to take a right turn back out on to lead steel, there's no acceleration lane so there'd be quite some time involved in getting back out on to lead steel'",
        "'speaker_3': 'and once again common sense indicates they will exit onto exposition the drivers and by going down exposition they will cut through the neighborhood as they already do in order to shorten the route during rush hour. Oftentimes, cars are backed up all the way from Monaco to Holly Street at rush hour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The difficulty with that, once again, is safety. It's a Colorado State Highway 83. We cannot handle the noise, the loitering, the lighting, the hours of operation. We agreed to a 55, 84, and we're asking the applicant to please stick with what he agreed to and honor the commitment and our agreement with him eight years ago.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Holly Sturtz.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My name is Holly Brooks. I am at 710 South Graham Area Street. I also own property at 7765 South Court Maria Street. Our neighborhood association has pleaded with zoning to maintain the current plywood, which was hammered out over a year's worth of meetings with the current applicant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'When this applicant appeared before you the first time, you sent him back to zoning for an ever even broader usage designation. Our overwhelming concern, which we voted 92 five in our neighborhood, about the serious consequences of permitting a high traffic development on this site.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is a curb cut entering the property, but traffic is dangerously congested at most times of the day, so that the only obvious exit is the one established onto exposition and into our residential neighborhood. Even now, with only the quiet, low traffic business located at this site, frustrated drivers get backed up on this highway and cut through'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Earlier this very month, there was a hit and run accident at this same egress onto exposition. After hitting a young pedestrian, the driver sped off down my street. The addition of the high traffic business, which the applicant proposes, would increase this threat exponentially.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is probably your inclination to approve this plan and pass responsibility on to court or traffic. We've been warned by other unsuccessful neighborhood groups not to pin our hopes on traffic. Even if they are to rubber stamp this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They will fail to appreciate the dangers that a fast food restaurant located directly across from George Washington High School will pose to a man, the vice president of G.W., the school cop and the local officer at the scene of that hit and run had one response to the proposed plan a disaster.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The applicant has claimed that we have rejected his offers to append concessions to this zoning. You know as well as we do that all promises appended to SC c3x are empty and unenforceable. Please reconsider this rezoning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers question for members of council. Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just want to be sure. I think my first couple of questions are for Kyle. I want to be sure that I understand the changes in the sort of history on this site. I thought you had said that before eight years ago or before you d 584 the site was B1.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that right? Because I heard someone say ah two in the testimony.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That, you know, the, the current PWD is based on B1.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You two it was.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It was are two different are two.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I think so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And okay. And that's why there weren't drive thrus in the others because b one didn't have to. I do understand that. Right. And then a second question. If you look at the site where the storage facility is, whatever you think of storage facilities, at least there's a detached sidewalk in green grass and it's landscaped.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Looks pretty nice. Did the PWD require that detached sidewalk? I know we get right away and zoning, you know the sort of never the twain shall meet. But if this site were to be redeveloped, I'd like to see similar landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I don't recall those being specific provisions of the PD. I'm sure they must have been the public works right away standards when the property was developed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So do you think we can assume similar standards would be applied?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, that would be the public work standard on a street like this. You know, I know those are always subject to variances, but.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then let's see. I think I had another one. I guess my questions for Mr. Neff tell. But as you're coming up. So just a couple questions I didn't understand. Were you the applicant in owner for 85, 84?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. The the applicant and owner at the time was Channel six Television PBS's.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When it was risen to 584. But did you buy it from PBS?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We did.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And then my other question was, can you go back over what you and Bob Golic talked about with Councilman Brown and offered to the neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, I'd like to do that. And in reference to that. I have some notes that I'd like to give you, but basically. I mean, basically, the the I guess the tentative agreement was that we would not use the drive thru lane for fast food restaurants, nor would we use it for any restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We would develop site signage to take the traffic back on to Leeds Dale instead of onto exposition. And in fact we, we agreed that we would put speed bumps on at that exposition, which would slow down that cut through traffic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is a hard question because I realize you don't have any agreements at this point with the neighborhood for various reasons. But is that would that still be your intention in developing the site to put the speed bumps in and not have a drive through for a fast food restaurant and to have the exit signs?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, you know, we've we've tried and tried and tried to negotiate with the association and we've met with. No. All you get is page five.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Though, with no agreement with the association, you don't feel bound to those conditions that you just stated.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Don't. Okay. Got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. And I know I didn't make my point before, but I am respectfully requesting approval of this application. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. For my colleagues, some of you are able to see your names on the screens and some of you aren't. So here's what I have in front of me. I have Councilman Ortega, Councilman Kennish, Councilman Brown and Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Kyle, I don't see you. Would you mind coming up to the microphone, please? I've been perusing through the documents here, and I didn't see anything from G.W. High School. Is there anything in the record from the high school?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we we sent the referral of the both the initial application and the revised application to Denver Public Schools. And then we were copied on some correspondence with them. So we sent another email to them to invite them to comment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they received three different requests for comment and never provided comment directly to the city on this matter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we don't have anything in the record? That's correct. Okay. I would like to ask someone, how about Mr. Newfield, if you wouldn't mind, coming forward? Sorry. That's okay. I'll try to speak up. So can you. Can you tell us what you are planning to put on the site?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This should be. Can you talk to the microphone?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is the current plan we're working with and, you know, trying to say like this is very difficult because it's inefficient compared to a rectangular site. But we're planning to develop a single storey building. Roughly half of the density that's currently allowed on the property.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And it'll be a like what I would call a neighborhood retail service building that would have such things as maybe a sandwich shop, a hair salon, tanning salon, maybe a dry cleaner, sit down restaurant, those kinds of uses that would service the neighborhood and.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are the two access points, details of which position.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're going to have speed bumps here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To slow down the heavy duty trucks. The transfer traffic is already happening.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Because the people that cut through there, if this is backed up, are in fact in fact, they're headed over toward Monaco. And our plan is actually going to slow that down because of the speed bumps that that cut through traffic is going to happen no matter what.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So I'd like to ask a question about parking. What what are the parking requirements for what you're proposing? How many parking spaces are you required to have?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, this plan here shows an approximately 9000 square foot building. I, I believe the parking ratio is about one four, 200 square feet. And that would be enough to allow for maybe one or two restaurants a pizza place.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then these other services, general services, because the parking ratio for general retail is a lot less than it is for a restaurant. So we have plenty of parking to service that need.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to ask now about the traffic study that was done. Did the traffic study take into account the fact that there's a high school across the street? And I heard somebody speak to the fact that it has an open campus and there's concern about pedestrian safety of students crossing the street to to maybe buy their'",
        "'speaker_2': 'lunch at the restaurants that you just talked about.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. Okay. Thank you. That's several questions, but I'll try to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you can, speak into the microphone, if you're going to use that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It was clear that several questions, but I try to address them. This plan here shows George Washington High School. Can you all see this? George Washington High School in relation to the site, the city has provided a crosswalk and a light at this intersection and at the other end of the storage building where the power pools are'",
        "'speaker_10': '. So there's two ways for people to get across the street there safely. The other question I think you asked about was the trucks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So those are not there today or are they proposed as part of the development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Of those two lights and crosswalks are there today?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The other I think you asked another question about traffic and getting back on to leads.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nailed it. I was asking if the traffic study took into account the pedestrian safety and the potential volume of students that might be crossing the street to patronize any of the restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't believe it takes into that account. That into account. But we we haven't been requested do a traffic study by the development services. And if we are requested, we will do one. But I asked a traffic engineer to give me a rough estimate, and this is what he said, that he said the proposed near 9000 square'",
        "'speaker_10': 'foot development will generate foreign trips per day. When added to the many storage trips, the total site will generate 650 trips per day or 230 less trips than reported in the March 2000. Please still comments. Traffic Impact Study Specialty Retail Center includes a variety of uses such as restaurants, florists, real estate offices, etc. So I feel this'",
        "'speaker_10': 'is appropriate for your project to do that. Answer your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, it did. And I have one last question, if I may, Madam President. I know others have questions. My last question is about it's along the lines of what Councilwoman Robb had asked you earlier in terms of the concessions that you indicated you all were willing to agree to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I heard your answer to her question when she asked if that's something you are, in fact going to adhere to, even though there was not a clear agreement with the neighborhoods. And so my question is about the hours of operation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If there is a drive up window, I heard you say that there would be no drive thru as actually it's in the document you just passed out, no drive thru or drive ups for fast food restaurants, no drive thru or drive ups for any restaurants.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so. Is that, in fact, what you're committing to as part of this application tonight?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I've I've been trying in good faith to work something out with the associations. And I think you can see from what I said before that I basically been rejected. There was no effort made on their part to conclude mediation, which we even tried to do today.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If if the notes from the came from that meeting with Charlie Brown, Mr. Counselor Brown and Bob Golic basically said that I would agree to these things, provided that the neighborhood would support the application and not commence any legal issues afterward.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So it was a give and take type situation and I feel like I'm giving and they're taking. But when there's, you know, when there's no common agreement, where can you go?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So in terms of the issue of hours, of operation, of a drive thru, is that something that was ever discussed?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's never been discussed. And I would just whatever the city code is, I don't know, but we would comply with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. I have no further questions at this time. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilwoman Kennish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. Most of my questions were asked, but let's just close the loop on this one from Councilman Ortega Childs. You know the answer to the question, what are the hours of operation for? Generally for commercial and specifically for drive thru in this zone district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's no requirement generally for commercial on hours of operation. I believe the record there is a requirement of hours of operation for an outdoor eating and serving area. So if they had an outdoor patio relevant to a restaurant, if it's within 50 feet of the residential zone district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if they put it on the front side of the facing leads, they would probably be too far to be even subject to those. But there are limits on those hours of operation that I believe are I believe it's it's 10:00 Sunday through Thursday and 11:00 Friday and Saturday when they would have to close for an outdoor'",
        "'speaker_4': 'eating and serving area if it's close enough to the residential district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how about for a drive thru?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't believe their hours of operation for a drive thru.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. No further questions, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Counsel. McKinney. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam President. All ask more questions, please. Would you mind repeating the list? Possible tenants that you just mentioned a moment ago and do so very slowly. I think you've started with the what you threw out a potpourri of tenants and I think three or four or five.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Could you list those again, please? I'm going to write these down.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. The kinds of uses we envision would be a hair salon, maybe a Supercuts tanning salon, perhaps a dry cleaning operation, maybe a sandwich shop. Sit down restaurant. Maybe a pizza place. A flower shop. You know, those general kinds of retail type uses?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Wow. That's quite a variety and help build. How large would the building be that you say 9000 square feet approximately.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's very hard to get efficiency on a property right. Like this with.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, you're going to start building without any tenants or are you going to build to a specific tenant? What are your plans if this is approved?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. And we only envision maybe five or six businesses in the building. We don't see all those.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You so you can't, you know, have enough room.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. And I've, I've I'm working with a company called Waldoboro Scott who are talking to prospective users. And of course, we won't start construction until we have significant pre-leasing. No, that would be a requirement of financing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And like to get Kyle up here again because in the testimony, it seems like. That you the applicant. Was criticized for changing this from a PWD to more standard zoning. Would you explain what happened when it went to committee?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It went to committee last year as a p u d, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. A Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then and then the neighbors in planning committee expressed concern with it being a customized zoning and didn't think it met. The criteria for planning and development. Invited the applicant to come to the table and consider a standard zoned district and the applicant consented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So then the committee voted to direct the applicant to revise their application.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it was really it was my friends and colleagues on the committee that changed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I should note the committee did advise the applicant in our pre-application meeting at the very beginning that we would recommend a standard zoned district. But we also were recommending approval of the PD at the time it was found that met our criteria.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, there are a lot of fingers to be pointing here, but certainly the council had a role and that's why it went back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. With the applicant's consent. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And maybe someone, one of my colleagues, any of them might want to address that. The head of the committee might be helpful in doing that and I relinquish my time for others. I do have other questions, though.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown, for the intro there. Yes, but it did come to us as a paddock cow. I do have some questions for you. And when we ask and generally, we're trying to move to the new zoning and try not to reconstruct pads from the older zoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we asked what the reason for requesting a pad was, it was because the applicant wanted to make a less intense development there. Was that the reason why? And so we asked, wasn't there a way to move it into the new zoning and keep it less intense?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Do I have that right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, that's generally correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So we hit two birds with one stone. We maintain less intensity in the development and we're able to move it into the new zoning now by less intense. The original pod would have allowed what? That is more intense than what they have now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then what they have now under the current PD, I don't know that I would characterize anything less intense.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the couple had said it was less intense. The ex made it makes it less intense and less intense.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Than the SCC three without the ex which zone other zoning zoning found elsewhere along this corridor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Most of the zoning is three SCC or 83.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In some cases it's urban edge SCC three.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So that in the ex reduces what opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it prohibits some uses that would otherwise be allowed. So it's entirely on the use list. Generally prohibits pawnshops, firearms sales, those types of things.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, there's that. Okay. So it's not less, but it is one story building instead of what could be three. Right. Or the proposed building is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I believe the applicant said that they're proposing a one storey building. The zoning would allow a three storey building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. The other question that I have had was. One of the folks who talked to talked about their concern on trying to get on to lead stale, which if anybody lives there they know that's is a challenge although they do have turn lanes was there was the original pod.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Would it have allowed an office building? And this new zoning allows some retail, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct. Would the office the drivers to the office building have had a different kind of access and egress issues to light still than a retail customer?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Would the Pudi District site blend in, contemplate different driveways, if that's what you're asking. I mean, the physical access is in the same location as it currently.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is, right? So no matter who's driving there, they're going to have the difficulty of accessing on to it's not because it's retail that it makes it more difficult to get on and off a lead still, is it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, I think I think the comments generally are concerned with differences of volume and generation, that sort of thing. Of course, that's dependent on the square footage, the kind of, you know, restaurant that goes we all know, you know, the what's the what's the the drive thru chain in California, you know, that has the drive thrus around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the block. And then a Starbucks has peaks in the morning, but a pizza restaurant has peaks in the at dinner time. So it kind of depends on the nature of the use and and the size of the use, what the volumes would be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But in terms of the physical access and needing to get on the lead, still exposition, that doesn't change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That isn't changed by the new zoning. Okay. Thank you. I'd like to ask Mr. Neff, tell some questions. So in your conversations with Bob Golic and others and what the neighborhood had asked for, I did hear many neighbors speak about their concern about a drive up restaurant.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I see that you had started negotiating and the in this list and I know people have talked about it, but I want to make sure that we're clear about this. You had agreed to have no drive thru or drive ups for fast food restaurant routes and in fact no drive thru a drive ups for any restaurants'",
        "'speaker_1': 'signage on the site to discourage traffic exiting to exposition and speed bumps installed. Now, as you say, the neighborhood didn't want to negotiate further, but could if they had negotiated, would you have would you have written these down into part of the agreement so that it could have remained with the change in the zoning?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes, I would.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. It's moot now because the arrangements didn't occur. Right. I just wanted to know if you had been willing, because I saw that Mr. Golic had suggested that you actually write these down so that neighbors can feel a little more secure about the arrangements that would have been made.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, and it was my understanding that an agreement would be put together that everybody could sign and then become legally enforceable documents.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But when you approached the neighborhoods, was it the the neighborhoods? They did not want to sign it?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, at the meeting with Councilwoman Brown, Bob Golic, John Sturtz and policy, though, my understanding was that these things were discussed and the handshake agreement was made and two days later, the association withdrew from that agreement and. I see.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'That's where.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just wanted to make sure I understood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Incidentally, and I didn't answer this one quite correctly, but I would agree to limiting the use of the drive through to midnight, because I know I recognize that that's very important to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see. Okay. Thank you very much for the questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Kelly.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I was at that meeting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The public testimony is completed, so if you can have a seat. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Our next council member is Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Madam President, I do have a question, but I'd like to yield to Councilman Brown, because I think we're going on this point.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb. May I? Madam President, thank you. All right. Let's have the other side, if you will. Paul, do you want to come up arming and you guys want to come up and talk about what happened?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Smith. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for allowing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You bet. And we were both in the meeting. Both of you were in the meeting. I was there. And the late Bob Golic was there. Who was another neighborhood representative, I believe was their.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Policy, though? Yes, Mr. Hall.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was there. It's not here. Okay, he's not here. Okay. Various. Oh, hey, Paul. How are you? You're absolutely right. There was no handshake after our meeting. But I do believe on that Thursday when we met for nearly 2 hours in my office.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was trying to act like a facilitator and bring the parties together, and I requested that Mr. GARLICK contact his client and get his client to agree to no drive thrus. Because I understand that in the public hearing at the planning board that was the number one issue that really drove the opposition.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I thought we had made an agreement. We hadn't made progress. And then I get another email through the next day saying that it was rushed and we never got to the curb cut issue that you want. I'd like to hear your response to that, please.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Just part of the difficulty with that, as you know, was that the the meeting that was supposed to follow the agreement was, I believe, three days afterward. I think we met on the 12th and then the next meeting was the 15th of December.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And part of that stipulation, beyond what Mr. Gorelick recommended and nothing legally was written up that would be binding, we needed to talk about whether it would be tied to the deed. And so if the property ownership changed, it wouldn't affect us in any different way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We discussed that, and Mr. Golic essentially wrote up just a memo that we did make some we made some progress. And he would like to consider that. But he did some some other aspects of the memo included the fact that I was supposed to go around the entire neighborhood and get all of those 42 signature signatures on'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the list to agree to withdraw any opposition to the the agreement that was tentative. I said that I couldn't do that in three days, and that was my major opposition and the reason for the postponement at that time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Once again, there were no legal documents written up. And as Nigel said, there wasn't a handshake. I think you were met. I think you remember that we had to cut the meeting short because you got an emergency call and and you acted properly in terms of it being a quasi judicial, you didn't have any input into it'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So it was essentially you gave us the opportunity to talk in your office, which was great.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, do you want to like would you like to add anything? I would just.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like to say that none of the agreements that were possibly made were legally binding. So this gave Mr. Naftali the opportunity to renege on any agreements that were verbal due to the fact that we would have to go and have another fight afterwards if he decided.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To change his process. I'm moving on to the next attempt, if you will, to mediate this dispute. And that's when I contacted Community Mediation Concepts and my colleagues have a copy of the letter. What happened, why? I have you, Steve Charbonneau, for my 14 years on city council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And guess what? He's always succeeded in bringing hostile parties together. I can think of one incident where there was a a table between the two parties. One was on one side of the table and the other was on the other.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And it was the table represented, in my judgment, the DMZ. It was that hostile. What happened? Why could you not would not give up anything in this negotiations? And that's according to what Steve Charbonneau said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the difficulties with all of the mediation that was conducted was via email. There was no personal face to face meeting and once again, nothing was written up. And essentially the memo that Mr. Golic wrote had totally gotten out of the argument altogether.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And all that was being offered to us were speed bumps and perhaps a larger culvert for the water drainage from the property would maybe discourage traffic. But that once again was tentative and there wasn't anything legally written up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But once again, all the all the other agreements that Bob Golic wanted to talk about further were completely dropped as far as drive through and when it came to mediation. One thing that hasn't been mentioned at all is that this easement belongs to Cube Smart.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if you look at the memo closely, it says that the speed bumps would be put in with the approval of Cube Smart. According to the past president of the VCA, Deb Ward. Speed bumps were proposed when we had this same argument eight years ago about traffic and about high intensity, and we were told the speed bumps'",
        "'speaker_3': 'wouldn't do anything or they wouldn't be allowed because the fire department didn't want them. But once again, the the essence of this is that we were being offered speed bumps if Cube Smart approved. The second thing was signage to discourage through traffic.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know how many people really have noticed that. That the signage doesn't necessarily make any difference in terms of the the shortest distance between two points in the avoidance of of traffic jams.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, John. Thank you. Thank you. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brown, are there other questions from members of council? Councilwoman Kathryn Roberts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I just want to go back. I mean, ordinarily in Councilwoman Sussman tried to address this. Tonight we're deciding between the current zoning, in a sense, putting 584 in a new proposed zoning. It gets a little muddled because in between there was a PUD proposed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That sounds like it might have been preferable to the neighborhood. That was not the total impression I got in committee. So, Kyle, I want to ask you something else about that. In the party that came to committee. It was my recollection that a drive thru was also a use.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And there was other retail in that as well. What was missing and what was missing from it? It seems to me that it cut down on height the little bit, which from the three stories to one, that was sort of the distinction I heard when I thought, you know, there's not that much in it for the neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_7': 'that we shouldn't go to the street zoning. Would that be an accurate recollection?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, that's I could I can provide more detail. Kelly, can.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can I get the.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'PowerPoint back up?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I have a slide here that compares what that pre application was as compared to the SCC three x. It is correct that when the party was at planning board it had the same opposition at Planning Board and there was written testimony, a written correspondence also opposing it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The differences as compared to the three X were in a number of uses and the height. So yes that it it was going to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Prohibit maybe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some uses and the lower the height.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Probably even the liquor store because it's so close to George Washington. And that's debatable, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, you know, liquor stores.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, it could it could.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's that the rule now that can be waved.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Back. Okay. All right. That that helps me just in terms of why we went to the UCC, it wasn't to make life more difficult for the neighborhood or Councilman Brown, it was to try to get the code clean.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It sensor wasn't that much gain or difference between the two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Kyle, I want to ask a clarifying question, and if you could put up the map that shows the site. What I'm trying to clarify is if the current curb cuts to the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our what is expected to be utilized as ingress and egress for the site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So so there's actually nothing in the zoning that speaks directly to that, but that the applicant site plan that he's proposing here is wouldn't add any new driveway. So it's just the two existing driveways that are on both on the cube smart property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And any idea how traffic would respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you had conversations. So that's probably better for Paul.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Thanks for asking the question. It's a good one. The the traffic light and exposition of the lead still. And we took this measurement at rush hour three weeks ago, roughly. But that traffic light is green for a minute and 45 seconds and is read for like 18 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that means that the city has designed things properly because they want that traffic on resale to flow southeast. So the reality is, if if someone.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Came in here personally.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And decided to go this way, we're going to have to cross the speed bumps, which will be a detriment to go left here over to this light. And if they happen to hit the minute and 45 seconds of red light to make the right turn on leads, they'll they'll probably only do that once or twice because it's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a it's very awkward and it's more time consuming than just flowing with the traffic on lead still.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you clarify if the business CU Smart is that within the triangle of this property if they have approved the speed bumps. Because I heard somebody say that this was something that had to be approved by smart.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The the speed. Let me go back one step. This is the property that we own here. It's roughly an acre. This piece here is owned by Kim Smart.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the two access points are.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Actually on the cube smart property. We have a reciprocal easement agreement to use that for ingress, egress and and access to to our property. The this the speed bumps will be on Q smart property. And they say they suggested to us that we put speed bumps in because we had gone to them and asked them if they'",
        "'speaker_10': 'would agree to closing off that exit. And they said no, but we would agree to put speed bumps in on our property, provided they're properly designed. So we have a yes for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do they have to also approve signage on the site that discourages traffic exiting onto exposition?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, not on our property. They don't have to prove that. But on their property we can put signs here. We would have to give their blessing. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that such signage does not exist today, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, it's it's not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's something. What kind of business is cute? Smart? I'm not sure. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I'd just like to make one comment on that agreement. With that came as a result of the meeting with Councilman Brown and Bob Golic and the association. Is that my understanding is that there was some general issues discussed and a letter agreement could be executed fairly quickly, which would then go to an attorney.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He'd make it a legal document, which we would record against the property as restrictions. So and that's the same with Steve Charbonneau in mediation. He said we if we'd come to an agreement with the association, something could be done very quickly and then convert it to a legal document that would be a binding document as required action'",
        "'speaker_10': 'against the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Any other members of the council? Just one final question. So if that was something that was agreed to tonight, would those in attendance who have spoken against it agree to that? Because I heard one of the concerns that there was no binding way that this was going to be enforced if it's recorded against the property'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I see that as being enforceable. It's just a shake of heads. Could that be helpful from what we understand? Okay. If you're going to speak, I need you to come to the phone to identify yourself again, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nigel Smith, 739 South Korea Street. What we've been told is that any any type of agreements, whether it goes through an attorney or not, cannot be tied to the deed and that it's unenforceable. So, yes, we could agree on it at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But six months down the road, if a if a drive thru is installed, then we would wind up in a in a court battle and it would not have been held enforceable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, that's different than him saying he was willing and agreeing to recorded against the property. Which which would be fine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'From what we understand, is you cannot record that against the property. It's similar to a good neighbor agreement and it's unenforceable.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we're all looking to our city attorney. So, David, can you just clarify that point?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We have several city attorneys in the room tonight, including ones who have been following this throughout. But as long as I've got the mike, let me just remind you all that the applicant has a right to have his application voted up or down tonight in our system.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The opponents have a right to urge you to vote it down. This is not the appropriate opportunity to be negotiating the terms and conditions of the approval from the floor on a monday night. And we consistently give that advice.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, we've we've been called upon to answer questions like this before in terms of the panoply of ways that applicants may enter into third party agreements with neighbors or with neighborhood groups. And it's difficult for us to sit here on a monday night and opine on the specific enforceability of any particular instrument.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'When I listen to the testimony here tonight, one of the things I hear is that is that there may have been some offer, some proposal to have a covenant on the property running with the land that might have imposed certain use or design restrictions on the property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But to whom does that run? And what's the quid pro quo in terms of who would then be bound to offer something back on the other side, such as not challenging this rezoning decision here tonight? That's the difficulty, is structuring a quid pro quo that everybody can be absolutely assured is enforceable at the end of the day'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And it's very difficult for the city attorney's office, any of us, to opine about the ultimate enforceability against whom, in terms of any instrument that they might have come up with on the side. It's not a city document.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It's not the something the city is a party to, and therefore it's not really inside the lines in terms of the role the council is playing tonight, in terms of either approving this rezoning application application or denying it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now I'm going to turn to my colleagues who have been working on this, who may be more familiar with what the various proposed quid pro quo is, and see if Knight Lucero wants to comment in addition to anything I said.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good afternoon, Madam President. Members of the council names here with the city attorney's office. And I agree with what Mr. Broadwell said. The council can I can approve this application or deny the application. I suppose there would be another option where.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Council would be authorized to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Approve this with conditions, but that comes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'With a host of procedural complications that would delay this process further. So I would just extend that to to council that that would be the third alternative.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks, would you be okay with my letting Councilman Brown go before you?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Matter of fact, you can take me off a list. Okay. David summed up my thought.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Did you say taking you out of the building, or can I have you back at the podium, please? And your first name is that. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nate.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Nate, Nate, let me ask you. The city has on contract community mediation concepts. And Steve Charbonneau heads up that nonprofit organization that does provide conflict resolution mediation and facilitation services for the city. They've done it for years. So what happens when they work out an agreement?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Between neighbors and developers. What happens? When Steve Charbonneau heads up is he heads before in my district and it's worked out fine and I've never heard this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, Councilman Brown, I think that would be an agreement between the parties, whether that's the developer and some neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Organization it possibly is recorded against against the property's deed restriction.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or something along those lines. But again, the city is is typically, in my understanding, wouldn't be a party.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To that agreement.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Mr. Broadwell, of course, can correct me if I'm incorrect.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Is that a no comment? Consider that now I in this case, I'm agreeing with Mr. Lucero. That's true. We're not a party to those contracts. I'll just relate. There are situations where I don't know what goes on inside that black box in terms of how it's enforceable and whether or not they have any problem with parties outside'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the box may be blowing up the deal. I agree with you, Councilman Brown. Very often when these things have gotten squared away through mediation, we haven't seen secondary problems later on. Occasionally we do. But but in general, we don't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How it sticks. You know, how they hold it together. I'm not entirely sure. I do know of cases in other cities in Colorado where you may have an agreement with a neighborhood association. But then later on, one individual property owner goes rogue and decides to challenge or oppose the rezoning proposal anyway.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. So. So it's only as good as the parties who are signatory to the deal and whether or not it's entirely squared away in terms of any potential violations on the one side or the other is not something as as the neighbor indicated, we're either a party to nor do we track very closely.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, David. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if I. If I understand correctly, if it's a part, it's a it's usually an arrangement between the developer and the neighborhood. And the city is not a party to it. Does that mean that whether we vote for the zoning or against, they could still afterwards enter into such a agreement that would have the same kind of'",
        "'speaker_1': 'legal binding that it would have had they decided on it beforehand. That being separate from city processes, it's still a possible action. If they wish to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Private parties are always at liberty to negotiate restrictive covenants on property among themselves. Whether they have a zoning pending is just approved, never approved. That's always the property interest and covenants and servitude in between adjacent private property owners is something they're always free to negotiate among themselves.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Any other questions from members of council? The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council Feltham and Brown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Five more months. I tell you, I don't enjoy this again. What I try to do is resolve problems. Not a very glamorous job, but I certainly tried in this effort. I thought after we had the meeting in my office that we had a deal.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, there were some technical things. You got to get the lawyers. All right? But I really thought we had a deal. And I might add that Bob Golic thought we had a deal as well. So I turned to him after that didn't work out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And if I can, I'm going to quote two presidents tonight, which I've never done. And the first quote would be from Lincoln, Our last, best hope. And in my judgment, I thought our last, best hope on this agreement, on this particular case was community mediation concepts, because they had worked and I've worked with Steve and he has'",
        "'speaker_8': 'brought neighbors together. In this case, it didn't work out. I referred to my colleagues to the letter that he wrote us. February the 20th, this year, I believe that was what, Friday, where he says that he talks about the number of hours over the past two days talking with both parties regarding the proposed zone change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the end, my efforts in mediation were not successful. Paragraph The neighbors represented by the two parties here tonight felt very strongly that any change he's talking about, the neighbors in the zoning would cause an intolerable increase in traffic as well as drive through issues in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They were all also concerned about noise and light pollution. They didn't believe any condition can or would be enforced. Third paragraph, Mr. Nuttall agreed to speed bumps, a dip and additional signage at the property's exit onto exposition. He agreed that no quote, food related, close quote drive thru would be allowed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But in the end, these concessions were not seen to provide adequate solutions by the neighbors. Very specifically, the neighbors express a complete opposition to anything other than the zoning remaining as it is for 45, 84. The other president.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'John Kennedy said, never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate. And I think that was the problem, frankly, with the neighbors. They feared to negotiate. And I'm sorry. I think the developer would agree to no drive thrus because that was the problem that was presented.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A planning board. I thought that was. A very sincere effort to resolve this issue. And it wasn't enough. So I'm going to support this rezoning tonight, and I hope my colleagues understand what I've been going through. It's been long, it's been difficult, but I still think this is fair in the long run.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Brown. There are other comments from my colleagues. Councilman Rob.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did you say me? Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Yeah. Charlie, I have a lot of sympathy for what's been going on and a lot of admiration for the leadership that you have showed or tried to show.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But this is really one of the most frustrating reasoning. Zero. In all honesty, I come into many rezonings in council, not quite having made up my mind. That is still the case in this rezoning. Tonight, as I make these comments, I can understand the neighbors frustration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This has been a long disputed site going back to when Polly Flowback represented the other side of the street in DPS, couldn't sell the property. And then eight years ago, thanks for jogging my memory. It was resound in it and I can see where the neighbors say, hey, what's different in the way we put that in?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Trying to decide if we're going to rezone is do we have changing conditions? That's quite a broad term. There's a lot that changes. There's a lot that stays the same. And I'm I'm really trying to think about that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If the B one uses were okay eight years ago and Blueprint Denver had already been approved. I'm trying to figure that one out. I also I'm not crazy about what is now happening and I understand it, but I'm just I struggle with it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That, of course, the community planning and development and zoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Can't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Predict traffic, can't design the roads in the city, can't install traffic control devices. But I do think and I've had to make these tough decisions and often have had neighborhood opposition for it. But I do think that when we consider a rezoning, we can consider what we know into it, what the traffic study say about traffic under'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the clear qualification that we have to decide if this benefits public health, safety and welfare. So I understand that, you know, and I'm just I'm stuck. We could have had a win win. I think we could have had as a situation under negotiation where there was a nice buffer between the site as shown in landscaping.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We wouldn't have had a vacant lot and we could have had no drive through. Now we really I mean, we wouldn't have had the vacant lot. Now we really have to decide between one undeveloped site in something else.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I don't know if anybody else is going to weigh in, but I find this a really hard decision.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Rob Council. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President. I like you, Councilwoman Robb. I find it a very difficult decision to and I. I can I can understand both points of view. The it is a commercial corridor and one wants to maximize what you can do out of a land like this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think, too, there was just some confusion about how an agreement might work between neighborhoods and the developer and perhaps some feeling of of Russian rashness and how and how we could maybe work this out. So I am still debating the decision myself, but like our atlas of the decision, I feel like there is and there'",
        "'speaker_1': 'is still an opportunity for that win win that might not have happened. Before tonight. I still feel like there is that possibility. I hear I hear willingness on the part of the neighbors. I hear willingness on the part of the developer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'At least there was at one time a willingness to talk about these things and see what works out best.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Sussman. Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I also share the same frustration. Which is why I was asking some of the questions that I was asking. You know, on one hand, from the neighborhood perspective, I'm sure that if council votes this up tonight, you're going to feel like you've lost your leverage to be able'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to work this out with the proposed developer on the project. And from the from your perspective, I'm sure you're feeling like, well, you know, you want to be able to proceed with the project. And I would just hope that this is not the end of the communication that would happen if council decides to move this project forward'",
        "'speaker_2': '. I think the issue of pedestrian safety for students is going to be a real issue. The traffic concerns that the neighborhood has, if the volume of traffic is increased, you've got more trips in and out of the site compared to what's there today.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can understand the concerns that the families have about that. But at the same time, I'm struggling here with the fact that you guys were this close, this close to having this nailed down to address the concerns. And my hope is that this is not the end of that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Being able to still work it out, you know, with rezonings of council votes it down. The applicant has to wait a whole year before being able to bring it back and only the council person of the district can file an application to bring something back before that year timeframe.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't know where we're all on this issue. You know, this is something we can't and we don't talk about. But my hope is that this you know, I still don't know how I'm going to vote yet.

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Madam President, I was not planning to speak, but since several of my colleagues shared that they were still hemming and hawing, I thought I would weigh in to share that I will be supporting this rezoning tonight because I do believe it meets the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that many times we have neighborhoods or communities who come before this council and share that they feel that they don't have any control. And what they mean is they can't stop a project. They can't stop change from happening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But in fact, time and time again, I hear them having influence over things based on setbacks, setbacks, design, concessions. Neighborhoods in this city have an enormous amount of influence over development through these processes. And you you know, I think that this community had that chance.'",

If I make that if I make the decision that this block can't be commercial because there's residential behind it, I can't be consistent. Then for the remainder of this corridor of the remainder of Colorado Boulevard or the other major commercial corridors in this city where one block behind them'",
        "'speaker_1': 'exists residential. And so, you know, I don't have the qualms that I've heard from some of my colleagues because I I am left with the criteria. And this rezoning meets those criteria. I'm sad for folks that they didn't feel like they got the perfect deal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But, you know, having spent many of my years before serving on council, negotiating with developers and I understand the city attorney's position that that he cannot advise you or even us on the on the on the enforceability of a hypothetical agreement, covenants that run with the land.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know of many situations where they're violated. And I think you got bad legal advice if you were told that they were not something you could rely upon, because we have many neighborhoods who rely upon them in other types of situations, whether it's affordable housing covenants, it's a very common tool.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And, you know, I'm not the city attorney, so I can opine on things he can't. But so so with that, I just felt like it was important for me to weigh in and state that, you know, our job is to evaluate this and the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a commercial corridor. It is a reasonable use. And we should approve this tonight.'",

Once here, there's the Arrow's Swansea Elementary School and shared use of the open space of Bruce Randolph School near 40th and Colorado. To address the concern of displacement.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The strong section refers to the Denver housing plan and encourages partnership partnerships to create affordable and mixed use housing, especially near transit. There's also an opportunity to explore replacement of housing that is being acquired for the I-70 reconstruction project.'",

Another strategy focused on focuses on local job training that could be coordinated and aligned between residents and businesses to be recruited in the neighborhood. And Education Strategies Encourage Coordination with Denver Public Schools.'",

I am Steve Nally with Community Planning and Development Co Project Manager with him on the O'Leary's. What's your plan? And I'm going to cover the Connected chapter, which is the next guiding principle.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The plan recommends improvements for several rail and street crossing conflicts, including an outdated York Brighton Boulevard underpass that prohibits trucks from passing north into Adams County. You can see it's pictured in the top right and it seems that it has been struck a few times by trucks.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is it is getting bigger over time, but it does need to be expanded in the future. 47th in York, where pedestrians, cars and trucks are held up multiple times each day due to train stacking and loading operations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the inactive market rail underpass, which creates a 25 foot deep channel that impedes access to future 40th and Colorado stations pictured in the bottom right. This is the multi-modal connectivity map, which provides multiple recommendations for improved neighborhood connectivity, including new streets and pedestrian connections to the river and to Globeville through and along the future.'",

I-70 Partial cover lowered alternative to make multimodal connections more convenient a frontage road system along 46th Avenue and I-70 that balances vehicular traffic with surrounding land uses and then last zero potential for new streets to be built into d redevelopment areas for improved connectivity.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The plan also recommended recommends improving truck route system to better serve industrial areas and keep trucks out of residential areas. One example is an extension of 52nd Avenue from Colorado Boulevard to Brighton and York Street, which could provide truck access.'",
        "'speaker_11': '825 Adams County to the Northwest and Colorado to the east. This could help to reduce the truck demand onto Brighton and York Street to the south. This is the missing sidewalks map. You can see the the red on the map indicates the sidewalk is missing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of the greatest needs identified by the community was to improve neighborhood walkability by adding more sidewalks. Missing sidewalks, again shown in red. And some of the key areas are along 40th Avenue, near Bruce Randolph School and around Dunham Park indicated by the Arrows.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The plan does prioritize sidewalk improvements near the rail stations along 40th Avenue, around Dunton Park and Brighton Boulevard. Also, the plan recommends pedestrian priority intersections identified for potential crosswalks and pedestrian activated signals. More arrows. All right. The bike network there today.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are only sound bike routes in the neighborhood. There are no actual facilities in the street. So a number of of bike facilities are recommended to connect residents to the neighborhood amenities such as parks and schools. Some streets, such as Clayton and Cook Street, require further study and neighborhood input.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Bike route recommendations in this plan fit within the greater bike route system and do tie in to the citywide team. Removed bike and pedestrian plan. This map highlights today's ten minute walk around three future rail stations in the neighborhood based on the existing street network doesn't necessarily mean there are sidewalks on these streets to get to the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'station, but just there. But there are streets in place. With all of the recommendations recommended in the plan and strategies recommended in the plan, the potential expanded ten minute walk highlighted in red could result from from building these new streets.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As you can see, a lot more area in close proximity to the station stations. The next guiding principle is the healthy chapter. The healthy guiding principle, as Brad mentioned, health impact assessment, or HIPAA was completed for Globeville, Illyria and Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It was conducted by the Department of Environmental Health as part of the neighborhood planning process. The recommendations are summarized in a healthy section and cross-referenced throughout the plan to highlight the relationship between the built environment, physical activity and health.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Some of the recommendations within that section two examples here are breaking up the large blocks with new connections to create shorter trips and more walkable urban environment, and also to increase tree canopy cover and open space areas with new development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These maps show that Illyria in Swansea has larger than average block sizes surrounding the residential area due to large industrial uses of railways and highways and that less than average tree canopy cover compared to the other neighborhoods in the city, as indicated on the map below.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So those are the guiding principles moving into the six character areas. There are six in the plan, starting with the National Western Center and station area. There's also the 30th and Blake Station area, the 40th and Colorado station area as the traditional residential area, kind of reflecting where most of the homes are today.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the industrial area, the sixth is the I-70 reconstruction area that kind of spans across multiple character areas within the plan. So starting with the residential character area, the the plan details how residents could benefit economically from modest infill development next to existing single family homes and duplexes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Tandem houses, for example. And the ones pictured in the graphics could be built behind a street fronting residents and either sold or rented out ten of houses and other building forms. Under two and a half. Stories could help to bring investment and stability to residential areas and help to bring more residents and increase the demand for neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_11': 'services. The transformative project within the traditional residential area is to study east west connectivity north of I-70 up to 49th, including the 47th and York interchange. You can see there's a resident waiting to continue with her evening, but there's a train in the way and she has no other option of getting east or west.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also, key recommendations from this within the traditional residential area and then also in the industrial area is to improve the relationship between industrial and residential uses. The graphic on top kind of transitions from residential to light industrial flex to heavy industrial.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also on the bottom of this slide, there are recommendations in the plan to show possible landscaping and streetscape improvements that could soften the abrupt transition where residential and industrial uses are likely to remain in place. Moving to the I-70 reconstruction character area, the plan provides detailed recommendations for see, that's I-70, a partial cover lowered alternative.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There have been a number of a lot of discussion about I-70, as it is a very major project taking place in the neighborhood through multiple meetings. One example of something beneficial that came out of the meeting was, as you can see, the image on the left of the slide is the proposed cover at Swansea Elementary School and'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the initial. There was a there's a street or frontage road in between Swansea Elementary and the cover through. A lot of discussion. The frontage road was removed in a later alternative, creating a combined facility for Swansea Elementary School.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that and that cover. Also, here's an image of our view of the Swansea cover looking south along the frontage road where mixed use redevelopment could bring housing a neighborhood around around the cover to create a neighborhood center with increased activity and extra eyes on the cover for added safety.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Here's an example of an another strategy for improving the PCL to encourage creativity and in the freeway sound walls. And the plan really tries to inspire thought and creativity and not just thinking of our typical concrete walls, but getting creative and mitigating noise.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The plan also recommends a second cover at Steel Vasquez. This cover is different than the cover proposed at Swansea Elementary School. The Swansea Elementary School cover is intended to be an asset for recreation, a playground for the school and more of a park Parklife Park like feature.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The second cover is quite visionary and is a long term idea where the cover itself will, where it's adjacent to fairly large parcels, could be a catalyst for redevelopment around the Steel and Vasquez interchange on large parcels of land.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This cover needs a lot more discussion with the community and and how it could be implemented. It's currently not funded as part of the set out project. The next character area is the National Western Center and Station area.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You all have been briefed many times on the the pending National Western Center masterplan. This plan recommends land use for the entire station area and focuses more on the station area part of National Western. In addition to the new street connections, the three National Western, there are also a number of new connections, such as 49th Avenue at'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the DPS site and then future Brighton Boulevard, north of I-70. Here is a glimpse of the masterplan. The response to your plan recommendations are reflected in this detailed National Western Center masterplan. There are new streets and pedestrian connections between Elyria and Globeville, including a new national western drive, a street that was named Betty Kram.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Drive through that process, Betty Graham is here tonight. The concept shows over 46 acres of open space and public plaza that could be used by visitors and by the community. The next character area is the 40th in Colorado station area coming in 2016.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'The vision for this station area is to provide workforce housing and lighter, cleaner mixed use industrial jobs to complement the varied stations between downtown Indiana. The station area planning also looks south of 40th Avenue, where possible new 39th Avenue Green Street is recommended.'",

The plan recommends acquiring the market lead, filling the underpass channel, potentially using the dirt from I-70, heading workforce housing and a pocket park to create a successful transition from the lower scale residential to the west to the hired inner city transit oriented development area to the east and closer to the station.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The final character area is the 38th and Blake Station, the Elyria.

Public investment is the next category of priorities, which focuses on leveraging major projects as well as street, alley, sidewalk and lighting improvements and pursuing the acquisition of the BNSF market lead for connectivity and redevelopment. The last implementation priority or partnerships?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The plan does encourage residents to form a one or many registered neighborhood organizations and to work with partners such as in DCC, DMR Police Neighborhood Inspection Services for improved neighborhood conditions. It also recommends working with affordable and mixed income housing to developers, focusing on economic development initiatives and coordinating job training opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I went to a planning board on January 7th where we had our public meeting. The public at that meeting requested more time to review the plan following the holiday season. So the hearing was continued to January 21st. Prior to the 21st meeting, we had an additional public meeting to work through.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Comments and questions on the plan. We held that meeting on the 12th will an additional meeting on the 16th to discuss the plan with Swansea School parents at the January 21st meeting. The plan edits were proposed based on the public meetings we held.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Prior public testimony was generally supportive. There was one unresolved issue and that was building heights near to rail stations. So the planning board voted to approve by unanimous vote based on their criteria, which is to find that the plan is consistent with other plans, that it was an inclusive public process and takes a long term view.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then the conditions were to incorporate the edits that were presented to them that day, to add edited for clarity and correctness, and then also to incorporate the groups, incorporate the changes from the public meetings that were the public meeting that was held to discuss building heights.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So with that stuff recommends adoption of the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhoods Plan as a supplement to the Denver plan. There's one more thing I'd like to add. Just after the close of recess, two additional members of the community arrived and would like to speak.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of them was in Elizabeth, one of the most devoted members of all of the planning efforts and globally responsive. The other is at Bell so property owner and 40th in Colorado station area. If you see fit to allow them to speak they would greatly appreciate that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary, how do we handle that?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess that your your your call. But you have 19 speakers so far so and if you limit it to our you. I don't. They may or may not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is in our courtesy public hearing. And I'll I'll take comments from other members of council if you want to weigh in on this. Oh, okay. So what I what I propose is that the other 19 speakers are allowed to go ahead of you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And depending on how much time we have within the hour, we can certainly try to fit the two speakers and I'll keep that fine with everybody. Yes, right. All right. As we said earlier, we have 19 speakers, possibly 19, 20, 21 speakers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what I would like to do at this point is invite the first five speakers up to the front and they are as follows. Jude, Dr. Thomas Anthony. Chad Ramirez. Brenda Vasquez and and Hayes. Through Dutcher. Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening. My name is Drew Dutcher. I have lived.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At 4653 High Street in Elyria since buying a home there in 2007, about going on eight years.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have actively participated in this planning process, and I'm also a member of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The National Western Citizens Advisory Committee, and I was the Elyria.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Representative on the I-70 East Pact between 2010 and 2012. Without going into a lot of details, I very enthusiastically support this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think it's long overdue, but I feel that this this at last.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This area, this city is finally getting the attention it deserves. I thank the planning department and Tim and Steve. They've done a fantastic job on this plan. I think it points positively into the future and it shows great promise.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Embeds various public works projects that are sorely needed but are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not yet funded.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel that whenever we talk about Clarion Swansea though.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have to talk about the elephant in the room and that elephant is the planned widening of Interstate 70 through these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'While the partially covered, lowered alternative.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is infinitely better than widening.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The existing elevated viaduct, there's still too many unanswered questions to really for these residents, most of my neighbors to really support the I-70 plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just quickly, there's not evidence really that this widening is justified to ten lanes. It's based on a ten year old study.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We still have not really gotten a health study performed that's required under NEPA.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Many residents have expressed concern that this may possibly violate the 1964 Civil Rights Act.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would this project be forced on wealthier, nonwhite communities?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Last Thursday, the Transportation Commission endorsed the design build, finance, operate, maintain mechanism.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This basically turns the project over to a private consortium.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What we are concerned about is that how will any of the promises made to Elyria, Swansea residents regarding mitigation ever be kept under this financing mechanism? Do these neighborhoods assume all the risks and all the downsides.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Venture? All other parties profit from widening I-70. The local businesses, the National Western Rhino Taxi. The city and county of Denver. The airport and the region as a whole.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How will residents of Elyria, Swansea endure this construction? Are we displaced? For how long? What about the contamination and pollution during construction?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'DUTCHER Here, 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. There are many questions that need to be answered before we can.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We can back this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our next speaker is Mr. Anthony.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Madam Chairwoman and members of the council. I'm Tom Anthony. I had some written testimony I was going to hand in and jotted down some thoughts during the previous presentation. I've lived in 5001 National Western Drive for 17 years with my two little youngest boys, were born there in home births, and I won the Neighborhood Star Award in'",
        "'speaker_3': '2010 for my auntie and was honored with my for forming my group clean it that got the the Shattuck chemical site cleaned up down in 1805 South Beneke from Overland and West University neighborhoods back in 2004. I am.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Helped finance and develop the Illyria Neighborhood Vision Plan in 2006 that showed I-70 below grade for the first time, identified the site at 28th and Brighton for the art to the North Metro line and put in a bridge across the globe below 50th and Emerson how elements that have been adopted in the city's planning process.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But the city's planning process has also been flawed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm currently exchanging motions with young Nathan Lucero, who was testifying earlier as to whether or not I wind up getting to stay in my house or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Anthony, can you please stick to the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, our neighborhood doesn't have a neighborhood group because our neighborhood leaders get targeted by the city and retaliated against for bringing up things and issues that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They happen to disagree with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have a seat or not. Mr. Anthony, please have a seat. Thank you. Our next speaker is Chad Ramirez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But typically at Swansea. Harris.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You can start again. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I was going to say that I'm really not for that I 70 deal at all but so on then the other thing is that connector the gentleman was talking about sending 52nd Avenue westbound from Vasquez. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You guys are probably had your mom tell you to stay on the block when you're riding your bike. So a lot of kids right in that area over there. And there's a lot of kids. There's a park on 52nd Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Years ago, we fought long and hard to keep the trucks out of the neighborhood. And this would just be a thoroughfare for the trucks to go. So I don't think that's a good idea in the plan. I think a lot of it is all right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But I also think in that closing, Josephine, that's another thing that they're talking about. And we really don't think that closing General Josephine Street would be very good. They'd rather be counterproductive. And it actually would probably close a corridor of opportunity for locals.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And then the bikeable and walkable area is a good idea. You know, if because right now we don't really have access to the light rail station, there are quite a ways, quite a ways away. And so what I'd like to see in the plan is some of this ground work take off for the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Residents.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As far as the sidewalks and the bikeable ways to get to the light rail stations as far as a RTD just really blew by us, you know, closed off. And the opportunity, our corridor of opportunity by not putting a light rail station at Clayton or Steel Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So it's going to be tough to get over to those stations. So and then the other thing is when we're still somewhat of a rural area in the neighborhood and you guys have made a distinction between the neighborhoods and the commerce, the areas of commerce.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I want you to remember that. And everybody remember that that we are a neighborhood, we're a residential area. There were our homes are and yeah, we're still kind of in a rural area and we kind of like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Our lots might be big and we like that. We appreciate our property rights and we hope everybody will respect that. And let me see the town central that they're talking about over the second the second cover. You know, I've seen town centers around the country and they're usually dominated by the multinational and the national corporations.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Time's up. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So thank you, Miss Vasquez. Followed by in Hays. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you for this opportunity to speak.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is Brenda Vasquez and we are property owners on.'",
        "'speaker_2': '46th and Josephine.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We have on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The property for over ten years and we've been attending meetings for ten years as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We own a strip mall and in that strip mall.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We have several businesses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These businesses are.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Owned by self-employed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Individuals. So they're locals. They are the old neighborhood businesses. So there's no chains involved. And they they have built relationships with the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Individuals in the area. Swansea, a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Neighborhood. The success of the businesses and by the way, we have very low turnover in our retail areas. The businesses include a restaurant, a cell phone store. We have an ice cream store, also a gym that supports the students at Swans here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And another business that is similar to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'AA and they work primarily with Spanish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Speaking clients. So the success of the business is primarily supported by accessibility. So with the closing of Josephine and some other recommendations, those would severely impact these individuals who have been in business with us for 13 to 15 years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So what I would encourage the Council to remember these individuals and I would encourage you to go and visit the businesses and talk to those owners. Without the accessibility, they will not be successful in their businesses. They as I said, it's a lot of relationship building that has allowed them to be successful in their business and that'",
        "'speaker_1': 'can only be strengthened with accessibility walkability.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To those individuals. We understand that the need for eastbound I-70.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I think we need to continue to to honor the individuals and the businesses that have been created over the last decades.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Vasquez and Hayes. Good evening, Madam President. Members of the Council. My name is Ann Hayes, and I am a citizen of Denver. But more importantly, for this moment, I am. I'm with Westfield Company.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we are owners as of July of this past year of a 14 acre property on Upper Brighton Boulevard between 40th and 43rd.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On the East.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Side. So basically across from the Coliseum, it is within the the neighborhood of Elyria, Swansea. And that is why I'm here, is to express my support for this neighborhood plan. Since our purchase of the property, I have gotten very involved in many of the neighborhood efforts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Including.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The tail end of this planning process, but also have joined the National Western Advisory Committee, the Brighton Boulevard Working Group, the Brighton Boulevard, or Reno Art District, Business Improvement District Working Group. So I have gotten to know many of the people.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In the neighborhoods nearby.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Our property and I do want to express that the there seems to be a lot of outreach that is still would be desired by the neighbors and express our desire to continue with the outreach to the neighbors and hoping to bring a really quality redevelopment project at this location, which is right next to 38th and Blake Transit'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Station. So again, I just want to express our support for this plan and hopefully it will pass. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Hayes. Our next group is Steve Kenny, Betty Cram, Jimmy Bacon, Thad Tasker and Gilbert Vasquez. If you could please come up to the front.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Welcome.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you very much for this opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To be here and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Talk with you. My name is Steve Kenny. I'm a resident of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Berkeley neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My home is 4876 Tennyson Street. It is my opinion that Elyria and Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Deserve every bit of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Attention. Dedication of resources and funding for these programs, probably more so than any other neighborhoods or communities in this city. They've been neglected in a really, really bad way for many, many decades.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've attended meetings about the neighborhood plan. I've read much of the neighborhood plan, and there's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Much of it that impresses me very, very much.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There's a lot of very good work in here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, I am very.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Very concerned and in some ways appalled that the city and Denver could be in any way supporting anything that is related to see. That's plan to make the freeway 3.2 times wider. Literally right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Through the middle.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of these communities. The the goals of this program.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Disjointed connectivity. I don't see how tripling the width of I-70 can possibly help with the connectivity of these communities and tearing out neighborhood shopping centers. Tearing out places where people gather. Reducing the number of options that kids from the from Swansea Elementary School have to cross the freeway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A next goal is missing missing services. Expanding the freeway is not going to help that. There's no possible way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you can you loop your comments back to the earlier response here?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I sure will. Thank you. So I think that especially for environmental issues, nuisances, crime, property neglect, it's imperative that the city support things that will help the neighborhood and that absolutely, positively has nothing to do with tripling the width of I-70 until we have a plan.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that would include CDOT doing SDI, SDI, a supplemental draft environmental impact study of the I-270 and I-76.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Reroute and conversion of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The current I-70.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Through Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Elyria and Swansea. We cannot be supporting a plan that supports the tripling of the width of I-70.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Let's see. Our next speaker is Betty Cram, followed by Jimmy Bacon Fantastica and Gilbert Vasquez. Hmm. Thank you very much and thank you for letting me talk. It all sounds so grandiose. Everything they've done. Beautiful, beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But it isn't. That's where we're Elyria Swansea. And we're Elyria Swansea. And that's what we are. And we don't care for all of this. Others, please take a tour with me as we take a little ride with me from 47th Avenue to 40th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's going to be kind of a road bike path because we do need a bike. We need a bike path for some people, especially for a for Adam, who works there at the girl horse. He rides a bike all the time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So he needs the bike path they took. They wanted to build a street past the school, but I said, no, we need we they Josefine we don't need a Columbine street. I think it would be too close to the school as we go south, cross over I-70 and we go into 40th into 46 right there at a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'little shopping mall, and we stop and we have a donut, chocolate donut, and we have a cup of coffee at our favorite spot. And he does want to buy more land. He wants to build up his mall more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He wants to make it bigger, which we need. And he has beautiful people working with him and he can't seem to get it bought, which is a shame I always seem to hear about when they say building, we're building maybe low income housing or things like that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we have we have so much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Of that right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now in our area. As we go on down the street, there's many houses that are over 100 years old.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On Josephine Street itself, we get to 43rd.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this is where they want to cut me off at 43rd and just I don't know why, but they don't want me going further south. And we have sunshine liquor right there. I don't think he's here tonight. He was going to try to get here tonight, but he had to go to Utah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But he was very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Happy about it. They're going to cut this business completely off if he gets cut off. It used to be sunshine, a drugstore and a barbershop. And it's it's probably over 100 years old. And this fellow, Ron Nelson, has owned it, run it for over 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So he's been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There for a long time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As we go on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Down through.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Past 43rd, we cross over to railroad one railroad track and then the Fastpass track, and we see this beautiful, expansive property. I don't know who is bought it. It must be bought. I see no signs on it. It would make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely need a beautiful restaurant. We need a bunch of our artisan houses, we need a bunch of little boutiques. And they would all fit in perfectly as you go down 40th Avenue and end up with the glassblowing plates right there on 41st Avenue, well, you end at least 40% with you, Josephine.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This Christmas, you can include your comments. Your time is up. I got to be down one more time. The time is up. Oh, it is up. Yeah. Okay, so used Josephine Street. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Jimmy Bacon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then sad. And Gilbert.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hmm.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I guess. Well, I guess first thing, if some day if you if you could pass an ordinance to get a burrito vendor up here on this floor, I think that would be great. Um, but let's see. Okay. But.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All right. Well, my name is Jimmie Bacon, and I have lived. I live at 40, 46, 18 High Street. So if anybody ever wants to send me chocolates or be pen pals, you know, feel free. But I've looked in a lot of neighborhoods in Denver, and I will say that Olivia Swanson neighborhood is inundated with kids.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Gloria Swanson is full of kids. And as much as I hate kids, there is a substantial air quality related. Issue with respiratory issue. And I believe any physiologists will tell you that the respiratory system is the gateway into the body and breathing in exhaust pollutes the blood and that pollutes the body and that affects health and normal'",
        "'speaker_13': 'development. So now I wasn't consulting my crystal ball before I came here, but I got to say that I think widening the interstate somewhere as near as wide as a football field is long is going to be a mistake.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I mean, do you have comments related to the neighborhood plan?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, I do. Think sorry. I thought that this amount of time, too, like before I got here, would, like, slow my heart down and but. And get me more prepared. But it hasn't. Okay, so here we go. The points of the plan above with the disjointed community, the missing services, the environmental issues, the nuances in crime, the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'property neglect of parks and recreation. I believe all of those points can be addressed with a reroute and a a martin Luther King Style Boulevard along 46th Street. I believe that there can be no more stupid kids running around in the neighborhood and also different kind of things for economic benefits like home grown flower stands and cottage'",
        "'speaker_13': 'food style stuff stands around that boulevard. But what I guess I'm saying here is that we open to the possibility that I-70 expansion is truly a bad idea. Creating new taxes, fees, and hope that the private sector will handle this is fine if there were no other options.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But I think in this case but in this case, there is another option, a cheaper one to reroute I-70. And I guess finally, to be extra corny here, Stevie Wonder is coming into town in a few days. And I have been thinking, what would Stevie Wonder say about this interstate not making you drive interstate and.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. The.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Fat tax of 4535 Julian Street Members of council. The plan you're considering tonight reflects a good deal of effort by both the community and the planning department. Like most such plans, it reflects a sincere effort to improve the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Unfortunately, it's doomed to failure first because there's insufficient funds assigned to implement it. And second, because of the plans that are currently being proposed by the Colorado Department of Transportation for East I-70, as has been recognized in a proclamation by this council.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I-70 was first ripped through Elyria and Swansea, it devastated these communities. Homes and businesses were removed. The northern part of the neighborhoods was isolated from the rest of the city, and parishes were destroyed. Long time residents left and were replaced by the people who currently reside there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now an attempt is being made to convince these residents that the connectedness that is espoused is one of the goals of the neighborhood plan will be achieved by tripling the footprint of the highway and building 8 to 14 foot sound barrier walls along almost all the length of the trench.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The healthy community that is another goal supposedly will be achieved by subjecting the neighborhoods to pollution from an additional 40,000 cars and trucks per day, increasing truck traffic through the neighborhood by removing interchanges and encouraging children to play on an unventilated cover over a polluting highway.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Making these matters worse is that despite the fact that the constructing the highway is a state and not a city function, the city of Denver is considering contributing millions of dollars to the construction of this monument to the hubris of our traffic engineers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, those dollars are exactly the type of financial resources that otherwise could be used to implement the many positive aspects of this plan. Indeed, the dollars that would be given to the state to once again devastate North Denver through the I-70 East Project could be used for meaningful, positive projects in all of Denver's council districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Given these facts, I urge you to support the Elyria, Swansea and Neighborhood Plan. However, I urge you to do so only if you are prepared by me to move beyond the plan as an empty statement of unreliable goals intended to pacify the members of the community and to give Elyria resiliency of the resources required to implement the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'plan by refusing to transfer city funds to the I-70 East Project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Gilbert Vasquez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello? Yeah, I'm not really opposed by 70 so much. I know the bridge is in a rough shape, but what they need to do is respect the business people over there and the boulevard. What they're doing with the school that tops what's going on with the people when what they're doing is with the top on one side'",
        "'speaker_8': 'with the kids. That's great. The other side too. I'm go to the little center but doesn't hurt to let people and businesses there talked about close ah Josephine and make that just a three way two three block area which people are used to driving always through it from downtown through what they're going to do they turn into'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Clayton make that the way to go through that two neighborhood street which will that become a more of a hazard for the kids are around the school that lives in that block up and down from 45 to 46.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's where everyone we be driving through where it should be seen the way it is now. If they want to send Josephine through the truck route, fine. But let Joseph Josephine be regular car. New York is fine because the criminals there got me through four.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But let the other part be, as you know, look for the locals go in there because we are all these business people are in there doing thing set business, help the neighborhood get along every neighborhood. They can't forget about the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They can't forget to hit the neighbors. They all like all the stuff they're. And that's why I believe they should do at least respect the neighbors. They don't have a lot of money. But listen to them.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'You have. Good evening, city council members. My name is Nancy Palacios. I am a student at East High School and resident of Swansea, a community. I am a part of a leadership program at Swansea Rec Center. We took a survey of our community and there were top four issues in Swansea neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Our main concerns were safety, health, violence and vandalism. Our leadership group will be presenting on these four concerns. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay. Our next two speakers are Ruby Venegas and Victoria Venegas.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, city council members. My name is Ruby Venegas. I'm a student at STRIVE Prep Sunnyside, and I'm a member of the leadership program. I live in the Swanson community and our program did the survey. And one of the topics was safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is it's really hard because there's no lights in our streets and there's no there is no there's no separation between alleys and parks. And this is hard because kids can get lost in the motor. Exactly. One expense I expected was last summer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was taking out the trash in our street. To have a light was pretty dark and I didn't see anything. And a lot of kids were afraid to go outside because there was the crime scene. They were afraid of getting kidnaped.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All I'm asking is for when you do this project to think about how it's affecting kids and like the safety. And that's all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Is Victoria here?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. My name is Victoria. I live in the Swansea community. I am also with the leadership program as well. And. One of the other problems is health. First, there are no smoke free zones. People in kids can get second hand smoking because lots of people in the park smoke also.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Also, there are people there. There also there is lots of littering. There is also a Sara house right behind the rec center. Many people don't like the smoke. They don't go to the the rec centers park because of the smell.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This has caused people not to go to the rec center and get movie. Their health can get them impacted by these barriers because they aren't exercising. By making smoke free zones. Kids cannot catch secondhand smoking. And by providing only smoke for smoke zones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'People know where to smoke and the other people won't get affected. We appreciate your time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for coming, especially since you have school tomorrow. So thank you very much. Okay. Our next speaker is. Fabolous Marotta. The. Repeat your name because I didn't say it right. What's that? Fabulous microphone. Good evening, city council members.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'My name is Fabio that I live in this one two year community and I'm also part of the leadership program. Another issue in our community is violence. There's a lot of violence, for example, a lot of gang affiliation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'People have witness shooting. There is animal abuse at the Slater house. But don't forget about checks getting introduced to minors. In our whole experience I've had was when I was at school field and all of a sudden the ambulance as well as the police showed up in front of this one seriously.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There was a person getting stabbed and the children there seen it made them feel really unwelcome. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian and I do not have a last name. Do we have one? He didn't write it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Hey, Brian, introduce yourself to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My name is Brian Lobato and. I am also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Part of the leadership program.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the fourth issue was that there was too much vandalism. There's a lot of graffiti. The alleys.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of graffiti.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'People's homes were being broken into, which goes back to the topic of safety, which was number one, trespassing was also an issue, but not as common. My personal experience with vandalism was that the elementary school got tagged. Also, someone broke the back windows of everybody's car and truck and caused a lot of damage.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it was dangerous because glass shards were in the.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Truck and you could hurt yourself. Thank you for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'O'BRIEN Thank. I appreciate you coming. Our next speaker is Jasmine Ramirez, followed by Carla Lopez. Amy and then, Madam Secretary, I didn't catch the name of the last person after AEI.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry, which one?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So person Steve had mentioned or you looked at up. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hello. My name is Jasmine Ramirez. I am a student at Bruce Randolph and High School in the community of Swansea. What I will be talking about this evening is one of my personal experiences which contains by, I mean, yeah, violence.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have experienced a robbery not so long ago my house was robbed and I really don't feel safe living in a community like this. And I know actually I'm positive that everyone in my community believes that there should be a change.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much, Carla Lopez. That evening. See Council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Oh, my name is Carter Lopez and I'm also member at the Leadership Program and the song's lyrics and I live in the Santa community. Something I have personally experienced is vandalism in our community. People are trespassing in other people's property.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, in my house there is graffiti and gang signs all over my fence and garage door. And I many people have around the community have. Um, graffiti and gang signs all over their property and. Well, I hope you consider our request and make this project happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Miss Locus and Elizabeth and Ed Bill.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And Elizabeth Globeville, thank you for the opportunity to talk. I'm part of the National Western Center Advisory Committee, have participated participated as sort of an adjunct neighbor. With this planning process, please hold in greater weight than mine the comments of those that live on property and have businesses in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I want to just say a few things quickly, and it's going to probably seemed disjointed, but I'm in a framework and a little bit as a response to the Grow House letter that you've received, because I feel like I'm in contention and would like to point out some contrast to thinking relative to this plan, which I generally'",
        "'speaker_12': 'support and I think is very exciting probably can that the the comment in there that the process of arriving at this draft was not always smoothly orchestrated, largely due to the cultural disconnect between the planning team and the majority of residents.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'This is a group that's worked with hundreds of residents, and I'm very concerned that non-profits aren't driving. So as residents into the planning process and building that trust even as they accomplish good things. So as we go forward with the implementation of this plan, please understand that it very much supports the engagement of the city council planners'",
        "'speaker_12': ', etc., directly with the neighbors. And please understand that the marquee engagements with nonprofits isn't necessarily as participatory as it can be directly with with the neighbors. Because this plan is beautiful, partly because it leaves open engagement for more development of more details.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I also want to say that the I disagree with saying that the affordable housing is nonspecific. I think that in section B 24, in the plan, page 46, there's a tremendous amount of detail about how to coordinate that with resources, infrastructure of the city to make it a priority.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And followed by that is Section B 25, which I want to point out has to do with improved access to jobs and services because of the high level of lack of education, lack of college degrees and high school education.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'These neighborhoods, it's necessary to increase the skills, the employability and job connections. So if you're truly supporting people, having the stability to stay in their property and this is among the highest owner occupied neighborhoods in in Denver. So I disagree that the that that isn't something that this plan responds to.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think that going forward, it's incumbent upon us to strongly support the integration of the populations, to be able to afford the increased taxes on their houses and their properties going up in value by helping people increase their ability to earn money.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then finally, I just want to say that that I don't I want to go further than the development without displacement, development and economic visualization, revitalization with enhanced quality of life, supporting the stability of the neighborhood residents is a way to truly revitalize a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And even if they hit the reset button and I 70 took it out of the neighborhood or did something entirely different, this plan will work. It is not doomed to failure. It's got fantastic abilities. We do have to develop the money and I think that we could reset some of the I-70 stuff and we do need to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'look at narrowing it and that is mentioned in the plan. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out tonight and being patient with us. Mr. Ed Bell.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you and thank you, counsel, for letting us let me speak tonight again. My name is Ed Bell. I'm a resident of Rapport County, but I'm in the process of purchasing two and a half acres due west of the 40th and Colorado commuter rail station.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It is my goal down the road to develop the property into a mix of light industrial, mixed income, housing and retail. Last year I had the opportunity to meet with Tim and Tim Watkins and Steve Nally of the Denver Planning Department to discuss the potential future development of the properties in the area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They took time out of their busy day to spend almost an hour with me going over the area of shared with me the work they were doing on the Galleria Swansea neighborhood plan. As a result, I became more involved in the public process that designed to include all the stakeholders in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I found the process that was employed to be very inclusive of genuine effort was made by the Denver Planning Department, including to include all the members of the neighborhood residents and property owners alike. I don't know exactly how many meetings were held, but I imagine that not many other neighborhood plans have seen such an outreach to the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'community. The Denver Planning Department should be applauded for creating such an inclusive and educational process. Valerie and Swansea neighborhoods should be also recognized for the amount of constructive input they provided. It's unusual for communities to get involved over something that's such a positive change.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Does the plan make everyone happy? We've heard a lot of talk about I-70 tonight. Probably not. But the plan does not shut out those who have. Concern. In fact, they specifically call out those concerns and recommend more study.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The biggest area that I'd like to talk about is the area around 40th and Colorado commuter rail station. Starting on page 108 of the neighborhood plan is the description of the recommendations, the area around the 40th and Colorado commuter rail station.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'These recommendations are and are transformative and apply upon a partnership between the public and private sector.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One of the most important factors limiting private.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Development and development of any kind in the area is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Spur that bisects the surrounding neighborhood, creating pedestrian and automotive traffic disruption. It is my understanding that the city and county of Denver is leading efforts to acquire the tract referred to in the plan as the market lead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'On page 115 of the plan. Two pages are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The importance of this parcel. Given the powers the railroad companies hold, the city and county of Denver needs to lead the way by purchasing the property from Burlington Northern Santa Fe and partnering with the private sector for the implementation of the recommendations detailed in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The 40th and Colorado Rail Stations. Long term success requires the market lead be developed and the recommended connectivity be created. I'd like to take this time to thank the Planning Department, especially Tim Watkins and Steve Nally, for their efforts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The plan is very well thought out.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Bell, your time is up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Much. Thank you. Okay. That concludes our speakers. And the first question I see from members of council is from Councilwoman Kennish.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Madam President, I was wondering if one of the planners could pull up a map and just talk to us about what we've been hearing about the Josephine Street? Because I'm not sure I caught it in the presentation, and it was clearly a theme.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you could walk through what specifically the plan is proposing, how firm that is, and that would be helpful for me, please.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'All right. So this is the multi-modal connectivity map. I don't know if you can see my cursor, but that would be good if you could. Can you see my cursor on your screen?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. So this is Josephine. It is a one way couplet. One way north and York is one way south. Right now, with I 70, you can get off of the interstate at York. If you're heading east, you can get on to the interstate at through Josephine and along Stevenson place.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If you're heading west, the the proposed project eliminates access at York and Josephine. So the plan is recommending to weighing both Josephine and York because it no long there's no longer an access or off ramp off of I-70.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'York is two way to the north of 47th. York is two way to the south of 40th to have a 4 to 5 block one way, couple of without the off ramp. Didn't make a whole lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so that's that's the recommendation in the plan. This map shows a pedestrian bridge at Josephine because that is what is proposed by the current set up project. The thinking was Josephine ends at just north of 47th and it was an opportunity to save cost in the project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The interim condition between a new highway without access at York and Josephine prior to the two wing of all of York. Because this at York and Josephine and the East Rail, a new intersection was just built to accommodate that northern movement, to head up Josephine.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there there would be an interim condition of one way couplet without an off ramp, in all likelihood. So a lot more study needs to take place. What does it mean to eliminate this access here, and what does it mean to have a one way couplet for four blocks?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what are the impacts to actually move traffic back over to York if there is a PED bridge at Josephine? So the plan is just reflecting kind of what Seerat is showing as far as the PED Bridge plan is recommending to Wayne York.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And there are a number of reasons for that. It's to get the trucks off of Josephine, get the trucks over to York, which is the arterial street. As far as the actual connection at Josephine over I-70, that needs to be studied further.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As part of that, as we gather more information of what it means for traffic patterns without an interchange there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just Madam President, if I may just clarify. So for those residents who raised questions, there's two issues, which is, one, what is I-70 proposal due to York and Josephine? And then the second is, how does this plan propose reacting?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I heard a lot of residents say that Josephine would be closed. I'm assuming that those of you made that comment were referring to the see that exit being closed? Not so much how the plan responds. Am I.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Or do you not?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think the closing is the PED Bridge that's proposed. I think a lot of residents want that to be a vehicular connection over I-70.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I see.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think that is the concern.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So say to me again, so I even though you just went through it, then I missed something. I thought I heard you say you're going to make Josephine two way, but is there a place at which Josephine is to a and then close to vehicles.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that. I missed that again. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So then so the long night. But yes there are kind of two things going on here. One is a pet bridge over I-70 or vehicular bridge over I-70.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's an either or.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's that's not currently in the plan, but that's the first issue.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The other thing is to wing of those streets. So if we can separate those for a bit, this map reflects the proposed I-70 project, which is a PED bridge at Josephine. But the plan also recommends studying traffic patterns along York Street and Josephine Street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I can actually read the recommendation. You work in Josephine function today as a one way couplet, a condition which creates significant truck and traffic impacts along Josephine residences, predominantly front Josephine north of 43rd Avenue with mixed use industrial uses that predominately from 40th Avenue and 43rd Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'As part of a travel shut analysis, conduct additional travel pattern studies and conduct neighborhood outreach to explore the desire for and trade offs associated with canceled consolidation of York and Josephine into a streets. Also explore opportunities to keep trucks on York Street to minimize negative impacts of residents along Josephine Street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that's. The key recommendation of the plan. The map is reflecting the proposed project for I-70. Should the proposed project for I-70 change and there is actually a vehicular connection, I think it would still meet the goals of the plan of greater North-South connectivity and a number of other recommendations in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you so much. So I just I'll say it back real quick. Make sure I heard it right the final time. So. So the plan does not decide the outcome of Josephine. The plan describes exploring. And so those who have concerns can rest assured that this plan doesn't assume the answer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It simply says this has to be studied. Is that. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct. It's a it's complicated and sorry for the complicated explanation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you very much. Thank you, madam.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilor McKinney. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Madam President. Maybe let's go with Tim, because I've had some conversations with Tim around this issue a lot. So, Tim, just on record, I just want you to say what's in the plan for height limits on 40th, the two stations, 40th in Colorado and 38th.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Blake. And I'm just going to say and you tell me if I'm right. So for for both of those stations, we are at CMA six eight. The recommended the recommended height limits a C max eight with an ash tricts on the 30th and Blake Station that I can go up to 12 stories if approval from the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'coal neighborhood in Elyria, Swansea neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's very close. And I would first describe the 40th and Colorado station area as transitioning from two and a half to three, then stepping up to five with a maximum height of eight closest to the station. And I do have the map up on the screen showing the darkest orange color as eight storey maximum at that station'",
        "'speaker_11': 'location is very much a intentional effort to create that terracing from established residential up to the taller building heights. Same with the National Western Center stationary as you can see those terracing heights but specific to 38th and Blake Station area as well as along Brighton Boulevard up to south of I-70 and also west of the Union Pacific'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Rail Yards. The eight stories with an asterix links. Well, it calls out this this language that says up to 12 stories could be explored in strategic locations through discussion and collaboration with community, with the community and applicable neighborhood organizations.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So additional conversation to take place.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, and I agree with that in you know, the struggle here is well, first of all, it's it's not near applicable neighborhoods, especially at 30th and Blake especially 40th and Colorado 30th. And Blake is is near the Cole neighborhood and in Reno kind of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, it's it's it's it's tucked in that way. So I just I want to make sure that the whole neighborhood is specifically called out in in that in the 30th and Blake Station and it is not. It kind of is because you have the applicable neighborhoods, but it's not specifically called out.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But if I may. Whenever we receive a rezoning application, we notify all registered neighborhood organizations within 200 feet of a subject rezoning. So if it is if it is technically that portion that is to the east of the tracks that falls within this planning area code would be notified.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And that language is intended to be I'm.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure of it. But you see, the issue that we that we have here is that even though neighborhoods may be notified, kind of, you know, the whole neighborhood wasn't a part of. There are some members that came out and Tim did a actually a great job trying to reach out to the whole neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But folks get lost in the shuffle and at the end of the day, you don't hear about it. We do. And so I just wanted to I just want to say that publicly, that call will be notified. You listed every neighborhood organization's going to be notified of of this issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The reason I say this is because right now, all the land right there on 30th and Blake, most of it is empty and there are planned developed site plan developments already talking about this. And so neighbors need to be ready for, you know, whatever, whatever comes.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But we need to be very, very clear in the neighborhood plan about those issues. And as for the for 40th and Colorado, the two applicable neighborhoods would be Swansea and Clayton. Is that correct? Northeast Park Hill, Clayton and Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Northeast Park. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I might just add to that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Briefly that the River.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'North registered neighborhood organization Boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe, go up to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'South of I-70 or at least along Brighton Boulevard and overlap into the statistical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Area of Elyria and Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there are registered neighborhood boundaries that overlap with artistically neighborhood boundaries and it does become very much about proximity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. My first question was for Brad Buchanan, but I saw that he left. So let me ask either Steve or Tim. Tell us what the benefit is of any neighborhood having a neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But you know, the shorter the long answer. Well, this this plan is the guide for the future of the neighborhood. It is for the neighborhood to hold up and say, this is what we want in our neighborhood. It is for city planners to hold up in front of our city council and decision makers and say, this is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'what the neighborhood wants for the future of their neighborhood. It's it's a vision. It's a it's kind of a playbook of how the future should play out and for the neighborhood. Tim, help me out here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So let me just say, historically, neighborhoods that have neighborhood plans get to use those as a priority for insisting that issues in those communities get funded that historically have have sort of been overlooked in the neighborhood plan elevates those improvements or those issues that the neighborhoods identify.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can you just clarify if that's still accurate?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But it's the neighborhood plan identifies the projects to fund.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If a neighborhood doesn't have a plan and a list of projects to fund, then those projects won't be funded.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. So along those lines, because there are major projects that are going on in this area, I-70 and the National Western Project, if some of these improvements are not part of those two big projects. I'm not sure I see the light at the end of the tunnel that there will be funding available for some of the priorities'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that the neighborhoods want in these communities because so much city and other dollars will be. Basically targeted for those large projects. And so can you tell me whether or not anything that's been identified in the plan is already funded?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know that our 2015 budget included, I believe it was $46 million for this area of the city. Are any of the projects in this plan being funded by those dollars?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So rebuilding Brighton Boulevard is one of them. The majority of the I believe that 46 million for this area went to Brighton Boulevard and that is within this planning area and is recommended by the plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But but other benefits are improvements to the residential neighborhood. And I'm not discounting the importance of what needs to happen on Brighton Boulevard because there is so much development activity happening there today. Right. So whether it's 50 seconds or addressing the railroad crossing at York and 47th or some of these other priorities that have been identified'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in the plan, can you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Speak?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't have a list of all of the funded projects, but there is a sidewalk project funded for 48. Money has been identified for a sidewalk along a 40th Avenue. Both of those are identified as priority projects in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So money has been identified in the 2015 budget for studying East-West connectivity, specifically at 47th and York. So it's not a capital or a physical improvement, but it's studying what that improvement could be in further detail. There's also we're also working very hard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where does that go from? East. West. You said it's an east west connectivity from York to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Basquiat's.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's east west connectivity basically along the upper tracks. So it's between 970 up to 49th. Pull up a map. That these are the the general is the general study area for that east west connectivity study. So it's not clearly defined as the east sorry, the north south streets on either side.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's more about traveling east and west between I-70 up to 49th Street as it relates to the up tracks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And is that because part of the connectivity for the neighborhood ends up being compromised as a result of the I-70 project coming in? Because as I looked at the map, it's very evident that the current, both east, west and north south connectivity, particularly for Elyria, almost disappears.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In Swansea, it looks like some of that connectivity happens north and south because of the the lid that is put over I-70. And then it looks like there are some additional bridges over I-70. I'm not sure that they're all connected to the to the lid or not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So can you address that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah. So the the highway is is proposed to widen, as you've heard tonight. But for Elyria, there is little change in the Street Network. This study is intended to improve that street network for Elyria and Swansea. It's intended to improve connecting to each other.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That is a condition of the 47th in York intersection, not a condition of existing I-70 or proposed I-70.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But it is a fact that the connectivity that they currently have that's under I-70, which is 46th Avenue, disappears as a result of the widening of I-70.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's just to the north of I 70. So 46 is still there. It's just instead of instead of being underneath I-70, it's next to I-70. So it's I think it's a wash as comparing what's there today versus what would what is proposed to be there in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Unless I'm not understanding your question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. And I guess part of it is that it's the the connectivity that exists today in the way that people can get from Globeville to Elyria to Swansea, which, you know, is a pretty direct and easy flow, except where you got to kind of jog around from Washington Street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So part of that really gets kind of chopped up as a result of the I-70 project being widened. And by putting 46th Avenue beside I-70, it further widens the footprint of the overall project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Can you tell me when the decision was made that the playground on the lid is actually a. You mentioned that it's it's the it will be the school playground. And it's my recollection from a number of the meetings that either I or my staff attended that the neighborhood would have input into what would go on to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that lid. And I know that Saeeda and Denver Public Schools will be having a meeting. I don't have the date where they will be talking about that now being the school playground. And so I'm a little concerned that the residents of the neighborhood have not necessarily had a lot of input into that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So what can you tell me about that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, so actually, last Friday, DPS and parents from Swansea Elementary School met with members of the community and residents of the neighborhood. The city was there and she was there to kick off a process to figure out what this covers should be in the future.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The neighborhood plan kind of sets out some goals of what should be there, but also recommends that the community see the DPS parents of students as well as elementary school, the city and other potential partners to collaborate on the design and long term management of this cover, considering a few things so that a decision hasn't been made'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Discussion is taking place currently is how this can be a community asset, not just an asset for the residents, also an asset for the students and a combined facility and a collaborative effort.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm I'm glad to hear they've taken a step back because I had learned from both see that in DPS they were moving forward until they realized that residents had not really had an opportunity to weigh in on that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I'm pleased to hear that they are ensuring that there is a more inclusive process here. The last question I have is when you showed the picture of the open channel and yet it then had a picture of housing over that has has there been the drainage ditch or the where it would be?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where the drainage ditch, I believe, is proposed to go toward the railroad tracks are okay. Okay. So it's my understanding that's where the open channel was going to be for the drainage. Correct. But then I saw some housing over that so well.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it's it's a little complicated is a lot of water flowing to the north, but not so much in this particular area. So the combined drainage concept is a combination of pipes, green streets and open channels. For this particular portion.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That ditch isn't actually the open channel. There is a proposal to do to actually convey water through Monroe Street. And then as the market lead turns basically into 39th and there's an opportunity to open that up as an open channel.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this graphic that you're seeing with potential development and a pocket park on top of that bridge is is that is consistent with and the Green Street is consistent with the concept that's being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That was something new to me. So that's why I had to ask about that, because I wasn't. It wasn't clear what was happening with that drainage. Okay. Just want to follow up. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If I could just quickly respond to your first question regarding purpose of a plan and the influence that a plan can have on funding, helping make the case to fund a project. River North Plan was adopted several years ago.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It made the case for improving Brighton Boulevard, which then has led to its current redesign and reconstruction.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay, thank you. I have no further questions. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Can I ask Drew, can I ask you to come up just a second? Okay. Thank you so much for hanging in there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No problem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So along the lines of Councilwoman Ortega's question as a member of the neighborhood and all of the involvement that you've had, this is it related to the digits, related to what is your opinion on the merits of having a neighborhood plan in your in your area?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, I think without a plan, there's not really any vision. And there's it's also nothing. There's no direction that the city would have to fund projects or to improve improve the neighborhoods. And I think the lack of a plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In these neighborhoods has.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Been very detrimental and, you know, caused, you know, some neglect, sometimes outright harm. So the plan, I think, is a positive step forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And are there can you share with us the things that you imagine going forward? Should this plan be adopted tonight?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think that as.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If it's really integrated into.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other huge projects, you know, that the National.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Western and Brighton.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Boulevard, that it could be very, very positive that there's some.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That those might catalyze a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Regeneration of malaria in Swansea. I think that regarding I-70 we have to be really very careful and it's still very undetermined what's going on there. The drafts, the supplemental.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Draft, this was just it left so many questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Unanswered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That I'm really worried.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How how we how that goes forward. I really in some ways, I wonder with the I-70 project, what will be left of our neighborhood. I mean, we can't get any answers about the construction of this. How are they going to do that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, are we displaced? We have to leave our homes. For how long? You know, so that's the big unknown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, thank you. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are there other comments from members of council? QUESTION Let's see, where am I? All right. Seeing none. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Madam President, I was deferring to you as a sitting council on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I I'll go last. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we have talked so long, we didn't scared the kids out of here who deserve the most credit for being in here from 530 until 930. And so and I don't know if they'll never watch Channel eight, but unfortunately, I just want to say I am I was moved beyond words to see six, six kids speak into'",
        "'speaker_9': 'our plan in a in a very passionate and incredible way. So I want to thank those kids for being here. Leaders, really. You know, I'll just say this without a plan, people perish. And and so I'm I'm quoting a little a little scripture there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I think all the folks who say that this plan will not do anything. Literally have not seen what plans have done in this city. Plans. Things get funded if they're measured and plan for it. It's very clear.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I'm not worried about that, that that's not what I'm worried about at all. Matter of fact, every I think every little issue in this plan is going to get funded and this city is going to be I think I think Drew said, regenerate it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But the other word that I would say is gentrify that. That's what my fear is, is gentrification in this piece. 80205 The neighboring zip code you guys have heard me say it a million times is number one, gentrified zip code in the city, state and 12th in the United States.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And now it's coming to a la Swansea, a Anglophile. And so what are what is community sustainability look like? And that's that's what I'm concerned about in these neighborhoods. And so Councilwoman Monteiro has been working hard to make sure that there are some affordable housing options to.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Make sure that the community has places in the community where they can stay. Be a part of the community. And making sure that those investments in I-70 in the stock show realize that they need to understand that community sustainability is the number one goal.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think people have been hearing that loud and clear. And I've been in meetings where it's been awkward because Councilwoman Monteiro has called people out to make sure that they understand that that's a priority. And so that's the kind of leadership that you need.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, I just Councilwoman Teri has been doing a great job and and it's been a great example for me. So I think going forward, seeing the Urban Land Conservancy in some of their plans on affordable housing and the things that they want to do in in this area is going to be really important supporting local'",
        "'speaker_9': 'businesses, but supporting the nonprofits that are already doing great work. And Glover earlier. Swanson And making sure that they have long term leases, making sure that they have a vision for the neighborhood, making sure that they are funded.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's going to be really important so that community support is incredibly important. Any time I know there's a lot of concern over the highway and any time you invest $1,000,000,000 into a neighborhood in an area, it changes things radically.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I think it's it's right for Drew and others to to be concerned. And by the way, I live in Cole, so I live six blocks away from this neighborhood. And so my kids, my neighbors are concerned as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so but I think I think what you see up here and you all aren't a part of the meetings, but is a deep concern about pollution, about, you know, drainage issues, about connectivity within the neighborhood. Many council folks who have been in these I-70 meetings are working hard to make sure that that gets done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I just want to thank everybody for being here late, and I want to thank Councilwoman Monteiro for leading the charge on this. And getting this done is the first time in this city's history that this gets done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And by the way, that's a big deal because Cole Clayton, North City Park, do not have city plans at all. This is a big deal. Realize it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. First, I want to thank all the residents and business folks who came out tonight and for your patience in waiting through the previous zoning that we had. I want to thank Councilwoman Monteiro for her leadership in working to bring forward a neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It really takes a push from your councilperson to get the city staff to say thank you to Steve and Tim to work with the neighborhoods, to put these plans together and make sure that the priorities, as they are identified by the neighborhood, are incorporated into these plans.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think it's important to say that the I-70 project does have direct. Impact on these neighborhoods. And, you know, I've sat through many, many meetings, as well as my staff, along with Councilwoman Monteiro and her staff. And one of my frustrations is that we have had ongoing weekly meetings with the city, and we're beginning to sit in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'on some meetings between the city and CDOT. And in the last meeting that I sat in on, we were told the issue of reducing the footprint other than just addressing the width of the lanes where the shoulders, for example, could could meet a different standard that we're we're really not going to be talking about reducing the footprint'",
        "'speaker_2': 'of this corridor through these neighborhoods. And that's very disturbing to me, because the impact to these neighborhoods is going to be significant, more so than any other neighborhood in this city that I'm aware of. You know, if you look at the map and literally count all of the lanes, including 46th and and 47th, 46th, and the on'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and off ramps. It's it's it's a huge impact to these neighborhoods. And so, you know, this plan, I think, plays a huge role in trying to address many of those issues and those impacts. But just having participated in that process, I have to say it's it's frustrating.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There is a meeting that is being held tomorrow evening at 530 at Bruce Randolph Middle School. There have been a series of smaller meetings that were taking place in the neighborhood where the city of Denver was talking to groups in the neighborhood of the parents who meet with the principal, some of the nonprofits, other folks in the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community to hear concerns and try to incorporate those into the recommendations that are moving forward or the negotiations that are moving forward with CDOT. So this meeting tomorrow will be to, you know, share back with the community that we've heard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You hear the things that Denver is working to address and incorporate as part of the concerns that we'll be fighting for as part of the second I-70 project. So that will be again 530 tomorrow evening at Bruce Randolph Middle School.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For those of you in the neighborhood who can attend and pass on and share the information with your neighbors. Lastly, I think just the whole issue of the playground, I'm really pleased to hear that they've taken a step back to include the neighborhood folks in deciding what that lead should look like.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And, you know, obviously, because that is calling that mitigation, they're going to have to not only fund the improvements, but fund the ongoing maintenance of the improvements that go in there. So I know there's a lot of intertwining, but again, I think I-70 is the 100 gorilla in this conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was important to have the neighborhood plans move ahead of some of these bigger projects to ensure that the issues that the neighbors have identified, connectivity, open space, just all of the issues that are in the plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The air quality issue is huge because of the health impacts that people in these neighborhoods have been impacted by for the many years that I-70 has been through the middle of these neighborhoods. But again, I just want to commend everybody who's been involved in shaping the priorities in this plan and look forward to seeing more funding to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'address the implementation of it. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I am very happy to see this neighborhood plan in front of us finally and ready for a vote. I know that. Councilman Monteiro, thank you for your work and thank you to the community and the folks that are here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I, too, wish that the the young ones were here, but there's nothing better than no better way to implement a neighborhood plan and to get an education in the community. And I think, you know, at the end of the day, that's what the neighborhood plans are designed to do.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're much more about much less about zoning and about how high you can build and where you can build it. It's about neighborhoods and neighborhoods depend on. People depend on neighborhoods to thrive in order for them to thrive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if at the end of the day, in Elyria and Swansea and other neighborhoods, they still have not had another neighborhood plan or have an updated neighborhood plan in a day. I think you you want to improve the neighborhoods in such a way that you put capital into the hands of those people that are there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And you do that by improving everything that the city can touch and has authority to improve sidewalks, streets, parks, amenities, crossing zones, safety, lighting, a neighborhood plan addresses all of these things. And I know that there's a lot more people who probably could be here were it not for a monday night and snowy and probably for their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'work schedules. And I know these neighborhoods very well. I worked as a community organizer, the, you know, train with the cross-community coalition and some good people in that community. And I came out of there learning how to organize.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And these were the neighborhoods that that I that I first organized in. I met so many of the people like great people, great neighborhoods. Lorraine Granado used to take me to teach me how to do house visits. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there's a lot of leaders that have contributed to this that have, you know, built it up. It's good to see one councilman that has office to take it to the next level with the neighborhood. My mother was a elementary school teacher at Swansea Elementary for a number of years in DPS, and she was still a teacher'",
        "'speaker_3': '. So I know the neighborhood very well. I'm glad to see the plan. Very proud to see the folks here tonight. And today is a victory for the neighborhood and for the district. So 1017, you will be victorious. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm glad to vote to support it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you so much, Councilman Nevitt.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'll be brief. This is, I think, an absolutely stellar neighborhood plan. But as Mike Tyson famously said, everybody's got a plan until they get.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Punched in the face.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a community that is no stranger to getting punched in the face and they've been punched in the face over the last 50 years. But it's a community that's resilient and tenacious and given half a chance, will be able to implement this plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so I want to congratulate the community for being that resilient, tenacious community that wants to have a chance. I want to thank the planning for putting so much time and energy into working with the community and coming up with this plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And finally, I just want to congratulate I've said this before several times in committee, but I just want to congratulate and express my appreciation to Councilwoman Monteiro. You have fought like a tiger for this community, and you have been tenacious and relentless and haven't let anybody forget this place and its importance and that it needs to be'",
        "'speaker_8': 'given that half a chance. And so this is a proud day for you as well. So let's get this sucker passed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Nevitt, other comments from members of council. I want to I just wanted to go last so I could get my thoughts together. And what I want to do is thank planning, community planning and development and city of Denver and all the other agencies that have worked along the way with us, the NTC'",
        "'speaker_2': ', the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative. I want to thank my council aide, Nola McGill, who is so loyal and so dedicated to this neighborhood that she deserves an applause. I also want to thank the Swansea Recreation Center Leadership Group who were just amazing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I was sitting there trying to visualize my daughter being up there talking and you know, it's quite a feat. And I want to tell the community members that this process has been helpful. It's been concerning and it's been inspiring.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I've learned so much from working with everyone, and I, I hope that everyone has learned a lot listening to each other. We when we first started on this first step, I remember Nolan and I sitting in a conversation at our office saying, this can't be this can't be like any other plan that's ever been done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is this is all areas once a year. And what is at the heart of it and the heart at the heart of what happened here is that. Decades of the neighborhood being traumatized by poor policy choices. There was a big, big element of distrust, though, from the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We tried to work with that and figure out what we could do. And we started by doing an asset, a resource planning session with all of the people that with within the city, different agencies that made decisions about where money goes, you know, what's being done in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we asked them, you know, what have you done for with what we we're doing? We were including Globeville. What have you done for Globeville? Various wants it. And what do you plan to do in the future? And that's when we were done with that exercise, with the blessing of the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That seemed to be a pebble that was thrown in the water. And it started and it started rippling. We were able to bring, you know, the snap truck that was right in front of Swansea Element at Swansea Recreation Center.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're able to do bike lanes and finish lots of other little projects, were able to look at street signs and look at truck routes and get funding to do a health impact assessment.

        "'speaker_2': 'divided the neighborhood in the past that probably did not have the best relationship with neighborhood people. And my hope is that and I know that people of Globeville, Elyria, Swansea will advocate for themselves with this plan that you have with you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I take heart that I know that you will do that and that you have representatives here at City Council. Now that we have a plan that you can show to them and say, you know, this is our vision and help us find funding to continue to have these things go forward.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The representatives that will in the future be elected to represent Elyria, Swansea. It's only going to be that good.

        "'speaker_2': 'And just so that you'll know part of what we've done along the way to, as I mentioned, the health impact assessment. So that's there as you're looking for funding, you can relate it to a specific thing in the health impact assessment, for example, a regional recreation center in the future for this area.'",

There needs to be more. We also have another group that is looking at creating pathways for people that live in these neighborhoods, creating pathways from'",
        "'speaker_2': 'all the way, getting coaching to get your GED to be able to continue on and look at mentorships or stewardship or apprenticeships with future jobs that come in the future. So it's all there. It's going to be a lot of work, but I can't think of any stone that we didn't turn over and look at.'",
