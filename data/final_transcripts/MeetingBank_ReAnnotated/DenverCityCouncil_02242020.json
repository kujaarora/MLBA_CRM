        "'speaker_0': 'If you want more information, please visit Denver gov dawg slash census 2020. All right. That concludes the announcements for this evening. There are no presentations, but we do have one communication. Madam Secretary, will you please read our communication?'",

Council President Clark and Members of City Council. Over the past several days, I have heard from thousands of residents passionately expressing their opinions on both sides of this issue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to thank everybody who has shared their views, especially those I have spoken to personally experts in veterinary care, animal care and control, as well as residents of our city who have had experiences with the pit bull breeds, all to gain a broader understanding of what this change would mean for our community and those who own'",
        "'speaker_3': 'these dogs. After deep reflection and consideration, I find that I cannot in good conscience support this legislation and will exercise my authority as mayor to veto it. Let me say at the outset that I salute the sponsor of this ordinance, Councilman Herndon, and his fellow council members who have tried to craft legislation that creates a data and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'licensing system for these breeds that is supported by veterinary experts and encourages owners of pit bull breeds to manage their pets. Unfortunately, less than 20% of all pets in Denver are currently licensed, which raises significant questions about the effectiveness of this proposed new system.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While much progress has been made in recent years to increase that number, more intentional efforts around responsible pet ownership, dog licensure and registration and off leash dogs are needed before this proposal should be considered. The reality is that irresponsible pet owners continue to be a problem and it is the irresponsible owners and their dogs I must consider'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in evaluating and the overall impact of this ordinance. We cannot diminish the very real, very traumatic experiences of those who have reached out to me to share their stories. Well, I appreciate the effort that Councilman Herndon has put into crafting this ordinance and its guardrails.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I do not believe this ordinance fully addresses the very real risk to severe injury that can result from attacks from these particular dog breeds, especially should they happen to a child. At the end of the day. I must ask whether passage of this ordinance would make our homes and neighborhoods safer or pose an increased risk risk to'",
        "'speaker_3': 'public safety. I have concluded that it will pose an increased risk. Increased risk. I encourage members of City Council to reconsider their approach to this ordinance, which has been in the municipal code for over three decades. If we were to make this change now and harm comes to someone as a result, then we have done a disservice'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam Secretary. The communication regarding regarding the veto of Council Bill 2271 is received and filed. All right, Councilman Herndon, I understand that in on this issue, you have a motion to override the veto. On Council Bill 2071.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Mr. President, I move the Council Bill 20 20071 passes, notwithstanding the disapproval or objections of the mayor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded. We will do questions and comments combined on this. So questions or comments, you can go ahead and chime in on Council Bill 2071. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. President, I was going to allow my colleagues to ask any questions if they wanted to go first. And then once all the questions were exhausted, I would just leave with the comments. So if anyone, I do not have any questions, but if other colleagues did, I wanted to allow them the opportunity to ask before I went'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't it doesn't look like. Councilman Ortega, do you have some questions?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do. My question is for Councilman Herndon. I'd like to know how many community meetings were held citywide to talk about this issue before this was brought forward. I was not aware of any that were held, and I think that is a concern that I heard expressed across the city from different neighborhoods in a lot of the'",
        "'speaker_8': 'communication that I received. And so I wanted to ask that I understand you've been talking about this for quite some time, but the first I heard about it was, I think the week before you filed the bill, you brought the information to me, gave me a copy of the bill.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But prior to that, I was not aware that there had been any meetings held in the community. So.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. I did not hold any community meetings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilmember. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Well, first, I want to thank all of the members who I have reached out to over the course of the last week and all of the members of the community who have reached out to me to urge me to look into this further.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, I've spent a lot of time talking to Councilman Herndon about this in particular. Sorry for all the emails, Chris, but I. I do just want to say, you know, that this is a really difficult decision.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And, you know, because I, I, I definitely feel for a pit bull owners. I feel for you guys. And after watching the Beyond the Myth movie last night, which was a total tear jerker, I it was really awful to watch and so difficult.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was truly in tears last night watching it. So, you know, this is a really difficult decision. And in all of the research I've done, in everything that I have looked into, I keep saying the same thing, which is I need to have some there has to be some factual difference.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There has to be a factual change that would make me change my vote in some way. And at the end of the day, that factual change just hasn't come in in District five. The number one complaint that we receive when it comes to animals is off leash dogs in parks, and that is managed by parks and Rec'",
        "'speaker_6': '. And there are 20 Parks and Rec rangers who manage that during the off season and 50 who manage it during the season. And they are not planning on asking for more in support of that. And it's not enough right now based on the number of of complaints that we receive.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, you know, unfortunately, as much as I feel for, you know, all of the pit bull owners in the city, and as much as I hear you guys and as much as I hear you on breed specific legislation not working, this law is still breed specific legislation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think that, you know, given that the mayor has vetoed this and given that the community has, it doesn't seem that far apart. Right. The the the advocates for this and the people who are really concerned about it, the bridge the gap between you, it seems like it's not that far apart, like there's a real possibility'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to find some consensus here in our community. And so I think that the real solution here is to send it to the community and to have a real community discussion about this, because I think that we could come to something even better than what we have come up with at this point.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think that the real solution here is to let the community use its voice to, you know, send it to the ballot. We don't have to send it to the ballot if the community can between now and November, come to some sort of consensus that makes sense and bring it back as an ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let's do it. Let's do it and let's put it on the ballot as a backup if we need to. But I think that that's where this needs to go from here based on where we are right now. So thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, community and two council members for everything and all of this important discussion'",
        "'speaker_6': 'over the last couple of weeks. I think we will eventually come to a better place as a community, although we're not there right now. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I just want to check in with you. That last one was comments or doing questions. Comments together give you one more chance as the making the motion. Did you want to go or you want to wait?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Did you want to wait? President, I appreciate. Thank you, Councilman Sawyer. And all the I see we got a few council members in the queue. I just want to explain why. I was at a community meeting and someone said to me, you know, why are you doing this now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my response back was, we should have been doing this years ago, because here and when you're having these conversations, no matter what side of the aisle you're on, you can find facts to support your opinion. And so I want to take away dog bite numbers because those numbers are one, you don't know if that's an actual'",
        "'speaker_7': 'breed. And it's just it's really ineffective. But I think here are some facts that people can't argue with. So if you look nationally, subject matter experts, organizations that deal with animals have come out in force overwhelmingly to say that breed specific legislation doesn't work, and I'll just name a few of them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The American Animal Health Association. The American Bar Association. The American Dog Owners Association. The American Kennel Club. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The American Veterinary Medical Association. The American Veterinarian Society of Animal Behavior Association of Professional Dog Trainers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Humane Society of the United States. International Association of Canine Professionals. National Association. Control Associate National Animal excuse me. Control Association. National Canine Research Council. Any Obama Administration 2013. So and I'll just quote a couple of paragraphs from the Obama administration.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't support breed specific legislation. Research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources. They later conclude that as an alternative to breed specific policies, the CDC recommends a community based approach to prevent dog bites.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And ultimately, we think there's a much more promising way to build stronger communities of pets and pets owners. But let's say for a second, you just don't believe those national organizations. Okay, fine. What are other cities doing? Since 2012, cities large and small have repealed their breed specific legislation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Cincinnati, Ohio. 2012. Halsey, Missouri. 2014. Montreal, Canada. 2018. Castle Rock, Colorado 2018. Yakima, Washington 2018. Prairie Villa Candies 2020. Junction City, Kansas. Last week, 2020, there was an article that came out that Aurora is considering repealing their pit bull legislation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I read that being from Kansas City, Missouri, the state of Missouri is going to consider doing it. So if you don't believe the national organization, so be it. Look at some cities like size it in smaller that are doing it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm not aware of any city that has since repealed their breed specific legislation that they have turned around and said, whoops, we made a mistake and if you find one, please let me know because I'm still trying to do my research.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if you don't believe national organizations, you don't believe other cities. What is happening here at the state and city? We've had experts since this since this conversation became public that came to committee. Dr. April Steele, Denver, Dumb Friendly AG from the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Dr. Ariel Fagan, who's a veterinary behaviorist, one of two people in the state who have that certification. We heard from one expert today. Thank you, sir, for coming this year. They're all saying the same story. Breed specific legislation doesn't work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These dogs do not bite at greater offenses in others. The severity Dr. Fagan was here is not as a greater offense than others. So if you have these three, three different levels of experts, okay, so now I'm going to get into some data, but how about some data that comes right here from the heart of heart of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Denver? Denver. Department of Public Health and the Environment. The decade study of all the dog bites that they had, 4.4%, I believe that was percent was from pit bulls, 4.4%. So I'm getting to a point where I'm running out of sources, large and small, to say this is why we should be doing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you know what? I still hear you for the communities in Montebello that have concerns about walking from the individuals that have concerns, because what we have before you, I don't believe, is an outright repeal. We may disagree on that, but we're telling these dog owners that you have to go above and beyond than what a regular'",
        "'speaker_7': 'dog owner like myself has is a way to find a middle ground. Take that new data in two years. Let's come back and see what that looks like. I cannot think of a better approach that we can hear from both sides of the issue and then say, This is why I'm doing this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'These are the reasons behind it. I've reached out to Parks and Rec and they they request Parks Rangers every year in the budget process. Sometimes they get them. Sometimes it's not we as the authority, we approve the budget.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if we had issues with the number of park rangers that are in the budget, then let's make sure seven or nine of us agree to add more park rangers to deal with these dogs. Denver Animal Protection. Should this move forward, have the ability they're going to get to full after fees to help move forward with this'",
        "'speaker_7': 'because remember this doesn't take effect for 90 days because we. You need to have a ramp up period. We do need to have a community engagement period. So this is why I believe that this was the right decision to move forward a compromise.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And while I respect the mayor's opinion, I have just listed a ton of resources and subject matter experts. And I have to admit I'm disappointed because there are not this entire conversation, not one time to the third floor, come to me and say, let's have a conversation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Multiple colleagues on this chamber came to me say, Hey, Chris, I have a conversation about a spay and neuter. I have a conversation. I have a concern about the five years. That's how the process should work, not just have the bill come to your desk and sign a veto five days later.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what the most disappointing about it. Not that he vetoed it. He has that authority. He has that ability. But I would have preferred to have a conversation with him so that we don't have to come now and decide whether or not we're going to override the mayor's veto.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's why I'm moving forward. That's why I'm asking for this vote to override the mayor's veto. If this is not if this is not successful, I will certainly have more conversations with my colleagues. I don't think we should do a ballot measure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think this body, the majority elected by the city and county of the people of Denver, a majority of us felt this way. That's what we should move forward. But, you know, I believe strongly from all the reasons that I just listed why this is the direction to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I would ask my colleagues to consider. But if not, we'll certainly look at other ways to take these dogs out of the shadows and make our community safer with a more responsible dog ordinance. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank, Governor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ladies and gentlemen, I will ask, as I asked last time, and I really appreciate it, I held this up as a shining example of how our democracy can work. We are trying to get through lots of people. This is very emotional on both sides.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is not a competition for who can cheer louder or who can make the other side feel like their thoughts and their feelings are not as valid because they're not cheering as loud. I will ask you to hold your applause, so hold that in check while we go through this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This has been a very difficult and very emotional process for people on both sides, and that does not help. So I will ask you this one time, please keep those. You're cheering the noise down in this chamber while we go through our democratic process and allow everyone in this room, whether they're sitting up here and having to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'voice that in front of all of you, knowing that they're disappointing a lot of people in the room, no matter what they say or if they're sitting in here feeling very emotional right now about a pet that is family to them or a family member who they're worried about, that this is a safe place for our democracy'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to work and for everyone to feel. So I would ask that you please keep that down. Council member can each.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pardon my voice. Next up, Kathleen Flynn. Where you first? Did you get skeptics? When I was actually. I will defer to Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, sorry about that. I'd had Kenny. Councilman Flynn, you are correct. I'm sorry. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Given the last couple of speakers, I had a chance to talk with a number of constituents in my district on both sides, and it's apparent that an override vote will fail. It will. It would fail 8 to 5 if we put it to roll call right now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that means the bill would die. I know that there is an effort by folks on both sides. Paul I emailed with Paul Brandus to try to work on, try to get the communities together to work on something that they could then bring back to us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In light of that. Mr. President, I would like to move on to Rule 6.3. That item 20 dash 71 be referred to committee with the possible outcome that would be referred to the ballot, but invite the community to participate in that and reframe it and not let this bill die right now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am looking at our table over there with legal and ah, Madam Secretary, for some guidance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under Rule 6.3, that motion takes precedence. We have two lawyers checking on me now.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But. I know that. Excuse me. Kirsten Crawford, Legislative Council. Councilman Flynn, that is not my reading of the rules. I think the motion that is standing takes precedent here and needs to be acted on first.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'May I disagree? Mr. President, the rule says when a question shall be under debate, no other motion shall be entertained except the following procedural motions, which shall take precedence, and ab item F is to re referred to committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That it always takes precedence.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our read on it is that as 7.8 special parliamentary role and as such, we are given only three options to do anything regarding Rule 7.8. So we have to operate under 7.8.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. I'm going to go I'm going to continue on for a second. I see that our legal has given us a determination. That's what they're there for. So I'm going to move on to our next speaker and councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You can if you would like to go over there and chat with them, then you can. Councilmember, connect your next up in the queue. Are you ready?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Pardon my voice. I wanted to I didn't speak last week about my vote in favor of the ordinance, and so I will be voting to override the veto tonight if that vote proceeds. So just wanted to put on the record, I think the main reason why in noting the mayor's letter, he he'",
        "'speaker_6': 'mentions the low rate of licensure in the city. And that was the question we at council asked at several points. And what was very clearly laid out during the public hearing last last I guess it wasn't last week last time when that when that public hearing took place was that the process for licensure in this ordinance is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'totally different, that in this case there will be a summons to court issued to someone, and if they fail to do the licensure, there will be a home visit to go and take action with the dogs. So that I think I don't know if the mayor was briefed on the very different follow up procedures that were described'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to us last week. But that, in my opinion, is very factually different information. So we we all many of us had that same question, but we had a very thorough explanation that in this case, we do have very strict follow up and very strong assurances that any individual will license their dog because they will have both a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'court summons in a home visit. Neither of those things occur with a standard license today. So in my opinion, the mayor's letter does not adequately reference the record or the process that it was established under this ordinance and his veto message.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm disappointed that he missed that. And in his message, I believe that is the persuasive difference. I will I could call up the department and asked him this question, but I know what the answer would be. Can we guarantee that under the law we have in place now that no one will be hurt by a verbal'",
        "'speaker_6': '. Well, no, because it has happened. Pit bull bites have happened in our city under the ban. So when folks say to me the ban works, I disagree, it's not working. There are bites that occur. So if that's the case, again, the second piece of the mayor's message is that we are safer with the ban than we would'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be with this alternative approach, given the fact that there will be court summonses in person evaluations of the dog's breed. If a dog is evaluated for their breed, they will be seen by someone. And if they are aggressive during that l'valuation, that information can be taken into account and an action plan can be put into place.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so, in my opinion, I don't I don't believe the evidence points to less safety. I believe it points to more. I can't say to the community that if I if I say no to override his veto, that you're somehow safe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a false sense of security. So in my opinion, I have to go with both the procedural rigor that will be put in place with this ordinance that was not that was not properly documented in the mayor's letter.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then, secondly, the fact that the current ban has not been able to guarantee the safety that our community seeks. I don't know that any community can guarantee safety in either case, but I believe we maximize it with dogs being seen with court summonses and the follow up that occurs far, so far more so than we do'",
        "'speaker_6': 'now. So I will be voting to override the veto tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, will be voting to override the veto and partly because of the d d e information, but also the University of Denver did a study here in Denver that was just Denver came out in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and it also talked about the the the ill effects of BSL. It talked about the economic impact of initiating the breed ban of over $100 million we talked about we've also heard sorry, we've also learned about bite strength and how pit bulls are not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'They have the strongest bite strength that there are many breeds that have stronger bites than than the breeds colloquially identified as pit bulls. BSL negatively impacts service animals, including port those right here. BSL creates a false sense of security because it makes people feel safe because the city has gotten rid of all the bad breeds.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But in reality there are still unsafe dogs that are labs that are huskies that are causing are golden retrievers and German shepherds that are still going around our city. So that gives us a false sense of security. The also, what about all of the groups that Councilman Herndon mentioned that are against BSL and then the 20% statistic'",
        "'speaker_10': 'or 18% currently 0% of pit bulls are registered in Denver. They're pit bulls in my building. They're pit bulls on my block. They're pit bulls in my neighborhood. They're all over. And this would create a legal. For pit bull owners to register their dogs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In other words, if you take zero and add one, then we're getting a better a better approach than if we have them hide in the shadows. I'm assuming that there would be more than one pit bull registered in the city of Denver, but it creates a legal path for people to register their dogs.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And and I think that that's important. And then finally, some of the language used in the mayor's veto like the risk to severe injury or make our neighborhoods safer or the risk to public safety. I hope we think about that in everything we do.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let's ban all cars in Denver. So the pedestrians don't have to fear for their safety. You know, to me, as a pedestrian, I don't have to worry about getting hit and killed by cars. That would reduce traffic fatalities by more than 90% in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, let's ban all oil and gas in the city of Denver because we're seriously worried about climate change. And that would and I'm I'm afraid of it. And and it is against public safety. And so I think that there are a lot of things that we could do in addition to overturning BSL that would fit within the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'mayor's spirit of the ban and or excuse me, of the veto. But but I will be voting to overturn the veto. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, President Clark. I have been talking with a lot of folks in my neighborhood. I've lived in the Monticello community for over 25 years. Montebello is the only community that I have ever seen across the country, in the city and county of Denver, that our residents walk with sticks, with golf clubs, with broomsticks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Grown men and women who walk to protect themselves against dogs in our neighborhood. I agree with my colleagues. We should have been doing this years ago, but we should have been doing education and outreach. How are you, a responsible dog owner?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What does that look like? How do you take care of your dog, especially if it's a member of your family, which a pet should be? How do you socialize it? How do you make sure that it has immunizations, vaccinations, microchipping?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The due study mentioned a lot of great indicators to bring in revenue to our city. I have never seen a dog groomer come out to our neighborhood, Montebello or Green Valley Ranch, to throw a free seminar to make sure that folks who are maybe struggling to stay in our city financially but have a pet to make sure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that they have some emotional support and help for them. I've never seen those resources. I've never seen dog groomers, veterinarians, other than what has been provided by the city boarding dog trainers. This should have been done years ago, but we need help from the industry, from professional associations, expecting a community that for decades folks have had dogs'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for protection. To all of a sudden flip on a dime and say, oh yeah, sure, repeal it. Whatever parameters you have in wool, believe that that's going to work when we don't have more than 20% of our population currently in Denver registering their pets, how do we start to drive up that registration and then also offering microchipping'",
        "'speaker_5': 'vaccination, vet care, dog training classes? We need those resources. I was elected to protect the citizens of Denver to make sure that their welfare was taken care of. And I don't see any way that the way that this ordinance is written.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That I can support it. And beyond that. We need to make sure that we're talking to the very citizens who walk with sticks, golf clubs. Broomsticks to protect themselves. If you haven't been to our community, if you haven't talked to residents, you don't know and you don't understand.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I would ask that this huge community, please come forward and be part of the solution. And if this is going to become a ballot referral, if this is going to be referred back to committee, I would ask that you allow community members to share their perspectives and their ideas to amend this legislation so that we'",

But right now, at this point in time, I don't see us with a path forward around compliance and enforcement to ensure that the community members in my neighborhood are going to'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Clerk Thank Council Member Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, we've all received lots of emails, phone calls, communication from from folks on both sides of this issue. And I want to thank everybody for reaching out and sharing all of their information.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The reason I will not be voting for this override tonight is because, number one, this is an unfunded mandate that is not in our 2020 budget. We heard at the public hearing that there would be a need for two additional staff people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't think that is sufficient to deal with enforcement of the current ordinance. There was no public outreach for my question in the answer earlier. When we all engage in something that has citywide implications. We all expect of one another to do broad community outreach, and that didn't happen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There was an advocacy group involved that, I guess convince Councilman Herndon that this was the right time and the right issue to bring forward. But typically, we have conversations with inner neighborhood cooperation, which represents all of our registered neighborhood organizations across the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'None of that happened. And I think for anything different to be brought before this body, it requires much, much broader input from our community on trying to find any kind of solution that deals with our current ordinance before I think we expand it to look at anything beyond that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All the data that I looked at and we all were inundated with data and I got a list, you know, that I can read off as well. It's a full page of of citations that show that, you know, this isn't just about dog bites, this is about Mullings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's the difference between this breed specific and all of the data. And I can read through them, if you want to hear them, show that this specific breed causes far more harm, especially to children, because children can't get away.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They can't climb and jump a fence like in a video that I saw or a man ran on top of a fence to protect himself, and he stayed perched on top of this tall fence until the owner was able to pull its dog down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And this was a pit bull dog. A children, small children can't get away like that. Approximately a thousand citizens in the U.S. and a thousand cities in the U.S. and 50 countries have freed specific legislation. Less than 2% pet owners have obtained license.'",
        "'speaker_8': '20%, sorry, in in the city of Denver in 2009, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps banned dangerous dog breeds from privatized housing domestically and abroad. And in 2012, the U.S. Air Force enacted a similar uniform policy.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe that in the last 30 years this has worked because we have not seen a death. From pit bulls in this city. Do they exist in our city? We know that people people have them illegally in our city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, obviously, we're being lobbied to try to allow them back in. And here's the reality. We're spending more time on this issue than we've actually been spending in addressing a serious issue going on in this city of homelessness, where we actually have people dying in our streets from exposure that are sleeping outside, which is critical'",
        "'speaker_8': '. And this is an issue that I would love to see you all engaged in as well, and as passionately as you are about your animals. I'm not going to read through the list of citations. I do want to read a statement from an ER doctor from Children's Hospital that has worked in seven regions in the past 16'",

Children with missing body parts faces, severe brain and head injuries. Some of who were near death from pit bull attacks. The bites from shit shoes and Chihuahuas are nothing compared to the severity of injuries occurred from pit bull breeds.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She goes on to just talk about the impact to two children, especially so. I think, again, if this is something that the votes are there to have a broader conversation, I'm happy to be part of that conversation. But I believe we've got to deal with today's ordinance and look at how we address some of the vicious dogs'",
        "'speaker_8': '. You know, and it's not just pit bulls, it's other animals that run loose. We have people throughout my neighborhood who never have their dogs on a leash. You know, that's kind of what our our dog park survived. Right.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we've got more dog parts in this city than we've ever had. So I think these are issues that we need to work with and address. And I personally want to thank the mayor for vetoing this because there's much, much more work that needs to be done on this before I would be ready to vote for approving'",
        "'speaker_8': 'something that I think, again, this this ordinance has protected for the last 30 years. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Can you hear me? Thank you, Mr. President. Our office received 3000 replies in regard to this legislation. 411 came specifically from our district, and they were supporting. 385 were supporting the veto. While I personally believe that this effort in particular is breed specific policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I. I've heard over and over that breed specific policy does not work. I will be supporting an override of the mayor's veto. I do encourage people involved in this effort to really consider the fact that this is breed specific policy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And if we do put something to the voters, I would recommend a full repeal. I think that we have to recognize that this kind of legislation was designed to target people of color. The mayor's decision is really an illustration of his disrespect for council's power.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And in a heavy mayoral control city, it's very important to take note of when this is done and what it's done for. And the language that was used in the justification for this veto is incredibly problematic, along for many of the reasons stated by Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that if we are making policy that is specific to exceptions to the rule or one incident and not making policy around things that we know have wild implications on our health and safety, that's problematic and backwards.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I also think it's important to continue fighting for the repeal, but also recognizing that we need to test our mayor's commitment to public health and safety. If the mayor does believe that he cannot in good conscience sign this bill because of the potential life that would be lost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we need to hold him to that. When we talk about other repeals and so we are all fighting for a repeal of a ban on humans in this city, a ban on impoverished humans. And I cannot imagine that the mayor's veto justification will be acceptable in that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I encourage you all to stay involved, to recognize that the use of a veto and the need for a supermajority always silences the minority. And that is something that transcends this moment and this issue. And we need all of you to stay engaged, to stay active, and recognize that if you're not happy with how people'",
        "'speaker_2': 'up here are voting, you need to be involved at the local government level to making sure that people up here are listening to you all. So stay tuned because I know everyone wants to leave after this issue. If you're here for pit bulls.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember. Councilmember Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I was going to play a hand raising game, but I'll say this all the time and let you know what my observation has been over these past two weeks of hearings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think a large.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Number.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Of people who are here in support of overturning the pit bull ban, which I don't think is an unreasonable position. I think either we're not living in Denver in the mid 1980s or we're very young. And it's not that if you're young, you're not bright.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what my belief is that a large number of people who object to the pit bull ban were older in the mid 1980s. And I disagree with my colleague. I don't believe this ban was put into place, had anything to do with with putting down communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We had a real problem in the mid eighties. The attorney who wrote the ban spoke of 20 incidents of severe attacks which are animal protection officer was was not familiar enough with to be able to dispute we had a serious problem here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so that's where that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Ban came from. I've seen all the lists of all the cities across the country that have overturned the bans. The vast majority of them, the vast majority of them are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Nowhere near.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As large city as Denver. Some are, but the vast majority I had one proponent of overturning the ban. Send me a list I think was like 67 cities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of them was Denver size.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The vast majority are small areas. Why does that matter to me? Okay, we're 720,000 people in this city. There are tens of thousands of of devoted, wonderful dog owners. In a city this size, there are going to be hundreds, if not thousands of irresponsible bad dog owners.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. With promises of a more aggressive licensing system and promises of more aggressive public information and training. My preference is I'd like to see those numbers of registrations go up. First, I'd like to see a public relations campaign and education campaign on responsible ownership.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First, I told Councilman Herndon last week, I. Can't imagine that there's not a path forward with this. My preference would be to see it go to the ballot to see what really is the community will on something like this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What else? Yeah, that's. As I said, I mean, I was here in the eighties. I was a journalist at the time. And I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Remember.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The concern in the city. It was real.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That. The. The. Vast majority of. Animal rights organizations talk against breed specific legislation. Again, that makes sense to me. But we have as I'm not talking about studies and where do you got 103 million? I don't know that I care about the dollars.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's about public safety. But I think we have work to do first. This is a real city with a real number of people, with real issues to be faced first.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to start by saying thank you to everyone who's sitting here and thank you for having reflective democracy. I know this is an emotional topic, and I too, would hope that this goes to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that it's our job often to send things to the ballot. I think that's what we have elections for, is so that things don't go on the ballot. But in this particular instance, it is a really emotional topic.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the fact that there's more dogs in Denver than there are kids in DPS schools right now is obviously is a main concern. And so for me, when we are updating our schools, we go to the ballot because they are our kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So obviously we mean it. Maybe need to change that and have dog issues go to the ballot because they're so emotional. So with that, I will not be changing my vote from how I voted two weeks ago. But I do agree with the fact that this should go to the ballot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. All right. As I'm not seeing any other comments. So first, I'll say thank you to all of you. Thank you for, you know, listening to my plea. And I appreciate once again you creating a safe space for democracy to flourish on a really, really tough issue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I will not go in depth because I said my piece last week or two weeks ago. I echo a lot of what Councilman Herndon, Councilman Kennedy, Councilman Hines and others have said that because I was going down my checklist as they were got there, got to a lot of the stuff that I was going to say.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So instead, I will just say this before we vote. I am disappointed that the the mayor decided, although well within his purview to veto this and veto a majority will on the council and my plea back to the third floor, because it does not look as if this is going to have the votes tonight for us to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'override that veto is twofold is number one, everything that's in that letter about public safety, we have people walking around Montebello today with this legislation in place carrying things to protect themselves from dogs. If if this mayor is serious and I believe that he is from his words in his letter about public safety when it comes to'",
        "'speaker_0': 'dogs, then resources have to be deployed immediately to address that. This this legislation staying in place is not making. That community safe or safer. That is a problem right now under this legislation. And just simply by vetoing our legislation, which I do believe makes us a safer community, does not solve that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So those resources need to be deployed immediately. Also, we had two different experts last week testify about the inaccuracy of identifying dogs that have the blood that this veto seems to imply. They cannot escape the genetics that they cannot escape.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And yet we had experts say that when scientifically tested on whether you can visually identify the genes in a dog, it is inaccurate. 75% of the time, it is completely and totally irresponsible for this city to continue to uphold something that I believe is not based on science, but to at least say what we believe and going'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to take a stand with a veto. That the science says that if it has this gene, if it has this blood, then it's dangerous. And then to potentially be turning 75% of dogs that do not have that blood and do not have that gene.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And telling dog owners that they cannot keep their family member, their pet based on a visual identification, that is wrong. At a minimum, we need to deploy immediately the resources to test genetically. Every single dog that this city is saying does not belong based on this legislation until a point where we are confident that our system somehow'",
        "'speaker_0': 'outcompete the other systems that have been scientifically tested. And we can 100% of the time identify this evil gene that somehow exists or we need to. And if we can prove that our system does that, then we can stop genetically testing, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Otherwise, it is my belief that every dog needs to be genetically test before the city has any authority to ask an owner for that dog to be removed from the city. If it is the intent of this mayor to continue to fight this hard on keeping a piece of legislation that I don't believe works.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But if it is, then at a minimum, resources need to be deployed to keep people safe today. And resources need to be deployed immediately to prove that when a dog is being kicked out of our city and told that it can't be here when it has no history.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have aggressive dog ordinance now that protects our citizens better from dogs of all breeds that are aggressive. But this dog that has no history of any of that being told, you can't be here because you got the wrong genes, you've got the wrong blood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Then we better be sure and be able to show through science that that blood and that gene is in fact in there. Or I believe that is an overstep of the enforcement of this ordinance and should not be allowed with that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Councilmembers This is a reminder that nine affirmative votes of council will be required for the adoption of this motion to override the veto. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And so that is the reason that it is before you. The one piece added was the final one about revisiting the rules as the body changes. The these are designed not to be law, but to guide our processes as a body, as group agreements.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you can't have group agreements to guide our body if the group doesn't agree on them. And so that is simply to put out there that we should be reconvening every time there's a need.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And so I would also be supportive of referring this to committee just to make sure that we have the discussion that, you know, it sounds like we've got a couple amendments, at least one, and I want to make sure that we get it right.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So, you know, I think that there is there's a lot in here that I like, but I am eager to hear from everyone else about these additions of language. And again, I do in this agree with Councilmember Flynn that this is not the easiest or the best place to do that.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Some of you may know who she is, but for those of you who don't. This is Lauren Granato. I began my introduction by leading with the phrase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hold on just a second. We're having a technical difficulty getting the right screen up, so we're not seeing what you're seeing. Okay. So if we could get that fixed.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Some of you may know who Lauren Granado is, but for those of you who don't. This is my mom. I began my introduction by leading with the phrase, I hope this finds you own a piece. I did this because this is what my mother always began of correspondence with, and it's indicative of how she always cared about'",
        "'speaker_11': 'how a person was doing before anything else. Lorraine is the second child of Joan Tilly Granado. She was born April 16th, 1948, in Denver, Colorado.

She earned these two degrees while being a single mom to three boys and working several jobs at the same time, including a stint as a ceramic instructor at Swansea Recreation Center.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The biggest part of Lauren's life is her family. Lorraine's father, Joe Granado, was born in Trinidad, Colorado, to a family of two, a family of farm workers during the Great Depression. They would go farm to farm, picking fruits and vegetables in order to provide for the family.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My mother learned her work ethic and her dedication to family from him. Her mother, Tillie Granado, was born in 1925 in the San Luis Valley on a farm with her two brothers and sisters. Her mother passed away when she was at the age of 12, and at that point she began to care for her siblings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Her family is everything to her, and she is the embodiment of love and of nurturing. My mother learned how to love and how to care for others from her. A story my mother would tell us about this time and how it sparked her passion for equity was when my grandparents were young, they first met, they were on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a date and they were asked to leave a restaurant because they hadn't noticed a sign in the window that said, No, dogs are Mexicans allowed. This taught my mother why she should fight for equity and for justice. As a young woman, Lorraine started her community organizing as a member of the American Friends Service Committee.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This is a Quaker based organization whose mission it is to promote peace and justice for all humans. Her focus at the time was to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons across the globe. She has been nationally recognized for this work, even sitting down with heads of states from other countries to talk about nuclear disarmament.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'A story that she told us when she was on a month long trip across the Middle East. She was having dinner with a number of dignitaries. At one point, Yasser Arafat asked the crowd, Does anyone smoke? My mother raised her hand.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He says to her, Please come sit. Let's talk. My mother was delighted at having such an honor and yet was never intimidated nor afraid. Another event that she organized that had lasting impact was a trip that she organized to take a group of 40 kids from the inner city of denver across the country to washington, d.c. for'",

        "'speaker_11': 'She did this in part because of her adoration for Martin Luther King Jr. And also for his messages of nonviolent protest and change. This inspired and taught these young people about the struggles and hardships suffered through the civil rights movement and how the messages of love and nonviolence reached so many different people from different races, religions and'",

The center was designed to meet the needs of our communities by providing service based programs such as GED classes, ESL programs, access to social services, parenting'",
        "'speaker_11': 'classes, afterschool and leadership programs for youth along with many other opportunities. This was a chance to bring together people from the surrounding neighborhoods to create positive change and provide success through education. One of my favorite quotes of quotes of hers regarding the service to others is if a person speaks only Spanish, well, that's going to limit their'",
        "'speaker_11': 'opportunities here. So let's teach them English. If a person never graduated from high school, they probably won't be able to get a job with decent pay. So we offer GED classes, and when they're done with those, we'll help them get a job.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's always been about, sure, you can do it. And here's the thing. When people know that you believe in them, they start to believe in themselves. This is who Lorraine was. She always said that it's not what you do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is how you do this. This is the reason she is so loved and respected by the people who work with her for her, or were inspired by something she did. She would often tell our staff at the Cross Community Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need to recognize and honor the Spirit of God that lives within us all. If we can help each other while doing this with respect and dignity, then we truly are doing good work. As a part of her fight for justice, she took on the environmental issues that plagued our community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Most notably, she led a group of neighbors who filed a successful class action class action lawsuit against the Asarco smelting company because they had contaminated the groundwater and the soil of the nearby communities. At the time, this was the largest environmental settlement ever awarded in the state of Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The settlement allowed for the soil testing and the remediation of lawns from the nearby communities. It also led to the eventual closure of this plant and launched a new focus of our work environmental justice. In 1995, the Vulcan Chemical Company had a tanker that spilled on the railroad tracks near 52nd in Milwaukee in a residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This released hydrochloric and muriatic acid into the air. Vulcan Chemical did nothing or did not follow the proper processes in notifying or evacuating the surrounding community. And as a result, Lorain led a group of residents who took Vulcan to court over this environmental hazard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'They negotiated a settlement in the amount of $200,000. Lorain then raised the additional moneys that were used to purchase the land and all of the equipment. After designing the park with local neighbors. She then turned the property over to Parks and Recreation to keep as a city park.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Laureen did not like nor craved the attention that came with her success. She always said that it was never her alone that did this work. It was always the good people along the way that made things change for the better.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'However, there were a few. There were two times that she was thrilled to be recognized. You'll see on the slide the top left picture. This is a picture of the human, the Martin Luther King Jr Humanitarian Award that she won in 1997.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'This made her incredibly proud and happy because this was her idol. The second was when she was invited to the White House by Hillary Clinton to celebrate the work that she had done with families and with children. Her legacy continues, as you can see.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'You probably recognize a couple of people, at least from the slide. Antonio Veal. Veal at the top left has been a principal for over ten years here in Denver. Early in his career, he worked for Lorain, the Cross Community Coalition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'He attributes his evolution from a rebellious Let's Start the revolution to the understanding that peaceful conflict resolution has just as much power and more effect than anger or violence. Councilwoman CdeBaca probably said that cross-community coalition made a positive impact on her life and that Lorraine's messages of love, strength and community helped inspire her on her journey.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Romelu Carillo in the top right picture. Is an elder in our community who is the perfect mom and neighbor. And she also says that she found her voice when the rain gave her the opportunity to become a community organizer.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Ernestine Gallegos in the bottom left is a graduate of is a graduate of the leadership in youth programs at the Cross Community Coalition. She is a teacher in the Weld County School District, and she says that she is inspired by learning strength with compassion and the ability to bring groups of diverse people together to make positive change'",
        "'speaker_11': '. In the bottom middle picture, you will see young women of color who come from similar backgrounds as Lorraine and have been inspired to follow in her footsteps. In the middle of that picture, you will see Adriana Garcia. She is Lorraine's granddaughter.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'She is a recent graduate of Arup, a Jesuit high school, and of the Porter Billups Leadership Academy at Regis University. After graduating from college, she wants to open up her own nonprofit, helping families and children. Lastly, you will see a picture of me.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's not impressive. But don't focus on me. Please look at the two young women in the background. I bring them up because I have the best job in the world. I'm the dean of a high school, and while I have no real talent or skill, I get to go to work every single day and I get to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'talk about the lessons and the love and the opportunities that education affords. All of these young people that I work with. I get to talk to Yardley and Fabiola about how they come from very similar circumstance, very humble beginnings.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that through this education, through their compassion, through their hard work, they can recognize and lift up their own communities and their own families. It is all of these voices that continue to allow. Lauren's legacy to live on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it is with that that the Granado family humbly requests your support in naming the park at 52nd Avenue and still street the Lorraine Granado Community Park. Thank you very much progresses.'",

So before I make a couple of personal comments, I wanted to just cover with you the process that we use.'",

So very pleased to do that on their behalf and just in the process, excuse me, of my staff sort of digging up the records of this of this park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And, you know, one sort of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Wondering in our minds, why.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We leave a park with a, you know, a street name, a street corner for so long? And so we were just delighted that this park will contain a name of a woman who really just embodies that neighborhood in so many ways.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She affected my life tremendously. And Paul has talked so much about the love that Lorain had for her community, for the people with whom she worked. I, I, I pointed out in the cab hearing she also had some tough love for for us, often in the community as an activist, she would let our city leaders and our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'community leaders know when she thought they weren't doing what was in the best interests of the community, especially those who were in greatest need. I had an opportunity in her work when I was an aide and to a city council member, and also when I was on City Council to work with Lorain on some of the issues'",
        "'speaker_5': 'around environmental justice in the communities. And she was relentless in her pursuit of justice for her community and for doing the right things, especially for children. I think she lived at the Cross Community Coalition building on the corner of 46th and York, Josephine.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Josephine And it was a place where people were coming and going constantly for her help. And she never said no to anybody that I've ever heard about. And, you know, she she was just in that building all the time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I don't know how you any of you ever saw her, but she she just was such a stalwart and somebody who cared so deeply about her community and and our entire city. So we are very proud to encourage you to vote in favor of this proposal this evening.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I wrote down a couple of notes throughout her entire adult life for the better part of most of her 71 years. She lived within three blocks of this park. She was a resident of this neighborhood for her entire life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That park was just an open field of weeds and debris near to an industrial area with a lot of just it was in disrepair. Half of this, the second half of this block is developed and it has businesses there that are fenced off.'",

Knowing that the children in that community did not have the resources to get a costume where they would not go trick'",

        "'speaker_0': 'The things that you do at a park. She wanted that for our community. On the last day that we had her, on the day she passed. After the last trip out of her home, out of her community, we were left with an empty, an emptiness in the home.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I took a walk over to that park with my dog. Not a pit bull, but a great dog nonetheless. And out of the trailer park came a father.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'So after that, I discharged. I've been out for over ten years and working for the same company for 17, and she's put a lot of positive into my life just from being in the same neighborhood. And I'm one of those ones that you can say, I made it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I have two kids that I sent to school. They both graduated because they had the homework help hotline that Paul in them always provided with cross-community coalition. I have two kids now. One's three, one's three months old, and I hope I can do the same thing for them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Give them the love and support that they need. Because I never had a father or mother, but Lorraine showed me that it was time to move on and take care of that. So. I've been a part as long as you my whole life.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I live down the street from that park, and like Jimmy said, it was just a field. People would drop off their stolen cars there, strip them down, whatever, whatever. And she's changed that. Now it's a park. Now you can go play kids there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'll take my kids there any day of the week. But she deserves that. And just to let you know. She's a good person. She's taken care of a lot of people in that neighborhood. So thank you. Thank you.'",

I shouldn't be on the board. Lorain response. Lorraine's response was, You are a good person to be on the board because when you talk, it is important and it needs to be heard'",
        "'speaker_8': '. When you talk, it makes sense. This trust that my mom felt for her, gave my mom the confidence and courage to become a member of the board. And then she continued to do numerous other volunteer work in our community, going out to people's homes and informing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'People about different things. My mom went on to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So many things and for me as a young person, a very timid mother. For her to see this change as a young person, it was very.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Important for me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a young person to see that that conflict isn't something that you run from, but it's something you work through for your community. And I when I was working there, I told my dad one day, I want to I want to work at a nonprofit.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want to I want to make my own nonprofit like Cross Community. And my dad at that time said, you know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You wanted to be the first Mexican-American president.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then then you were going to be a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Doctor, then you're going.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To be a teacher, and now you're going to be nonprofit. The money is getting less and less. And so I said, okay, I'll be a teacher. And when I retire, that's still my goal.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Consider her for the party.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. And we had a few technology glitches. I just want to make sure that we got to everybody who signed up to speak. Yes, you miss anyway. Okay. All right. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council members, anyone?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, no question. Council woman ORTEGA.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to just ask Manager Haynes. The part of the PowerPoint said that the park had been designated or dedicated. But I'm trying to find out. Has it officially been dedicated?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, it has. It is an official park in our park system, Councilwoman Ortega. And if I may, Mr. President, it was mentioned in one of the stories sorry, I'm having a hard time. I was emotional or it was mentioned that, um, I think her son said that the kid who visited might never know who it was that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'made that park possible. Well, part of this proposal in naming this park is to do just that and to make sure that every kid and every family who visits that Parks knows exactly who was responsible for that park being there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, uh, later this spring, when we finally get out of this season of snowing every other day, we do plan to have a dedication ceremony for the naming for the new sign that will be at that park. We will have interpretive signage that will share some of Lorraine's story so that future families and children who visit the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'park will know, in fact, who made it possible for that park to be there to serve that community. So we will invite all of you and we'll let you know when that occurs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And one last question. This is about the process. You talked about that a little bit, but I think for my colleagues, knowing that Parks and Rec has a three year, normally three years that someone has to have passed before a park could be named after them.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'If you could just explain how this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, our policy does require under ordinary circumstances that a person will have been deceased for a minimum of three years before a naming proposal would be accepted. But there is an exception to that part of the proposal for individuals who contribute to so a gift that if the meter exceeds half of the value of the park or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the facility is considered acceptable for a naming. And I will as you heard from Paul and as we certainly found in our in our records, both the acquisition and the development of the park would not have occurred. But for Lorraine Granado, she she secured all the funding.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'She secured some of the funding from some of the settlement, from the in the cases of contamination in that community and directed all of them to this project and then led it to make sure that it got designed and built and worked with the city planners at that time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So her proposal comes under that section of the naming proposal. Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Coulson. Right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Director. Good. Two related questions. The first, why does someone why should someone be deceased? And then second, was there a thought behind the number three or was that like, why three years?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Councilman, this this notion that. A park should be named for someone of a substantial note in the community and that the and it was this was a long standing policy and thinking for a long time was that a person's legacy is often not fully established until well after they are gone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And then and that that sort of when a community feels so strongly about a person's legacy after that period of time, then it really, truly is someone who has a lasting legacy. That policy originally called for seven years, and so for many years a person had to be deceased for seven years before a proposal would be considered'",
        "'speaker_5': '. The Parks and Rec Advisory Board took that issue up in 2017, I believe, and decided that that it was more reasonable a three year period would be more reasonable. And so that was that that was the thinking of the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Advisory board at the time.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Great. Thank you, Director Higgins. And thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. All right, so no other questions. Public hearing for counsel Bill 88 is closed. Comments by Members of Council Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Lorraine was a neighbor, a revolutionary mother, a freedom fighter, an environmental justice warrior, and an overall Denver hero. This is a full circle moment for me. Lorraine came back to our community when the year that I was born.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm a fifth generation resident of Swansea and a product of the movement that she built. Lorraine gave us this park among so many other things, and we don't always get to honor those from our community who have sacrificed blood, sweat, tears and community and family for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When Happy made the comment about her family seeing her often. I recognize the sacrifice that you all made for her to give to our community what she gave us. And I thank all of you for that. Because to have someone be a mother to a community means that you have to share her.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you all indeed shared her. And I thank you for it. And I'm committed to making sure that I share my life with my community in the same way. Lorraine was one of the first environmental justice warriors of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Before we even had a name for it, Lorraine was fighting against environmental racism with her fight and the identification of the Superfund site and consequent cleanup. She made a healthier place not just for our community, but for the top housing market in the country.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This would not have been possible if she had not cleaned up our neighborhood to the degree that made it livable. She started an organization that became home to so many future organizations. She paved the way for future leaders, including myself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She taught me how to be a leader before she taught me how to be an organizer, before I even knew what organizing or issue based advocacy was. And she did that. The way Ernestine A shared she did. She.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She taught you. She saw your strength and helped you elevate your strength. She helped you strengthen and refine who you were. I was six years old when Lorraine was passing out fliers to neighborhood kids to turn us into block captains so that we could get our fliers to our different houses in our neighborhood to tell our parents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that they could get their yards cleaned up. I didn't know at that time that I was becoming a community organizer. The home that she created for cross-community coalition the first time was so much more than an environmental justice organization for kids like me who didn't have a computer to do my homework on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lorraine allowed me a space to come in and to type all night. She'd leave the door, she'd lock the door and let me stay there, typing my homework, my papers. And she trusted us. And she gave us that foundation we needed to build something and to become something.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But she taught us how to come back to our community. And I think that's the most important thing that she instilled in all of us, was to come back to our community and give our community what others had given us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so naming this park is not only a reminder of who Lorraine was and the legacy she left to us, but also a reclamation, a symbol of reclaiming our neighborhood. And what and a reminder that we could do what she did.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By just showing that love and pushing through conflict to tell our community that they're worth it and show them how to claim it. So thank you all for going through this. Thank you. Happy for making the exception to do this differently because of her contribution.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It means so much to me and I hope that we plan her the the park naming on her birthday. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm going to try to get through this. First of all. Lorraine was my friend. You couldn't work with her and not end up being an amazing friend to her because of. Just the incredible work that she did in this in this community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And Cross-community Coalition was an organization that brought those three communities together as one community. Everybody saw Globeville, Elyria and Swansea as one neighborhood. I'm not sure that people see it that way these days, but she was that unifier.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She was that one catalyst in the community who could walk into all three of these neighborhoods and not be seen as, Oh, wait a minute, you can't tell us what to do. You're from you're from over there. No, she brought all these communities together and the role that she played.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She was the catalyst who helped find the attorney that then filed the lawsuit against Asarco and and really kind of forced the cleanup that was being negotiated between Asarco and the state to be done at a much, much deeper level than what was being proposed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And again, it was the largest property damage settlement case in the state that resulted in the residents who lived in Globeville, whose properties were were harmed from the heavy metals from Asarco, to actually get some some benefit from all of that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can remember being a staff person to sell Carpio and having to go out to meetings in the neighborhoods. And every single time I would get lost. You know, I mean, we didn't have MapQuest back then, right? So I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I learned all the back roads, you know, and over time, I was able to maneuver through all the back roads when people would be stuck on I-70. But you look at what's going on today in these poor neighborhoods are just being inundated with so much, so much impact from the construction, so much impact from gentrification that's been'",
        "'speaker_8': 'happening. And and I really I miss her so much because. She would be in the trenches making sure that the community as a whole was organized and was doing everything possible to address what's going on there today, not just what's happened in the past, but what's what's going on there today.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I just I just can't tell you how much I loved Lorraine, because she did so much for these communities in her work at Cross Community, all the programs that Councilwoman CdeBaca and her family talked about. I spent so many times there at the at cross community for different meetings and in working on on so many of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'the things that were happening there. And this park is so symbolic of. Showing the love she had for her own community and the work she put in to making sure that those natural resource damage funds could have gone to anything.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It could have gone to programs across community. But I think it had to go towards some land use benefit. And what better place than across the street from a trailer park? We're very, very low income families with lots of small children reside and had no place else to go because those parents were not going to let their'",
        "'speaker_8': 'kids loose to go blocks away over to Swansea, a rec center or Swansea a park. They would they would let them play in the field across the street that didn't have the improvements. So now having that park with those improvements to benefit those kids is is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With her name on there and with information about who she was and what her contributions were to the community. I can't think of a better way. And the reason it is so important that that is a dedicated park is that that park will remain there forever unless the voters ever decide that property needs to be sold.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that legacy, her legacy and her contributions will remain there for years and years into the future. And I am honored to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So I just want to start by saying thank you to the family. Not so long ago, my father passed away and I had to stand up in front of a group of people and ask for a high school to be named after the person of high school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I remember breaking down and crying and having to say talk myself in my head that it was okay to show emotion, even though sometimes in the Latino community it's better not to cry. So you did it with such dignity.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All of you would. And our ancestors never leave us. Right? We stand on their shoulders. And she is here with you today. And she is standing in heaven, smiling down at you with such honor and pride, how you recognized her and how you spoke to her, and how passionately you all talked.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that is something that death can never take away from all of you, is that connection. So I will just start with that. And I just her work changed forever. I have friends who grew up in Globeville, Elyria and Swansea, and they have all the girls have lupus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And there's I have friends who have died of cancer who have grown up in global or in Swansea. I have cousins who live there who are very sick and your mom and the Asarco ran the Superfund site, changed their lives, and people can have gardens without being scared and people can have a different way of life.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you so much for that. And with the naming of this, as Councilman Ortega said, it will forever be here and it will forever be told. And one day, many generations from now, someone's going to say, who is that person?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And they're going to probably have Google and be able to Google it really easily. And I wrote down the quote, It's not what you do. It's how you do it. And I will remember that as a council member, because sometimes I miss my dad so much up here that I have a hard time personally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I miss his guidance. And so I know all of you and this whole community, I'm sure, miss her guidance and I will honor those words with me as I move through this journey of it's not what I do, it's how I do it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you all. And it will be my honor to vote yes in favor of this naming.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Torres.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. And thank you to the family for coming out. And thank you for introducing me to your mom. I really appreciate that. And I look forward to sharing who she was and what her legacy is with my West Side community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to say to the family and to the folks who might be watching that one of the most amazing things that I've discovered about serving in this role, and I know that every member up here will feel this is the opportunity to memorialize great people who have done great things for Denver, people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that we knew in the flesh. You are now gone, but need to be remembered as the family. So very well said and very emotionally. I could feel that. And it was my I was honored to know your mother through my work at the newspaper over the years with the Asarco lawsuit and with the her push to relocate'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I-70 up north of the stock show and all sorts of of efforts and how she was a great fighter for the community. And so I wanted to share what the Councilwoman Ortega said about her. And it is just an honor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's humbling to know that when we vote tonight, we will make this a permanent memorial. And I love I love what you said about how she converted that dirt lot, that that wasteland into a community park and how people will always remember.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And finally, I think what I want to say is I am just I just think your mother's name, Lorraine Granato, it just strikes me as such a strong, wonderful name. It will never no voters will ever sell that park councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm just honored and humbled to be able to vote yes for for your mother's memory. I think I still have her. I kept my old analog Rolodex from the Rocky Mountain News when you used to put them on little cards on that circular thingy before we put them on computers in the mid eighties.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I call it my analog rolodex. And your mom's name is in there somewhere I might try to find right what I do with that and dig it out and just remember her in a special way. Thank you very much, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I can only hope that I have a sense the impact on my community, as Miss Renato has had on each of you addresses.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, President Clarke. Thank you so much for your amazing words about your mom and grandmother and friend. And she's legendary. I mean, you know what she did to create the park and how she went about that, and especially with the natural resource, the damage funds and really ensuring because those damaged funds don't have to go.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right next to the neighborhood. They can go wherever. And it's a very convoluted process. And following how she moved through that challenge and pulled community together and continued to do so, I want to share with you. So I started a nonprofit called Environmental Learning for Kids over 20 years ago in the Montebello community and with the close'",
        "'speaker_5': 'proximity to the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, it was a Superfund site as well, and there were dam installers. And when we went to the attorney general's office, they were like, No, you don't need the damage funds right next to Montebello.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You don't need to buy any land there. We're going to send them way over across the city. And of course, the folks in Marbella were like, what were the ones closest to that? And so really looking at and studying and and talking with people that worked with her to make that happen was really how we were able'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to, in the Montebello community, secure five and a half acres of land and it's being made into a park and hopefully someday that land will be designated as the Montebello Open space. And so her legacy and what she did continues on not only in your neighborhood but in other neighborhoods throughout the city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I loved it when you shared that, you know, she had Trinidad and San Luis Valley connections. My family is from Trinidad. And and I think that that feeling of a connection to the land and how healing the outdoors and how healing nature is, it's truly a gift that you can give to your community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it sounds like she gave that gift over and over to all of you. And so I just wanted to share that story with you around how her actions reached far and wide beyond the community. And thank you for being here and sharing sharing that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'President Clark. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for your wonderful words. All of you spoke. I did not know you miss Grenada, your mother, your grandmother, your friend. I don't know you, but I feel her through you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I grew up in a family where public service was just something you did, you know? And I remember going over to friends houses whose parents weren't involved in the community at that level. And there would be of, well, you know, Dad works hard or mom's busy and it's like, yeah, we all are, but it's your community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you don't raise it up, who is going to, you know and. I just see that the pride that you all have in that, because I felt that I was pleased that, you know, my dad worked six days a week and found that found time to contribute at night and on weekends.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Mom worked full time and raised a family and she found time. And, you know, as a community, your mom, Canada, will be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Memorialized.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'At this park at 52nd Avenue, but our entire community rises up on the spirits of people like Lorraine Granado. So thank you very much. It is truly an honor. And I am just so I don't know that I'm proud of myself.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm just amazed that I haven't started weeping yet. You very touching words. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Ortega, you back up?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. I just wanted to mention that Lorraine's mother, Tillie, is is still among us. And I'm sure that she wanted to be here tonight. I don't know if she's watching, but I just wanted to make sure that she knew that I appreciate her contributions to raising such an amazing young woman that had so much impact on all'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of us. I remember your grandpa Joe as well, and I would just say that two comments that Councilwoman Gilmore was saying, she touched so many lives across this whole city. Her work with American Friends Service Committee, I mean, she worked with people all across the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that was exemplified by, you know, so many people that came to her service and not only showed their love for Lorraine, but their love for the family. So I just want to, again, thank you all for coming out tonight and for your efforts and really happy, too, to be supporting this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I will just end and then we're going to vote, which is going to be a lot of fun tonight because what a great story. And I just want to echo what a lot of people have said.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And thank you for sharing Lorraine with us tonight. But with the city and you know, and echo what Councilmember Gilmore was talking about with those funds and how hard it is even I mean, never name the battle to get those funds, to get that settlement, but then to get those funds back to something usable in the community'",
        "'speaker_0': '. We had the same thing in the overall neighborhood in my district where there were Shattuck remediation funds. They sat for 25 years before anyone could figure out how to get those dollars out of a bank account and back into something for the community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, I mean, to first take on the battle to win and then to be able to get those dollars right back in into here and into a park. You know, I spent my entire career before this working in parks and connecting kids and families to parks and the power that that has to change a person's life'",
        "'speaker_0': ', that access to some greenspace and some space for community and for exploration and for adventure right in the middle of your neighborhood is so important. And often we will have, you know, a great person who did lots of great things in the city, who were naming a park after does not necessarily even related to that park or'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that piece of land. Here we have an amazing individual who did so many amazing things, but also single handedly handed the city, the property and the park. And getting to name that park after that person is really is really amazing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's really a treat. And again, we're you know, there's a lot of things that we do in this job and you got to maybe see some of it tonight waiting for this. And sorry that it's been such a late night for you, but it's it's moments like this that are really special to be able to be a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'part of your story and be able to cast one of those votes to permanently name this park. And I am excited to do so. So without further ado, Madam Secretary, let's vote.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Black eye.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'See?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'CDEBACA Absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When I.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Hi. Madam Secretary, are we missing one? Okay. Madam Secretary, please close the voting, announce the results. 1111 Eyes Council Bill 88 has passed. Congratulations. Thank you all very much for your responsiveness, Deborah.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My grandmother is at home. She's been watching this on Channel eight. Hi, Grandma.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Grab that microphone so she can hear you.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My grandmother is at home watching and she is still in good health. She is still leading our family. She was my mother's best friend. And so we truly thank all of you for this honor. God bless you all.'"
