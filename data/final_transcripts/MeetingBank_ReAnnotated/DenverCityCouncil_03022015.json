        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to stress 74% of those businesses are local, and this really makes us the best place for local and national shopping. And it's very sad to see Pismo Gallery leave, but it's the case of natural retirement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Some of us I won't say exactly who, but some of us who might be around the same age as Sandy Saadallah realize that when you leave a job you love, it's truly bittersweet. Some of us don't have as much choice about when to quit as others, but I will tell you, I was in the shop today to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'pick up these cherries that came all the way from Italy. And I want you all to have them as collector's items from Cherry Creek. They're a favorite item to purchase in the store, but that store was. So I expected it to see it half empty.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, we're starting the sale. It is so beautiful there still. So what? So much wonderful stuff in there, even some that you can afford that I would suggest right now they're slashing prices by 20 and 30%. And it's just an experience you ought to go in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If you've never been in, it will be your last chance to go in and look around the press release. Sandy puts out talks about how much she really appreciates her staff and the artists she works with. I in there today I saw the staff and there they are going strong, so excited about what's in the gallery that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I feel sort of bad for them. But anyway, I'm very pleased to bring this and I want to wish Sandy and her husband Ed a good time in their retirement.

        "'speaker_1': 'It was so inviting. Today we received a copy of Wingtips and if my colleagues have a copy, you might want to go to page six because 20 years ago this weekend, Ed Saadallah was at the CIA opening the airport.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there you are. You and Adel, what a small world. I'm going to miss you guys. But thank you for for 25 years of what you've done in Cherry Creek. You've really made it a first class area of the shop.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to also thank you. This may seem like a simple piece of art, but it isn't. It takes a lot of craft and a lot of skill to do something like this. To work with glass is a very, very it's a technique that requires a lot of skill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I know this because when we had our in our schools a long time ago, you worked one of the things that we you were able to do and is is work with Glass. And one of the places that we went to to take a look at it was what you did to kind of expiries expire inspire us'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Well, there certainly is. So I have to say, as I was making my comments, if they seemed impersonal, where I sit, I can barely see you. The television to the computer monitor at the podium blocks you. But Sandy, I would love to have you come up and say a few words about your career and Denver, whatever's on'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It gave us recognition that we hadn't had, even though we had been representing him. A lot of people didn't know what glass art was. So we're very appreciative of what the gardens did and what the city did. So thank you.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Basically, there will be about 53 or so households that will be displaced as a result of this, the I-70 realignment. And so this project is intended to replace that housing. It's also intended to serve as an economic development opportunity to create jobs.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. And actually, I would ask my coworker, Tony Pickett, who's our vice president of master site development, to join me because I'm on the acquisition side and do the negotiations with the seller. And then Tony gets to play with all of the designs.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Okay, great. So I want to give just a little credit right now, because Councilwoman Monteiro is being shy over here. But she, the Urban Land Conservancy and OED worked really hard to make sure that we had affordable housing where a ton of public and private investment is going.'",

Tuesday was passed a resolution feeling that they should not RTD should not front any money to municipalities for work they are doing for the municipalities, and that the money should be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'sent to them upfront for the work that they would then perform, which is obviously very different than what we've been doing for ever, because this is a time sensitive project in terms of moving it forward with the federal grant money we have or that RTD has received.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We negotiated with RTD staff, and this is a 15 day turnaround payment. They will supply us invoices and within 15 days we will have a concurrent review of those invoices with RTD staff and pay RTD the funds based on those undisputed invoices.'",

This is actually downtown funds. So again, it's a reimbursement. So this proposal for these intersections has been approved through the borough board.'",

If this is approved second reading next week, RTD staff will take this out, said for bids on the street and hopefully we can get this project started prior to the November date when'",

We've received no substantial comments from any of our review agencies and our survey for the site has been approved. Notice in public review it has been sent out from informational notice sent on October 24th, Planning Board recommended approval by a vote of 8'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The Register neighborhood organizations included here included greater Greater Park Hill Community and Stapleton United Neighbors. We haven't received an official response from these Arnaud's. The review criteria for rezoning include consistency with adopted plans, the uniformity of district regulations, furthering the public health, safety and welfare.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also look at justifying circumstances for the rezoning and then consistency with the neighborhood context, the zone district purpose and the intent. So within our adopted plans, we have comprehensive plan 2000. We have Blueprint Denver, our land use and transportation plan, and then a fairly older plan of Park Hill neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll go over a brief highlights. These are also in your staff report in greater detail within comprehensive plan. 2000 highlighted our policies regarding legacies and land use to encourage quality infill development, encouraging redevelopment of vacant and underutilized land, identifying areas in which increased density and new uses are desirable and can be accommodated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Certainly vacant parcels along corridors that are redeveloping to fit that description and conserving land throughout the city by promoting infill where services and infrastructure are already in place. And in this case, by virtue of the fact that it is adjacent to Quebec and to 36th, an existing infrastructure, that that situation does exist within Blueprint Denver, the site'",
        "'speaker_7': 'is actually identified as single family residential. This is one of those sites within the city that taken out a 30,000 foot view blueprint. Denver didn't look at every parcel in great detail and certainly parcels along the Quebec corridor, which has historically been commercial, would be fit into one of those parcels that deserve further analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Within Blueprint Denver, there is a concept called Reinvestment Area, and even in an area of stability, you do have areas that would benefit from reinvestment through modest infill or redevelopment or major projects in a smaller area. In this particular vacant site that is to the east of a stable residential neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Fitz fits that description. Staff believes, and it is a reinvestment area for targeted growth. Quebec is identified as a commercial arterial, which is one of the very most widespread commercial street types. It's historically auto oriented. Over time, we have seen, especially with our mixed use districts in the new code street and sidewalk improvements with new development that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'provide a better pedestrian friendly access to these sites. Because Stapleton's to the east and Stapleton has been an area of change and has generated a lot of commercial activity. There is actually quite a bit of pedestrian activity that comes from the west across Quebec.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the connection to the area of change generating a lot of the improvements is important in this case and the site is pivotal to that. The Park Hill Neighborhood Plan identifies that there's a need to develop vacant land with compatible context sensitive uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Quebec is designated in that plan as a Quebec street corridor, where it's encouraged to maintain the viability of the corridor. And that also means looking at transitions in land use over time. Certainly when the hotels in Stapleton left, there were definitely opportunities for that transition to occur.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Also to create sensitive transitions between commercial industrial uses and residential areas, improving corridors and other shopping nodes for residents in adjacent neighborhoods, and then voluntary urban design guidelines were sort of established in that plan to encourage pedestrian oriented ground floor redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So some of the tenants in the plan would a would exist at least as plan guidance upon redevelopment of the site. The MAP Amendment does result in regulations that are uniform across the district. This means that the Smc's five or propose zone district for mixed use is already a mixed use district or simply asking for an increase'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The proposal furthers the public health, safety and welfare, provides for a modest reinvestment of major projects in a small area along the evolving Quebec corridor and development of vacant underutilized land promotes eyes in the street and improves the neighborhood edge.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Within justifying circumstances pursuant to Arizona Code Section 1214 eight, the land or its surrounding environment has changed or is changing to such a degree that it is in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the changed character of the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, it's west of Stapleton, along a commercial arterial that has historically been developed as a nonresidential land use. Now this is continuing to evolve it so that there is even a better transition to the residential to the West.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The same X5 district suburban context which is characterized by multiple uses, typically less vertical and mixed use that can be vertical mixed use. You do see some commercial strips in office parks. Reinvestment would allow for a variety of building forms to occur here for a modest increase in height at this location, sensitive transitions to the residential block'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Some X three and some x five. So the district that it currently is zoned as some x three has a current height limitation of 45 feet. The request essentially asks for a height increase of 1515 feet to 70 feet, sorry, 25 feet and then storeys.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are three stories allowed. You would allow five storeys, so five storeys and 70 feet. The location for an some x three typically is on a slightly less busy streets, a local or collector streets. Here the S-Max five is appropriate for collectors or arterials.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Upper story setbacks are also important at this location because it is to the west is the residential neighborhood in the SM x three where a building goes up to 27 feet high. There would be a 15 foot setback in into the site to provide for a height transition adjacent to residential in the SM x five.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's an additional 15 foot setback when you get the building at 51 feet. So there's a total of 35 feet setback if you have a building that's taller than 51 feet and that's not set back from the ground.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's an upper story setback, essentially. So with that and that comparison, CPD recommends approval of this zone district finding that all criteria have been met. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. Ross. We have one speaker this evening and Mr. Jeff Crosby.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Mr. President. And City Council. My name is Jeff Grassi. I live in Denver at 463 Locust Street. I'm here to answer any questions that city council may have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Grandy. That concludes our speakers. Now, moving to questions, are there any questions of members of council? Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. Garza, can you just give us some idea of what you plan to put there?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At this point, we would love to see something like a retirement home retirement center with retail space on the ground floor. Beauty shop, convenience store, that type of thing. We don't have any plans on the drawing boards. We're in the process of negotiating with another with a developer, actually, who's worked on some other projects with us and'",
        "'speaker_8': 'see what we can do with it. But as far as anything concrete, no, there's nothing really on the drawing board at this point.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Any other questions on accountability in 96? All right. Seen none. The public hearing on 1096 is closed on and we'll move to comments. And as this is in Council District 11, I will speak I something I drive by nearly every day an opportunity for something better than just this empty lot I am certainly'",
        "'speaker_3': 'excited about, and I certainly hope my colleagues will support this. I just do find it interesting that just east of the site is one of our infamous red light cameras at 36 in Quebec. So just thought I'd just throw that out just for a good laugh.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'All right. Any other comments from members of the Council on 1096? Scene and we are ready for roll call. Secretary Roll Call.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'BROOKS Hi. Brown Hi, Fats.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can eat Lemon Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I. Monteiro. Nevitt. Ortega. Hi, Rob Shepherd. Sussman Hi, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting, announce the results. 3939 Council Bill 1096 has passed. See no other business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.'"
