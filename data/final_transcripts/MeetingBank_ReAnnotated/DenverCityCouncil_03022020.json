    "Proclamation for Judge Brian Thomas Campbell.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, moving on. There are no presentations and there are no communications this evening, but we do have one proclamation being read aloud. Councilmember Ortega, will you please read Proclamation 215?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would be happy to. Thank you, Mr. President. Proclamation number 202 15 Recognizing the service of Judge Bryant Thomas Campbell to the city of Denver. Whereas Brian Thomas Campbell was appointed by Mayor William H. McNichols, Jr. To Denver County Court and sworn in on March ten, 1980.'",

Whereas, during his term as presiding Judge, Campbell oversaw the move of the Civil Division from the basement of the city and county building to the Radisson Office Complex, and proposed, with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'help of the Denver Bar Association president Joe Dish Singer the creation of a warm welcome child care center. Most importantly, in 1992, he established one of the first full time restraining order courts in the nation. And. Whereas, in 1985, Judge Campbell was assigned the task of implementing the first Denver County Environmental Court.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 1989, Judge Campbell was the first Denver County Court judge to utilize the alternative jail sentences such as in-home detention. Finally, in 2011, Judge Campbell was selected as the first judge to establish and preside over the first. Denver County Court.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver County Sobriety. Court. Whereas during his career, Judge Campbell received numerous awards recognizing his work, including the Denver Bar Association's Judicial Excellence Award in 1990.

Section one that the Council of the City and County Denver recognizes Judge Brian Thomas Campbell invaluable service to the city of Denver throughout his career and the positive impact his leadership has had on our community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'His career represents a true commitment to uphold the values of justice in public service. Section two that the Clerk of the city and county of Denver shall affix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to Judge Campbell and his family.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Your motion to adopt.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I move for the adoption of proclamation number two.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think I have just one year on Judge Campbell in working with the city of Denver or coming to work for the city of Denver. But over the years have had much opportunities to interface with Judge Campbell in his various capacities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And one of the things the proclamation doesn't mention is the annual reception that is held with all of the judges in city council, where we have an opportunity to at least know who are county court judges are and have a chance to just interface with them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I don't remember if that was started by you, Judge Campbell, but I think being able to have that interface is really important. It's not that very often that we actually work with our judges to shape some of the policies.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know from time to time, a number of our judges have sat on various committees. And Judge Campbell has, in fact, been one of those who has helped from from the bench side shape a lot of the policy decisions that really kind of address how people are handled when they come to courts in a different way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just want to say thank you, Judge Campbell, to you, to your family for for letting you spend so much of your time here working with the people of Denver, but really appreciate your many, many years of service to the city of Denver and just want to encourage all of my colleagues to support this proclamation tonight'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. And unfortunately, Councilwoman Black couldn't be here tonight but wanted me to read her. Congratulations. Like Council and Black. Judge Campbell is a near lifelong resident of Southeast Denver. And her constituent, in fact, he grew up with Councilwoman Black's older sister when they were kids.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'South Colorado Boulevard was a two lane dirt road. Back then, Denver was having a housing crisis due to the postwar population boom. Houses were hastily constructed in the under undeveloped part of Denver so that families had a place to live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But the building of schools was behind schedule as the first high school in far southeast Denver and Denver's fifth high school, Thomas Jefferson High School, opened in 1960 with grades six through 12. Judge Campbell and Councilwoman Black Sister started as seventh graders and graduated together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is what put southeast Denver on the map. A real high school. Since then, Judge Campbell has had an incredible career as a judge and a positive impact on people who live in Denver. He cares deeply about his native city and every single person who lives here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'He's helped many in need and leaves a positive legacy. From Kendra Valley's black and Debra Valleys, your southeast Denver friends, congratulations and thank you for a life well lived, a great career, and for your incredible service to our beloved city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Madam Secretary, roll call on our proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Ortega.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Torres, i. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Almost everybody up there on the screen. Anybody? Mr. Madam Secretary, please go to the voting. Announce the result.'",
        "'speaker_3': '11 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 Eyes. Proclamation 215 has been adopted. We do have 5 minutes set aside for proclamation acceptance. Is there someone you'd like to call up Councilmember?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, there is. I would like to ask Judge Bryant Thomas Campbell, if you would please join us at the podium.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, counsel. Well, one or two and I can actually forfeit two or 3 minutes because she did such a wonderful job of pointing so many things out. The fact that we've been together for so long, knowing each other, running into each other in the halls.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'More importantly, her comments about the judges functions that we have periodically. I think we're probably going to have one here in the very near future because we've got some new council people and it's a good way to get to know the judges and the judges to get to know better.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The council members, even the mayor comes. So it's it's a good reception that we have. And I think it speaks to what one of the things that makes Denver so unique, and that is we're all pulling together on all these things.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilwoman Ortega, my ears perked up when you were talking about having the function that you're having and that you're going to focus in on evictions and rental assistance and everything like that. The Denver County Court is 100% behind that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We're pushing the envelope as far as we can. We're catching some flak from it. But it's it's important to you. It's important to county court. It's important to all of us. So there's a lot of things that we can foster if we just work together and we're more than happy to work together on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I do want to introduce my family to the far right there is my brother in law, John Rose. He's a cardiologist out at I.C.U. East Carolina University, Denver native, too. As was mentioned earlier, his wife, Jane Rose.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My wife, Cheryl Rose. And it's kind of interesting because Cheryl went to North High School. And as we mentioned, I went to T.J. so she was on the northwest corner and I was on the south east corner. And yet really, we were high school sweethearts, but we didn't meet till we were 49 and 50.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That explains why I didn't they too much in high school and everything like that. So thank you for the honor. Councilwoman Ortega. And thank you all for voting for it. I think it's the only time in my life where everybody everybody's voted for me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And thank you so much for your service to our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you for bringing that forward, Councilmember Ortega. That brings us to our bills for introduction. Madam Secretary, will you please read the bills for Introduction.'"

    "Approval of DOTI 2020 Annual Programs and Waiver of Contract Review.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? It doesn't look like it. All right, Madam Secretary, if you please put the first item on our screens. And Councilmember Herndon, please put Council Bill 59 on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Mr. President. Move the council bill 2000 0059 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It has been moved and seconded questions by members of Council Council Member State Abarca.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I called this bill out specifically to go on record as voting no for this and just for the public who are who's viewing this. This is an ordinance that would be a blanket authorization of our annual work program, and that includes street paving, concrete traffic signals, pavement markings all within this work program and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'totals to probably over 25 million. Last year it was about 12 contracts. And for the same reasons that we are being asked to approve this, I will be a no. I don't believe that with contracts that are an annual expectation that there should be this need to expedite and have this blanket approval.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that we have checks and balances of separate branches of government in place for a reason. And so to allow these 12 contracts and this $25 million to be spent without coming directly to council for each individual contract, I think is problematic.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And just to remind people, this is not a practice that we've always had. It's only been a practice since 2011. And so I will be a no tonight and I hope my colleagues will join me. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with Councilwoman CdeBaca. I have a lot of concerns about transparency and accountability. And I think that there you know, this is this last year was only regarding 12 contracts. I think that that's not too much to ask, that these 12 contracts come through one at a time to be approved by council'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And so I will also be a know tonight. I think that, you know, these can come through just like all the other contracts that come through and are approved by council. So I will also be a no tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But thank you, Mr. President. Is there someone here from Dottie who could answer questions? Oh, there is. Good evening. Council members Jason Gallardo with the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure. Mr. Gallardo, thank you for for coming tonight. We've heard from a few of our constituents that, frankly, that I should vote against this because we shouldn't give daddy'",
        "'speaker_1': 'a blank check. These are their words. Is this a blank check for Daddy? No. Councilman. Member. It's not. What we do here is this is for maintenance only. So, for example, if we are doing our paving program, our annual paving program, which I sent out to everybody that is a 2020 annual paving program, shows what we're going'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to be paying for this year, which is an estimated around 570 mile go. What this does is it puts funding towards that early. We're able to get into contract with these contractors early on in order to be able to hold these contractors, to be able to do the work throughout the season.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're capable of doing it. So this money is spent towards maintenance only. It's not going to be new projects. We can't wait in roads with it. We can't. All those type of contracts will have to come through council like normal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is only for maintenance, for assets we already own. When somebody says they have issues on the roads because it's getting, you know, really beaten up and we go over there and pave it. That's where this fund comes from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it's there is a reason why we couldn't vote on these. I guess last year there were 12 contracts that came before us. I mean, what's the advantage of this mechanism? Because, I mean, we have what are the what are the contracts called?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Where we have you know, I think you we already have on call contracts. So why why couldn't we just approve on call contracts? The reason we did this way in 2011, there was an agreement made that we would bring all these contracts in together as wants to get these contractors under contract early on.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What we found is as we're doing work and we're putting contracts out, we end up towards the end of the season losing contractors because they're full with other work. This allows us to keep our program in and actually map out the entire city of projects that we want to get done for the entire season and to move'",
        "'speaker_1': 'smoothly and keep it going. This is why we were able to hit our goal 500 and I think it was 20 miles of of paved roads last year, which is the most that public works has ever done, is because we were able to get these people under contract early on, these contractors, and make it where we are'",
        "'speaker_1': 'able to do this work throughout the city without stopping and going through the process, which takes, you know, months at a time. Well, I think I've been on record of not being a super fan of of lane miles of roads, but I don't think that's what's in conversation right tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The but we couldn't we approved 12 on or you know however many vendors 12 on call contracts for the total budget amount and then if that comes in under, then we'd be fine. I guess I'm still struggling with why is this?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know what, what do we need to do this now as opposed to approving 12 on call contracts for the full budget amount or whatever, whatever the answer is to make sure I get you the correct answer, I'm actually on call.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A colleague of mine up here, Beth Zullo, who knows a little bit more about the process and has done it for this entire time. And maybe she can help answer some more questions to. And also we have a Pat Kennedy here that has designed paving and those type of things, if you have any questions on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening. So the reason we do this is to, as Jason said, get people under contract earlier. It saves somewhere around 40 or 50 days per contract to take through the budget amounts that were approved for these contracts in mass in this ordinance tonight and then not take them through one at a time through the council process'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that can add anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks to our process typically. And this allows us to bypass that and go right to the contract. So it would advance in the contracting workflow and go to the city attorney and be fully executed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And will you mention your name for the record and for the William? Thank you. And I guess I'm going to go back to the blank check question that I asked Mr. Gallardo. Really, this this isn't a blank check.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is just the amount budgeted. Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's re approving the amount that was appropriated through the annual budget process. And we attach that to these contracts. So if they if they were to come in above that budget, they would have to come through council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. No exception to that. It's just re approving the appropriated amounts.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I would also say that I'm not a super fan of the budget either, but I was sworn in as it was already most of the way underway. So thank you for your questions. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thank you. Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Your answers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council members and all.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. Hey, can I have Jason come back up? I have a quick question. I didn't see.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for your email. I saw that you emailed us the list of from 2019. Yes. What can you do you. When can we expect a list for the 2020 work? So we're approving. I am going over some of the documents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So specifically I see light infrastructure. So likes like traffic lights. Does that include work that would put left turn arrows or right turn arrows on that? Or is that new new infrastructure like completely new replacing them?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, this is to maintain what we already have to make sure that it's operating properly and everything else is not to put in anything new. This is in the any new construction that we do that reaches over the 500,000 mark will come through city council as normal.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So adding a left turn arrow, let's say you're going southbound on federal and you want to do turn a left turn arrow so you could head eastbound on 32nd Avenue that would initiate a 500,000. Right. So is some of that money for smaller improvements like that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because I would think that would be an improvement to our infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'd have to know what budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It comes out. Yeah, it would depend because, you know, unfortunately, we have a lot of money coming from different places, from different budgets. So it depend on where it's at and what what the actual ask is to know exactly where it's coming from.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For example, if we were putting a left hand turn next to a school because there is a reason for safety issues, it can come out of this safe for us to school budget or something like that, depending on where it is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, it gets more complicated when we talk about a specific area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So back to my first question for this whole total amount for the annual programs, the improvement programs and the capital maintenance, the facilities waste money. When will we get a line item budget like what you sent us today for 2019?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When can we expect that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Quarterly. So we send it out quarterly to everyone and we will be sending it out in three months and give you the entire every quarter letting you know where we're at, who's under contract and what what work has been done so far.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we have.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not always.'",
        "'speaker_4': '2000 yet. Year 2000. Right. Because it's the it's the we're proving it for 2012, 2020.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we haven't gotten the 2021 yet.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. This is what you're proving. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sorry. If you're going to if you're going to answer a question, you have to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Have the microphone for everybody who's watching on TV get that report.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's the in the first quarter.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right, the end of first quarter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It January, February, March. So in March.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Into March.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll get that time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Frame. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll get it quarterly.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. I'm going to ask Mr. Kennedy, if you wouldn't mind coming up to the podium.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Ted Kennedy with over here, Dottie, Office of Asset Management.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Can you tell us how the annual work schedule plays into this? I know we got the map showing us where some of those areas are that are outlined for 2020.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So our construction season for both in-house and contracted work starts in April and precedes until weather shuts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Us down.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In the end of the year. So that part of that's the criticality of the days that Nizzolo talked about for helping us get started helps us get these these programs going. So we have a full construction season order to complete our work.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But the info that was sent over to us is part of what guides the projects that are part of these contracts, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank Councilmember Councilmember Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pat or Jason and maybe Jason actually for the reporting that we'll see. You know, one of one of the things that I'm interested in is not just efficiencies of this, but how the decisions are being made.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it's just a chronological response to when streets need to be repaved, or if you're referring back to department goals around neighborhood equity, program equity, things like that, and if, if or how, that would be included in your quarterly report.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that going forward, we definitely like we talked earlier today that the equity part is playing a much bigger role in our decision making going forward. And I and I think, you know, first applaud council for bringing that to the forefront of every conversation we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And in this aspect, we plan on putting that, implementing it going forward in more equity to be able to show you where we're doing and how we're laying out the process when it comes. To actual paving. They have a great plan.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that is is that goes based off of how old and how long the roads have been there and what was the last thing we laid down. So how long it lasts and we try to try to keep up with that program based off the road's ability just to last.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But everything else that you're talking about. Yes. I mean, I think everything needs to be under the equity lens.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think for for me, given this is my first time being involved in approving this process, I'd like to see that play out before seeing if this needs to be refined or done differently. Just being on the city side, I do recognize how long it takes for contracts to be developed and delivered, especially for something that I'",
        "'speaker_3': 'know my residents rely on, which is the regular paving of their streets. But that piece is going to be a big one for me, so I'm definitely going to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Be looking at where we're happy to work with you on that, and we are going to do individual council member briefings on your paving that's going on in your districts. We're getting those scheduled now. You absolutely.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank. Councilmember Councilmember Flint.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Can I ask the city attorney to just shed a little light on this process, Kiersten or Jonathan, I'm sorry you weren't doing a crossword over there or anything. I hope this ability for the department to ask for this waiver was embedded in the charter about 15 or 16 years ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And could you describe what that did? Because we applied to Cynthia at DIA also.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's right. Here's one covered legislative council. And after I give you the short answer, I'm happy to look up the time period because I can check that in the charter. But 3.2.6 of the charter does give council the option to waive approvals of certain contracts.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we do have a code provision in Chapter 13. I think it's 1311 where we have where council has explicitly waived authority for certain airport contracts. For example, construction contracts that exceed 5 million or under 5 million do not require council approval is not uncommon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Rather than 500,000.'",
        "'speaker_3': '500,000 is the threshold for professional services, but 5 million is the threshold for approval of construction contracts at the airport.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. And Jason or. Well, Jason, the the process, as I recall it, is that within the annual appropriation for this work, we authorize we with this ordinance, we would authorize the department to go out, seek bids. And what you do describe that process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'My understanding is that you do a competitive bid for each piece of the work and you go with the lowest responsive bidder, including all of our social ordinances, ah and BWB requirements, etc. and then report to us who those folks who were, what companies were selected on a quarterly basis.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's not how basically it works.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's that's exactly how it works, Councilman. And I really don't even have anything to add to that. That's exactly the process. And the lowest bidder does win. And we will report out who wins and the maybe we be contracts that we add to it and you'll know all the information as we as those contracts are made.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the reason that you ask this is because of the paving season and the asphalt the season and the fact that a lot of these contractors need to develop their summer work plans. And so if we can lock them up now, we can guarantee that this program will be completed this year.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct. That's correct, Councilman. And this is how we're able to be efficient and get as much done as possible. We set up goals and timing is everything for the paving season. It's weather. It's it's all these aspects to that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And that's why we try to do it, this process to get it done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank Councilmember a councilmember say to back you. Back up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President. A couple more questions for you, Jason, and just also a clarification for my colleagues. We approve a budget and then the rest of our entire job every Monday night is approving the transactions that fall within that budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so to color this as something that's unique and needs special consideration, I think is problematic. But I do have a question about the contracts that get expedited. So we've had things that the administration needed to see done faster, come through direct file.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so why would this not be a tool that we use for this type of contract, considering there would likely be less cost? Privacy on something that is part of this annual work program.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think because of the transparency in the ability to watch contracts being made, which is a little bit different because we're actually going in contract with a vendor and doing direct file from the mayor's office could make it more political than anything else.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To have the transparency to go through is proper process is what makes it this way a little bit better.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we're asking to basically skip over the proper process and instead blanket authorize multiple contracts to be executed outside of the public side.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think that that that our goal here and I and I don't want to talk on behalf of the administration or anybody else why they would do it one way or another. I just think our goal here is to be able to get the money to fund that season, to get as much work done as possible as'",
        "'speaker_1': 'the paving program is related to this and any kind of maintenance we have outside of that to to get into a different process outside of this would be a conversation that I think that we're more than willing to have about that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's just this is the process that we're moving forward with is an annual ordinance that we've been doing since 2011.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so can you explain why for an annual program of work like this, we're not a new organization. We're a city that contracts with people all of the time, people who are under the expectation that they'll have to go through these processes annually.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you tell me why? For our annual work program, we wouldn't have contractors on deck so that by the time we're here in February, instead of approving this blanket authorization, we're actually approving all 12 contracts because.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because the funds don't become available until January. So that's when the work can be left.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's March.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So what I'm saying is, why wouldn't we have those 12 contracts on deck right now to be voting on those 12 contracts rather than the blanket authorization?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't have an answer.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So. So just so you can clarify, you're asking us to where we under contract before the money is allocated.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the money was allocated way before. Now it's March. And realistically, I would expect that we would have 12 companies that we're talking to to implement this work. And so and so, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The way it works is we, we get the money that is allocated to us. Then we go through this process and then we put out RFP for them to apply to this process. But without the money actually being through there and actually going through this process, we can't have an RFP.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We can't have the companies ready until we have an actual RFP that goes out there and allows people to apply for it. And we get the lowest bid and go through that process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then got that because we're skipping that. But real quick, can you explain to me the difference between what we've listed as going with the lowest bidder versus best value contracting? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The lowest bidder versus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'These are awarded through hard bid, which is lowest responsive, responsible bidder. So it's just a different method of contracting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And what is the difference?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Best value can look at other things like schedule or duration types of work. We don't typically see that in this kind of flat work construction. That would be something like the Convention Center or the Great Hall at DEN are usually done through value.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So does best value take into consideration a company's safety and health performance record on past qualification does. And so we're when we go with the lowest bidder, we're not taking any of that into consideration.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, anything over $1,000,000 is subject to the city's pre-qualification rule.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So how do we know which one of these contracts is being held to that rule if they're not coming before us individually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Pre-Qualification is a condition to be able to bid the projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So do we have breakdowns for 2020 of how much each contract is going to be? And do we know if they all fit within that million dollar pre-qualification rule?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't have an answer to that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'For the contracts that go up, we have engineers estimates. There's always a couple of the concrete contracts that fall in the 500000 to $750000 range that are designated for small business enterprises. But all of the other bigger contracts are well over a million, and those are all subject to pre-qualification by the contractors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. But we're not using best value contracting with them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, these are hard bid contracts. Subject that the vendor, the successful contractor meets the prequel requirements and meets any SBC or BMB guidelines that are put in those contracts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Gallardo, if we vote this down tonight, does that significantly improve or impact our paving work? I mean, significant, I guess. Would you have to define what was significant to you and to me? But yes, it does delay our process.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. What would if we were to vote this down tonight? Let me try to rephrase the question. We voted down tonight. Then you would have you was in the administration or Dottie would then have to put forward 12.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Proposals, 12 different contracts in 12 different RFP, the project contracts, and goes through the process, which could be anywhere between 60 and 90 days. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank Councilmember Councilmember Torres.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just clarification, Councilman CdeBaca asked a question about best value that I had asked over email, but I'd gotten a slightly different response. Mine had to do my response that I had had more to do with the language in the charter.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can can you guys clarify if.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead and ask to go with clarify on why I'm sorry, which.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Why we base on lowest bid versus best value.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Um, do you have a in search of why we're.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Based on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know what is defined as best value.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Um, I. I'm sorry. I don't think I have an answer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I guess the best I could say on that one is, is, as Beth had mentioned, best value contracts are generally those large scale contracts like the Convention Center or the Great Hall, where these are limited in scope. They're repairing curbing gutters or performing a specific treatment on pavements.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They're installing pedestrian curb ramps at intersections, so they're more of a limited scope. So the best value is obtained by the lowest responsible bid on those unit prices.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm. Okay. I have to go back to the emails that I got. There was something different around the language that we're required as a city to comply with that was in charter around accepting lowest bids. And that that's that's the clarification that I'm asking someone to make.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I can definitely get you that clarification and make sure that you have the proper answer to that. I'll look. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just a real quick follow up on Councilman Hines question about what happens if we're too delayed tonight. We approve several contracts all of the time for on call services, for street paving, for concrete, for curbs and sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we have multiple people right now on call in the city with encumbered funds for their contracts. I'm wondering why they wouldn't in the interim be deployed to provide some of these resources or accomplish some of these goals in our work program?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think a lot of those are the scale that they're on. On call now is nowhere near the scale that the full paving plan is. We're talking about a more larger citywide paving plan versus taking care of little minor things here and there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is a much bigger contract in that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Will any of the contracts. Based on your past experience with these work plans? Will any of the upcoming contractors be those that we already have on call?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They might be. This is an RFP process that hasn't happened yet, so I can't answer that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Got it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going to call up real quick, guys. Stewart it from the mayor's office to get a clarification on the question that was asked by Councilmember Torres about the response that you got.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi. Skye Stewart Mares Officer, historian, up the stairs to answer things. Councilman Torres, when we had that conversation, we were talking about Section 2.3.3 of the charter, which talks about construction, reconstruction, remodeling of general public improvement projects, and that they need to be awarded to the lowest responsive, qualified bidder through a hard bid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that applies to this particular body of work. It does. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Sorry that I'm still up here. Just one more question. What did we do before 2011? Because I think this this took effect 2011, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct, Councilman. What it does and so, as Beth said, it helps us accelerate the process by, you know, 3 to 6 weeks when you're dealing with a finite construction season, maybe only six months long, you could lose 20% of your construction season.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And in the past, yes, we had those issues where we had noticed a proceeds that couldn't be released until May or June, and we were losing a substantial portion of our construction season. And then if you get hit with an early snow like we had last October, it can seriously impact your ability to keep, you know, your'",
        "'speaker_9': 'annual work programs completed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm not excited about the budget. I'm not excited about some of the questions that have asked. But I am concerned that I don't want to mess up our schedule by shooting this down tonight, so I will vote for it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I wanted to I want to revisit this before this time next year so that we can we can get this sorted out and we don't run into this same kind of thing for the for the next year's budget.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember. All right, so no other questions or comments, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'CdeBaca No.'",

    "2020 Salary and Fringe Benefits for Denver Sheriff's Department Command Staff.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Two nays nine. His counterpart, 59, has been ordered published. Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens and Councilmember Herndon, will you please put Councilman 148 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, Mr. President. I move the Council Bill series to the 20 0148.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. It has been moved and seconded questions or comments by members of Council Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Is Laura Wachter or somebody who can speak on her behalf here?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. Members of Council Rob Asper with the Denver City Attorney's Office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. I have some questions related to the changed contract, so or the changed ordinance. I'm not on the safety committee and so I go when I can, but when I can't go, I pull off the documents that are posted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I pulled off the draft bill last week. And then on over the weekend there was a new bill posted. And so there's some discrepancies or changes that I was not privy to. And so I wanted to get some more information about that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if you could start by walking me through the CPA process and how we got to this 3.5 increase.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This increase for our command staff mirrors the salary increase that was negotiated by the rank and file within the Denver Sheriff's Department. So that would be deputies who hold the rank of deputy, deputy sheriff, sergeant and deputy sheriff, captain.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They all received a 3.5% increase for the calendar year 2020. This ordinance would reflect the same level of increase 3.5% for those members of the department in the command staff that's comprised of deputy sheriff majors, deputy sheriff, division chief's and the sheriff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Were employees or deputies involved in any of these negotiations who negotiates on their behalf.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For the bargaining unit? They are represented by the Fraternal Order of Police. They have a an attorney who comes up from Kansas City every time there is a negotiation and they negotiate their salary and benefits on behalf of the rank and file.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They do not bargain for the command staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so and this is an increase for the command staff. So nobody was negotiating on their behalf for this ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, they are not a member. They are not members of the bargaining unit. Their salaries are established by ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And so I became more interested in this issue of pay parity in this department across other departments in the in public safety. After a presentation we got from deputies about a week ago, they were sharing with us their challenges related to recruitment and retention.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I got really concerned. And so this initial bill was a red flag to me because although it's been changed, there was a section in there that called out to separate pay increases for the same exact position with only one month hiring difference, and the disparity was over $20,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I'm wondering if you can explain to me why these this exact same position was divided into two call outs to separate salaries and what happened between last Friday and now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, understood. There was a point in time where we had division chiefs who had attained that rank by virtue of a promotion through the career service promotional process back, I believe it was. And in late 15 or 20 and early 2016, the position of Division Chief became an appointed rank, which means that individuals didn't have to compete'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for that position and go through the promotional process that was required beforehand. So we we found ourselves in a position where we had a couple of division chiefs who were appointed to that position, who were overseeing the work of division chiefs, who attained their rank through the promotional process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So to make up the difference, because you had division chiefs who were supervising other division chiefs, you paid the same amount. The decision was made to give those appointed division chiefs the extra compensation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so in this original document, when I started digging around, what I found was that the lower paid division chief happens to be black and the higher paid division chief happens to be white. And so can you explain to me what your efforts have been around equity in the department?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't I can't speak to the efforts in that regard. But what I can tell you is that in the bill, that was the final bill that was filed for consideration tonight, there no longer is that difference between division chiefs who are appointed and division chiefs who were who attained that rank by the promotional process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's only one rate for a division chief, regardless of whether that person has been appointed to that position or promoted into that rank.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, have you ever heard of a pay structure within the department that was set up under Sheriff Furman that was referred to as Big Chief. Little chief?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have not. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And can you explain to me if there have been any efforts to ensure parity across departments? What we heard a lot about in our meeting with the sheriffs in committee the other day was that there are some very drastic pay disparities for the same or equivalent positions in DPD.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we've matched up those positions. And so majors are the equivalent of commanders, captains, equivalent of lieutenants, sergeants, sergeants, field training and corporal. And so I'm wondering, because when I dug up those salaries, there are still very significant pay disparities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is the sheriff's department conscious of that and working toward eliminating those pay gaps?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's my understanding that that the goal of the Safety Department is to ensure that all of its command staff is fairly compensated, regardless of whether they work for the Denver Sheriff's Department, the Denver Police Department or the fire department.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The problem we have with comparing these various command staff positions across the various departments is we are comparing apples to oranges. There is the command staff is not as deep within the sheriff's department. There aren't as many layers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what we try to do is to ensure that for the sheriff command staff that there is sufficient differential between the highest negotiated rate for captains, looking at the majors, looking at division chiefs, looking at the sheriffs. So we don't have salary compression issues within this command staff.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I get the compression issues, but across departments, we have major inequities and it doesn't look good when you're most diverse. Department is the sheriff's department where you have a much wider DPD and fire. And so my concern is about pay equity across the departments.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I did have another question about the defining equity and defining parity. When you mentioned that there were no deputies or no members of the command staff advocating for themselves in these negotiations, how do you guys ensure there represent represented in these conversations?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't speak to that because I'm not involved with those negotiations or conversations between current command staff members and and the administration of the Safety Department.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Who are the parties involved?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I believe Laura Wachter was one of the individuals who was involved, and I can see that she reaches out to you if you have further questions.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would deeply appreciate that and hopefully next time before the changes. So thank you.'",
