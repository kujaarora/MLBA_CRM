        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that's right. And as you stand there looking right into the big blue bears, but you will smile and you will realize that that small moment of joy could be the most important lesson we could ever teach our kids.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For me, this love was started when I was in the streets walking through the west side of Denver. I saw some of the most powerful paintings written on the walls. The graffiti is vibrant colors reflected how most of us felt inside.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Something about seeing names on the wall gave us the feeling of ownership we never obtained through mortgage contracts. Many of my friends would stay up all night searching for the perfect spot a wall that was worthy of their masterpiece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They felt like little kids aligning alphabetical magnets onto the city's fridge. They wrote short poems on bricks because their schools failed to provide them paper. Their artwork never lasted very long before that short time. They turned our alleys into art galleries and trash cans into anthologies.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They are the seeds that birthed the roses that now grow in the Santa Fe art district. Yet they were never cited in the government documents. I have witnessed art nourish a community in ways that politicians could never imagine.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Like the time that mural was spray painted across the street from the middle school. The mural was a desperate cry. Cease fire. I watched members of opposing gangs come together using the colors of the rags to spray paint the words barrio unity, a treaty attempting to end gay brown on brown violence.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there hasn't been a drive by on that corner since I have listened to spoken word artists and hip hop artists communicate and mobilize the people in the language that academia has deemed worthless. The same words that donors used to describe our services, like helping a kid get through a rough day isn't worth the investment because happiness'",
        "'speaker_0': 'isn't an accurate measurement of success. But you tell that to the little girl who feels unbreakable when she hip hop on the dance floor. You tell that to the gay boy who just came out to his parents and a poem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You tell that to the musicians who use this to bounce the sounds of the parents arguing off their instruments. Our youth are our future. Let us give them the tools they need to paint themselves a better world. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Second arrow. Thank you for sharing your words with us. They are very empowering and compelling. And thank you again to the Denver Jazz Club. Can you believe the sound that came out of that? That group, they are great and they travel all over the United States to entertain us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So let's give a young another round of applause for all these young performers because they make Denver an artist. And now I would like to invite to the podium our acclaimed Mr. Kent Rice. No, the band was not named after Kent Reiss.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was named in front of him, he told me, though. Welcome, Kent and Ginger White. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you so much for this proclamation. Thank you to our entertainers. That poem was moving. It was amazing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Anyway, we're very grateful to accept this proclamation and a great debt of gratitude to Ginger, why she did so much of the heavy lifting for this great ginger.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did you want to say a few words? Oh, I just wanted to say thank you both. I thank you all so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We had a chance to brief you all individually, and it was a pleasure to walk through the plan with you. We're so proud of it. We're so proud of what we're delivering to the city of Denver on behalf of the city of Denver, because it really was a community wide plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I stand on the shoulder of some great teammates behind me who made this all possible. So thank you all for your for your help and helping us implement it as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The one of the phrases that came up from our 5000 people who provided input and it's the thing on which our clothes was we are Denver Oh, that's great.'"

        "'speaker_2': 'And it was the physics conference, and they were men from across the world. And and it struck me there were a few women. And it's one of those moments where you start to think, perhaps we have not yet totally finished the work that we have to do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so sometimes we get asked the question, why? You know, why focus on this. You have so many women up here on this council. And but but, you know, walking through an experience like that and thinking about the acceptance speech.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'And so I think that really it's a really important thing that the plan that you've put out is very actionable. And I think that's also something that's great about the cultural planning. You know, we talk about what are these things, where are they going to go, are they going to sit on shelves?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But what I think is great about both of them is they have these really concrete suggestions. Right. You know, women need to be able to afford to live in the city and they're struggling with that. Or, you know, artists have a hard time affording to live in the city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's so many interesting things in there that we can address and childcare, access and all of the things you touch on. So so I want to say that I'm very excited that we haven't yet decided that the work is done here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It may look differently than it did for our predecessors and the women whose shoulders that we stand on. But clearly, you know, the torch is being carried forward to continue even in the subtler ways that these challenges occur.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank thank you, Madam President. I want to thank Councilman Brooks for your sponsorship of this proclamation and to the Denver Women's Council. Just a few quick facts. Women comprise 390 591,000, about 49% of the total population or half of Denver residents.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The median age for females in Denver is 33.9. Nearly a third of Denver's female population, 78,819, is under the age of 21. I have a 14 year old daughter. The Denver area neighborhoods with the highest percentage of women all ages living in poverty include Sun Valley, which is 67%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Valverde, which is 49%. Llama Lincoln Park 42%. Westwood 38%. And College View South Platte 37%. So what I want to say is this assessment is long overdue and I want to thank you very much for doing it. The women, the windows in Denver, women and girls.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In order to identify the priority issues and the relevant activities that will generate discussion and action for women.

        "'speaker_6': 'So these findings and future opportunity for Action and Commission work are relevant and timely. The topics of jobs, education, youth safety and the safety net are all critical in bringing our women out of poverty and leveling the playing field for women overall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to thank you very, very much. I sat on the Women's Commission a long time ago, and we were always trying to figure out how do we get our arms around the women that live in the city of Denver?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is a remarkable assessment. And I want to thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Rob. Hi. Sheppard Hi, Adam.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'President Hi, Mr. Secretary. Please close the voting and announce the results. Supervisor In 12 eyes, the proclamation is adopted. Councilman Brooks, is there somebody you would like to call up to the podium to receive the proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There sure is. There's a lot of folks here, but I'm called McKenzie Ruby Squash and she can call up anybody else that she wants to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Brooks. And I would like to ask the commissioners that are present today and Kim Desmond to also join me up here. This certainly was a labor of love and could not have been done without our entire commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So just a small representation here with Jessica Schiavo and Kimberly Desmond. And first, would love to start off by thanking all of you for your support. Councilman Brooks touched on six areas that we have brought forward to the mayor, and I'm sure he'll be leaning on all of you as well to help encourage more women to be'",
        "'speaker_2': 'concessionaires at DIA, to help bring up the number of women who are working in our city government to look at the women we are appointing as judges and many other areas that we can touch on. I had to laugh when we started researching the commission.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The commission and I are actually the exact same age of so 1985 great year and being born to an amazing feminist. I've been very aware of how we have and have not changed in the 29 years that have gone by.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think one of the things that I would really like to recognize today is what a wonderful city Denver is and how far women can come. And what a wonderful picture you all paint of that. This is an incredibly diverse council and I have no doubt that in 1985 it looked very different.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's exciting to be able to lead by example through our council and show what diversity can do to make a world class city. Again, I would like to really mirror the words of Councilman Brooks and invite you all to our party and unveiling tomorrow, 5 to 7 in the rotunda.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the first thing you could do is come and support us there. And then lastly, as has been mentioned by several of you, we have taken our meetings into the community and we started off by going with the different organizations that supported us at the hearing for this assessment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so that's really how we've chosen our initial list. But going forward, we'd like to be very thoughtful and ensure that our 12 meetings of year are held in different districts throughout the city, and we would invite you to come join us for those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would also invite you to bring forward issues that you may be working on that greatly impact the Denver women and girls so that we can help build our agenda around that. And so those are some of the concrete things we would ask for in your support of this assessment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again, thank you all so much. We greatly appreciate it. And of course, a great thanks to our commissioners and to Ken, who have done so much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you very much and congratulations. Two great proclamations. Okay. And moving on. Let's do resolutions. Mr. Secretary, would you please read the resolutions.'"
