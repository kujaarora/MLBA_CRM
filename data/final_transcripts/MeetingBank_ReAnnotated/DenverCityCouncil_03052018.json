        "'speaker_8': 'When the HIV diagnosis among African-American women fell 20%, but it's still at the highest compared to other races and ethnicities. They keep our knowledge and ways away from us, slowly depriving of our self-love and care in order to keep the hierarchy up and keep us down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But as we hold our hands together, bloody and torn, hearing the whispers of our ancestors, we slowly remember. Once we acknowledge these ways, we will use the dirt swept under the table and plant a bright red flower so pure that even we will get the recognition one day.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'But I understand it's it's customary, but I would like somebody from public works to to speak to how this acquisition would be, how this kind of these new this new area, as defined, would be used to sort of assure me and this council that the recommendations of the Illyria neighborhood plan, which asks that the which states in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'their its recommendations that improvements to Brighton Boulevard do not go east beyond what is there today, so that there there is no, you know, destruction of the existing fabric.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Lisa Lemley, Division of Real Estate. So, Councilman, I can address in a general way first, the land acquisition ordinance is what is traditional for us almost 100% of the time. We use the vesting deeds to for each of the properties that we may impact.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The reason for that is we come at a time before the design is 100% completed, but we need to be moving the land acquisition forward or the ordinance forward so that we can meet the timing of the project itself, recognizing that the intent is not to take all of the properties on this particular project.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I can confirm with you, but in general I believe the ratio is ten of them are temporary easements, two are permanent easements and three are partial acquisitions. And the partial acquisitions are where Brighton curves a little bit. And the intent of the project primarily is a little bit of widening and sidewalks where there are no sidewalks right'",
        "'speaker_8': 'now. Now I would need to probably follow up with you on the Illyria plan that you're referencing as it relates to the design in terms of going east. The project is just between 44th and 47th grade.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, yeah. I'm happy it's C 115 or I, I had it printed out but I forgot to bring it. So the, the reason why this is concerning when I saw the legal descriptions is we, we certainly put a exception on the final five feet of the property for the alley right of way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me personally, I would have much rather seen an exception come further closer to the to the front property line where you actually need the right of way. The reason why it's concerning, though, is because we're in the process of acquiring everything west of those properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we can certainly widen and put all the the the right of way improvements on our property that we already own. So I'm just it's important that. Yeah, well the question I should add, I'll ask it this way.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So the intent of the neighborhood plan, which recommends not going east into the existing fabric, would be met by the proposed plan. I mean, the proposed project isn't as envisioned right now, correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'My understanding is yes. And like I said, I'm happy to follow up with you tomorrow then to confirm that. But my understanding is, yes, we are taking just there would be three small parcels and it is just to get around a curve, and that is with land that we do not own as part of the National Western'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Project.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, great. I sort of just want that on record because I don't want us to be in the it's a great opportunity. And there's also language in the plan about the redevelopment along Brighton Boulevard, but I wouldn't want us to be in this business of acquiring land through condemnation procedures and only to put it back on the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'market.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'No, there are very specific requirements around that with the Uniform Relocation Act, the whole process. No, it's it's very controlled. And how the city moves forward and public works and real estate move forward with these projects.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then one last bit of clarification. You know, I was told it was a public works project, The Broad, the Brighton Boulevard. But it is clearly stated in the bill this is part of the National Western Center is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The distinction is it is not within the National Western Center boundaries for the original land acquisition ordinance. It is in the National Western Center area. So Brighton Boulevard obviously is a major roadway that will support National Western. So that is why it was referenced because of that 44th to 47th block and it is being paid for from'",

We've had the ability to collect development and and and infrastructure fees at the Gateway area for the better part of eight years. And we have been collecting them and putting them in a fund.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Payments.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'In the Overland neighborhood. The subject property is in the block immediately west of Broadway, fronting Acoma Street between Iowa Avenue and Mexico Avenue. The property is just under 25,000 square feet in total. There is a single storey commercial building there.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Currently the applicant Urban Peak is requesting the rezoning to allow a redevelopment that would allow them to expand their shelter use, which is currently on site, as well as adding residential uses and some other administrative uses. And the current zoning of AIA does not allow any new residential uses to be established on the site, which is the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'reason for the rezoning request. And so again, the rezoning is from IAU oh two, which is the Billboard overlay to Annex five, which is our industrial mixed use five storey district. The surrounding zoning. The property to the north is zoned oh two to the west we have IP are to which is our heavier industrial district to the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'east along the Broadway corridor we have our urban main street three story districts and to the south is APD. That was written specifically for the storage facility that is on the site there. The surrounding uses are a pretty mixed context.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So to the West, as you would expect, there is a mix of industrial uses as well as some vacant lots and parking as well as some office mixed in there, particularly immediately across a comma from the site and then along Broadway, as you would expect, we have the mix of commercial uses.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'These are some photos to get a sense of the general context. The top photo is an image of the subject property. The middle photo there is the office building that is to the west, across Acoma Street and to the south is the bottom is the view of the building to the southwest across Acoma Street.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'property. The process so far. This matter went to planning board on January 3rd and was voted unanimously, unanimously to recommend approval and then went to the L.A. Transportation Committee on January 23rd. The public outreach, all of the appropriate notification and posting has been done.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There was a letter of support that was submitted with the application from the Overland Park registered neighborhood organization. During the process, we also received a letter of opposition from the Platte Park Peoples Association on the basis primarily of height.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we received 25 letters of support throughout the process from property owners and Denver residents, as well as two letters of opposition opposition from nearby property owners, again, primarily on the basis of height. So looking at our five review criteria to evaluate our rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The first is consistency with adopted plans. As usual, we have our two city wide plans, comprehensive plan 2000 and Blueprint, Denver. And then we have two older neighborhood plans, the Overland Park Neighborhood Plan and the Shattuck District Plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The request is generally consistent with several strategies outlined in Plan 2000, primarily related to encouraging mixed use development near transit and infill development that is in place where services and transportation exist. Different. Denver classifies the site as a mixed use, which considers a sizable employment base as well as housing.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is generally a higher intensity than you would find in other residential areas. It is an area of stability which generally means being consistent with the surrounding character, but also allowing for reinvestment. And across the coma to the west, you see the blue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It is across a coma from an industrial designation. The surrounding streets. So Acoma itself is a non-designated locale. But just up to the north a little bit is Iowa Avenue, which is a residential collector which intended to provide a balance between mobility and land access and would be the primary street that you would access the site from'",
        "'speaker_10': ', as well as Broadway being designated as an enhanced transit corridor. So this is an area that blueprint Denver is acknowledging has a higher level of transit and should continue to be that way. The Overland Park neighborhood plan is from 1993 and as such of our older plans, we don't have specific area recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There is general language about transitioning from industrial uses to residential uses. So we're not transitioning here from industrial to residential, but we are in an area of transition from industrial to commercial. And there's also recommendations related to commercial industrial businesses investing in and beautifying their sites.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So generally the request to Annex five would allow redevelopment of the site and is generally consistent with the Overland Park plan. Again, the Shattuck District plan is a little bit older plan. It's from 2003. And again, we don't have specific recommendations to the property, but there is a vision for the neighborhood to be where people live and'",

        "'speaker_10': 'redevelopment. The justifying circumstances identified here is the development along the Broadway corridor as well as the nearby transit stops. So although not within the transit buffer, we are about halfway between the I-25 and Broadway rail station and the Evans Station.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then consistency with neighborhood context, own district purpose and intent. So obviously we have a request for five stories here and we don't have any plan guidance specifically on height. So we need to look to the surrounding context to determine what an appropriate height to apply would be.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there isn't anything really above three stories in the immediate area. However, the idea and iby zoning that surrounds the property is an air base zone district. So the height that you can build is primarily based on the size of your personnel and the floor plate size that you use.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So looking at the parcels, particularly some of the large ones and the one directly across a comma from the property site could potentially build up to eight stories under the current zoning if they were to use smaller floor plates.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we do find that the IMX five is an appropriate zone district to transition from the three stories of Broadway to the industrial area to the west, and further to the tracks. So given that all five criteria have been met, Steph does recommend approval.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Basically due to a view claim that's elsewhere in the code. So I think it's incorrect to say that height is inconsistent. The proposed height of IMAX five is inconsistent with the zoning that's allowed in the area. And I would expect that given the fact that, as Sarah pointed out also, that the property is on an enhanced transit'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It's pretty clear that it is anticipated that density in the form of height would occur along Santa Fe and into the Platte River. So we believe that this proposed density is wholly consistent. With what's expected in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Additionally, the building directly to the west is a very large, already assembled parcel and there's three or four of them within a couple of blocks that would support easily six. Two eight story buildings with floor plates of 32,000 feet or more.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Michael Berman. I'm a park resident. I live at 1630 South Washington Street. Just some very brief comments. Primarily, I'm up here because the three may submit a letter of opposition, but then I don't think they sent a representative to speak.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So perhaps I represent our neighborhood and I want to make it very clear I'm very much in support of Urban Peake. It's simply opposed to the five storey building, whether that's rezoning or not. Just having a five storey building in that cadre is what I'm opposed to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just think it sets a precedent for development in that area high density development, high rise development that Black Park residents don't want. I also think it's important to recognize the park is more impacted by this site than Overland Park is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Most Overland Park residents live on the other side of Santa Fe, whereas this site is directly adjacent to Platt Park residents. So anyway, that's the reason I'm here, just to register my opposition. Thank you very much.'",

So our ownership group is very supportive of the Urban Peak's organization and their mission. However, we did submit a letter to community planning and development registering our formal opposition to the rezoning application.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I'm here this evening to reiterate to council the grounds for and reasoning behind our opposition. So. You know, we believe the proposed rezoning to five storeys is inappropriate in the neighborhood context and would be more appropriate at three stories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the basis for our opposition is that we did not believe that the rezoning application complied with the general review criteria, and we also do not believe that the justifying circumstances listed in the application were entirely accurate in terms of consistency with the neighborhood context and zoned district definitions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So talking about some of those pieces, the review criteria listed in the application includes the Evans Station Area Plan and the 25 and Broadway station area plans as the guiding documents. This property does not fall within either station area, so the Evans Station plan says that the plan will be used, quote, The plan will be used to'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Louisiana and Pearl Station. So we we don't think that those were necessarily guiding documents that they should be pointing to in terms of their review criteria and complying with. Second, the application or the rezoning letter makes multiple references to transit oriented development and the widely accepted definition of transportation development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'TODD As we know, it is development within a half mile of transit centers. And again, this property is outside of that radius at the point eight walking miles from the nearest station, which is Evans Station. Regarding justifying circumstance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The letter, the rezoning application claims that the applicant's new facility will be consistent with its current surroundings and anticipated development along the South Broadway corridor in terms of uses and density. We do not believe that five storeys is contextually appropriate in this location.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'See, this is about saving lives. If you don't want no growing homeless people, you've got to catch them now. And give them a vested interest in being a part of the city so that like this young man would want to go.'",

He stays in close contact with Decker library staff and often receives phone calls with concern about a particular youth. And he will be there within minutes to try to help in the situation, even if it's not one of our kids.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think. We have we have a responsibility to our community, to, one, be good neighbors by providing the service. And the single greatest thing we can do for the youth is get them off the streets. And so that's why I just want to ask for your support.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'But when you get to be with a young person who gets to walk into an apartment to have their own bed for the very first time in their life. That that makes this all worth it. So my last please, please support us in this change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Charles Knight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hi there. Thank you. My name is Charlie Knight. I live at 1620 South Pearl Street, and I own two rental properties in Platte Park on South Pearl and South Grant. I'm here to support the application to rezone this property to accommodate the proposed residential use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's four main reasons that I support it. One, this is an important transit oriented development location. I understand it may not be technically within the transit plans for the two stations, but last time I checked, bus service is also transit and this is a major bus thoroughfare.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I've walked outside many times and it's an easy walk from both Evans Station as well as to the Broadway Station Project and to our our retailer on Pearl. So it's a perfect location for transit oriented development, too.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The zoning is consistent with adopted plans and intent. Blueprint Denver, we heard earlier, envisions a mix of industrial, commercial, civic and residential uses for the area. The current use of primary industrial is not the highest and best use.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's primarily marijuana grow facilities and we could use a few fewer of those and more housing and retail and mixed in. And we think urban I think Urban Peak's proposed mix of housing, social services and office space in a five story structure is consistent with this vision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Three The proposed zoning is consistent with the neighborhood context, although awarded to the East a three story commercial along Broadway. As we heard earlier, other sites in the immediate area can currently be developed up to eight stories, including this large slide across the street, which could house a huge building of 230,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So this is really more about use than it is about height. The proposed five story zoning is much more esthetically appealing than what's currently possible. And because this lot slopes down to the west, it's going to feel like a four story building from Broadway.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And going from three stories to four stories doesn't seem like much of a give given the opportunity to develop some residential there. Fourth, it's the right thing to do. Supportive housing in the site is critical in addressing the affordable housing challenges that face our city and make this rezoning a matter of citywide concern.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Urban Peak's proposal to collect kid housing in the shelter with administrative and operations on one site will result in more effective outcomes and an improved relationship with Platte Park. And finally, as you know, we need more housing in Denver and allowing for this opportunity residential on this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And ultimately, I hope expanding the entire area from Evans to Broadway is going to be critical. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And our last speaker, Ben Schumacher.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. My name is Ben Shoemaker. I live at 1250 South Logan Life. I have a resident. I've known Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Probably most of my life.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I grew up in and around the South Pearl Street area. My my parents still live and own a home in East Wash Park, but they owned a business on South Pearl Street. So I have been there for over 30 years, off and on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When my wife and I are, then my girlfriend decided to buy a house. It was one of the neighborhoods that most attracted our attention. And we love it there. And I'm here tonight to speak absolutely. In support of Urban Peake.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I will tell you, I am also a member of the Park Peoples Association Board. I firmly believe we made a mistake. And I feel like we did not do a very good job of ensuring that we were representing our broader membership.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And rather we took a board vote and a little and a CFD vote, which is our Committee for a Responsible Development, but we never put it before our membership. And that left a sour taste in my mouth. And I have raised that multiple times with my fellow board members and and nobody really seemed in favor of changing'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that. So I felt it was my duty to come and tell you that. I don't believe that our letter of opposition is necessarily representative of our neighborhood. I will tell you that I strongly believe in the mission of urban peak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe in transit oriented development. I am a I'm a bike commuter. I am a transit user. My wife and I have one car, even though we have two young children, a six year old and a three year old.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Like, we need to be able to provide housing in areas that has good transit and connectivity options. And this is an excellent opportunity for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As Charlie said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The the Evans station is maybe a half mile away, maybe a little bit beyond. But it's it's a technicality. Broadway is also very nearby. The zero runs all the time. So these are all great opportunities. These are kids who probably don't, you know, almost certainly don't have cars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So they're going to find other ways to get around. There's great bike lanes down Platte River. This is actually very close to there's bike lanes that take you, you know, straight down to Logan to or not Logan technically, but whatever.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Logan to Washington and Clarkston. And you can get all over the city on bike and bus, whatever. We should be supporting these youth. We should be supporting this organization. And I believe that this is not out of context.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe that a five story building is where we should be going in this area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? All right. Sarah, would you mind coming up? Just quickly. Oh, here they come. I'll wait. Councilwoman Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's okay, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Put the ball on the dryer.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Pro-Tem, it is your district indeed. So I would defer to the questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could you? Thank you, Councilwoman. Could you? It wasn't in the presentation. I apologize if you said it, but it was. I looked back and it wasn't on the slide planning board. What was the vote?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It was unanimous.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Recommendation was unanimous. And then where this is located there you mentioned there are two transit plans that don't quite touch it. And then there's an underlying overland neighborhood plan. Yes. And how old is that Overland?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think the Overland was 93 and the Shattuck District plan is 23.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And then from my looking at the the stationary plan, so correct me if I'm wrong, they they go from usually a recommendation of three on Broadway, five the next block over up to eight, ten, something like that as you approach the rail line?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's correct. On both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sides. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. And then could I have somebody from Urban Peak come up and Christina, I apologize. Your name did not come through in my system, and I apologize for that. Could you just walk us through I know you have talked a lot about, you know, supportive housing and stuff, but can you draw, you know, paint us a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'picture of the plan, you know, five stories. What are you doing as you walk up through these stories?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sure. So the current lot has our shelter on it. And our hope is to take the building down and put it back together, as we say, and that the first floor would have the shelter, which would consist of a 40 bed shelter that could go up in numbers to 50 and our current licensing based on inclement weather'",
        "'speaker_10': 'and then also have space for minors as well because there's some licensing nuances and all of that. And then on the second story, have all of our supportive services around case management, education and employment. We've been talking about an art studio.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We'll have our administrative offices there. And one of the ways we've described it is bringing more adults on campus to really provide more services and to have the ability to provide wraparound services all day so that the way it looks right now is that folks can leave the building and then that would mean they could stay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then the third, fourth and fifth floors or apartments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And would those apartments be serving the the youth from the shelter? How do you envision that that housing working?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, that'll depend a little bit on the funding mechanisms and the tax credits and stuff, but ideally it's a continuum and that we would move people through.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The whole.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Process from shelter into some transitional pods, into.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And are there other shelters serving this population in our city?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. Not for minors?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. Just. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Those are my questions right now, Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You started the conversation about the bus travel, but I just wanted to kind of clarify the record. So, Sarah, if you can just step up real quickly, what are the bus headways on Broadway? How frequently do you know?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't know that off the top of my head. I do know that the zero does run run pretty frequently. And with the the designation in blueprint of an enhanced transit corridor, we do consider this to be appropriate to be called Tod, I think.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Yeah, I was I was going to cheat a little bit where members of the transit planning group and this is a high frequency quarter, which I think it's 15 minute headways at the worst and it's probably ten minute headways probably at rush hour.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so Clayton Gonzalez could jump for just a second. I was just going to ask about just again, to clarify the record because we had speakers in for it, but let's just get it clarified. How do the youth who are working and who come and go from your shelter tend to come and go?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How do they get to and from?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, I would say the bus the bus on Broadway, the zero is primary. They also walk quite frequently to the Broadway station and Evans station, and we provide bus tickets. So they they use either or.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay, great. Thanks. And then so I just want to get the transportation together. So, Sarah, I'm going to bring you back up for a change of topic. I want to just get at this. I think it's been touched on, but I don't I don't think we want to slow us down.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm looking at the picture in your slide show, if you can put it up and the reasoning around the site. And I was reading the staff report. And it's tricky because you've got a mix of old zoning and new zoning, and our new zoning has these handy numbers in it, but our old zoning doesn't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So can you just clarify for the properties that have and I b according to staff report, a number of those could go to eight stories or more depending on how they developed. Can you just point those out to us, please?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Using your cursor, I think the little arrow we should be able.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Does it show up on there? Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, all of these really along the west side here are the I and I b have a factor of 2.0. So if.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Air is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Floor area ratio, so that means that you can develop essentially twice the amount of floor area of the lot size. So if you have a 5000 square foot lot, you can develop 10,000 square feet worth of floor area regardless of how it's configured or height or that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we have the potential to go up to eight and then you have the three on the other side is what you were describing. Can you just show us that visually real quick?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. So a along Broadway to the north on both sides and on the east, that is our MSA three. We do have starting just to the south of this pudi on Broadway. It does go up to you at most five here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And then I just wanted to ask in terms of the the record we're establishing here, a couple of folks mentioned the area sorry, the station areas and that this is not in it. But can you just clarify for me just let's eliminate the transit piece altogether.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In other areas of the city, do we regularly transition between three and eight with the five in between? Is that something that occurs in other areas of the city, main streets, for example, or other areas that don't have?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I would say that's good planning policy. I can't think of anything specifically. But generally, when we talk about transitions in height, it does go generally three, five, eight, 12, 20.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There's nothing inconsistent about this, even absent the fact that it's not in the train. Tods However, we've established that it is in the bus rapid transit. Tod. Okay. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Sir, could you walk me through the analysis that occurs at CPD when you look at these applications and you look at the uniformity of district regulations because. The way it's explained here seems a little bit at odds with how I've understood it, which is that it's uniform here as elsewhere.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But here, when I read the staff report, basically you're saying that it's, you know, it'll result in the uniform application of the zone district standards. I mean, that's that's a tautology. Of course it does. When we put a zone district in there, you follow those regulations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, yes, it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'True that it is a little bit of a strange criteria. I mean, the language that's in the staff report is pretty consistent with how we evaluate it. In past staff reports, the best way to describe it is there is nothing different about this IMX five request than other IMX five zoning in the city.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So for example, there are no waivers or conditions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what I'm getting at. So that's it's not specific to this site. The uniformity of district regulations is not specific to this site. Do you know what the conditions are on the PD to the south?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't I do know that it's pretty specifically written for that that storage facility. And then in terms, you know, some of our older beauties are very specific and they were written for existing buildings to allow or to build very specific buildings that that is very specifically related to what's on the ground there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then right south of there, you have along Broadway, you have aa5 story zone. Correct. So half a block away. Yes. Is a five story you know, five story buildings aren't yet, though?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I don't believe so. Not within this immediate proximity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then again, just a little bit south of there is eight story.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yes. As you move closer to the real stations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. That's almost president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Clayton. Christina During construction, you said you're taking the building down. Where will the kids go during construction?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that'll depend on when the building and when that transition happens. But there have been a number of these projects that happen, and Volunteers of America has provided some space for the Dolores project and there have been other situations like that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've had some early conversations about that and we'll be very dependent on time, but that's a big piece of our planning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as far as the the space you have now, Clayton was kind enough to take me for a tour a few months ago. And then in the new facility, just the the basic shelter level will be the same amount of space per kid or how will that work?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, I think the way we think about it is that the whole.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Floor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Will have some of that same services, but in different layouts. And so there are requirements for licensing about how much space people get. But it'll be a similar footprint that will expand a.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Little bit.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Based on it, because there's a fair amount of open space and parking around.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And yeah, just wondering, as you envision it, since we're talking about clients that will most probably not be driving cars. What's what's what are thoughts about parking on the on for this project?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So there will be parking that's underneath the plan has been underground parking that will be available for. All the folks that work and live there and stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's what I'm got. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Accountable 43 is closed. Comments by members of council. And I'll take the first shot since this is in my district. First of all, I want to thank everybody for coming down here, sitting in the hard seats, participating in the public process, adding your voice to it'",
        "'speaker_0': '. I think that that is such an important thing and you have way more important things to do and be out and you chose to be here. And I appreciate that, especially for me. This is in a community where I live.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so to see people who are not just constituents but who are neighbors and who are friends taking time out of their life to come down here and speak up, even when we don't all agree, is a really important part of the process.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know, I also want to thank Urban Peake for everything that you do for our community. It's a it's an amazing resource and just an incredible organization. I think that a lot of the conversation in opposition came around the height issue, and I'll just use this as a moment to say we need more resources for the folks'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at CPD, that we can get more of our neighborhood plans done. And we're not looking at neighborhood plans from 1993, and we're not working with communities like Platte Park who don't have have never had a neighborhood plan. They've never had the opportunity to sit down with planners to talk about what is our plan for our community.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And there is a lot of stress happening right now. You have the former Gates site that is blowing up with huge use by right buildings. You have Pearl Street, which was a quaint trolley corridor. We're literally there for buildings that have been demolished on Pearl Street in the last year and a half.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And that's causing a lot of stress because we've never had a community conversation about what we want. And now all of a sudden, here's another ask for another big building that's coming in to the neighborhood. And I think it's so critical that we get those resources.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I love that we've moved from a 70 year plan to a 15 year plan. We've got to get a lot better than that because 15 years from now, there won't be anything left on Pearl Street and parts of Platte Park if we don't come up with a plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I, I think that a lot of the opposition centered around this height idea, and I think that it is really hard when you're looking at the site and you see a lot of one story buildings to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How is this in context to have a five story building? But that's not what we're tasked with looking at. We're looking at what is the current use by right on those properties and the nearest plans that we have and the best plans that we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think that this does meet the legal criteria for a rezoning. And while it is not part of the our deliberation or our legal criteria, what ultimately gets built there, we're looking at these criteria and does it meet it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think it's been demonstrated that it did. I think Planning Board had a great conversation about the letter from Plat Park and appreciating the effort to talk to those criteria. But that again, you can't look at what's existing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have to look at what could be under the use by. Right. And they and they tackled that well but I think that I lost my train of thought. But the in addition to it, that's where I was in addition to it meeting the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And while this doesn't play into it, I think that this is a critical thing for our city to have an organization that serves this clientele. And I think that it's a little bit terrifying to know that there's only one, you know, and that we should have lots of resources for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, you want to talk about the most vulnerable people in our community and you want to talk about the success stories. I can't think of an organization that is closer to serving the needs that we have in a growing city that is so expensive and more expensive today than it was yesterday to find a way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And and so, again, what doesn't meet the criteria, I think that here's an opportunity to have an organization that is lucky enough to own the land and not be forced out as development is coming to this part of our city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And to build permanent supportive housing and affordable housing and to be targeted at this corridor is something that is critically needed. And so thank you for stepping up and for looking at this and looking at what did meet the criteria and coming in and proposing it in front of us.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So with all that being said and getting a little rambly here, I will say I will be supporting this tonight and I hope my colleagues will as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilman Espinosa Bramley on zoning. That's my job. You know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I didn't say that rambling.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, the I'll be supporting this as well and I like the the president pro Tim's initial comments. I'm going to deviate just because it is in context. We have we have citywide plans. We have stationary plans. We have a small area, neighborhood plan, small area plans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think in this whole Denver process, I think we need to add immediate area plans. And why I say that is because by the time we get done with the Neighborhood Plan Initiative, we will be three quarters of the way through our 20 year plan that we're working out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Update that we're working on right now. And those those neighborhoods that are leading that charge will also be 15 years. You know, they'll have a plan that is closer to being expired and irrelevant than they will be to anything that they have that is current.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so there are things that that are that are consistent with our adopted plans, but that are radically different than existing conditions. And that I wish we had a tool for conversation not just on that parcel, but you're going to have public meetings anyway.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Talk about that area and how things how this might actually inform the things going forward rather than have these little one offs. And so it's just I wanted to say that because it was something that just popped into my head the way things do, this idea of this immediate area plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President, I. It's funny how life works sometimes. I see the folks who are sitting here in our pews here in the council chambers with a an idea that's way long overdue to address an issue that is not going away any time soon.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that's. You know, and listening to the criteria and having this, you know, the application in front of us, it makes sense. I mean, it makes absolute sense. The population that urban peak serves is a special population because there are young people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they absolutely deserve everything that this city can do to back them up for the future, to prepare them for the future. So many of them do not have the luxury of having parents teaching them how to dress for a job interview.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or to pay rent. Or dare I say, being able to go to school and get your diploma. And the staff over at Urban Peak every single day does the jobs that so many kids deserve to have and so many people, so many kids and so many children in our and our city have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, let me just say, there's so many. People in our community don't realize that they. Have and they take for granted every single day. Irene. I know this intimately because in 2002 I was an employment counselor over at Urban Peak.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I worked every single day with a growing caseload. And it was probably one of the hardest jobs I ever had. Now hard because of the caseload, but hard because it was just every day I struggled to go home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I went home. And these youngsters. Had these beds in a shelter. And we you know, what we do with what we what we could with that building. But it just was never enough. Never enough and not enough space.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we would have our G.E.D. classes we had at the cafeteria. You know, we had a small little desks where our youngsters would come and hang out and figure out how we inundate places like Coors Field with all of our kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With jobs in the summer with the biggest issue space over there. We had a rent out space across the way on Iowa. Just so we can have our team meetings. And talk about the different cases and different kids.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. I can't think of a more unjustified rezoning in this area for something like this. This is a very easy yes for me. I know with that space with the but this the possibilities that exist. Imagine what Urban Peake has done and its in its history and its existence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Imagine. Up to now. Imagine what they can do from here on out. Right. And so this rezoning allows that it it allows them to expand, to grow and to serve the kids. Absolutely needs somebody to have their back every single day in a safe place to be and a place that feels like.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Paul. So I'm very happy to see you all here. I'm very happy to support this rezoning, Mr. President. And I'm kind of jealous because I thought a long time ago, especially in 2010, I should have redistricted this precinct in my district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But the problem is, is it has to be contiguous and that just is not going to fly. So, anyway, I'm super supportive of this. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez and I will entertain no hostile takeover of my district. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. 1980 889. Urban peak started am I am I right in that. Yeah I hate the throw and I remember the olden days at sure. But in my career as a journalist, I remember when Urban Peak opened its doors a few blocks from my office, and I remember hearing that it was the only shelter'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in the front range of the state at that point that specifically served homeless youth. And I was stunned. I was just stunned and so grateful that that business had moved into our area and have watched it over the years through your predecessors and other staff things and so on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it was always the one thing that remained consistent is you were lifting kids off the street, out of out of the cold. I mean, this is as far as. Emotionally, morally and an extremely easy, easy lift. But we're charged with certain criteria to to approve these rezonings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't minimize the concerns over height. I never do. But I'm comfortable that the existing zoning with the floor area ratio options. Provides that option for height along that corridor. But the one thing of all the criteria that struck me this time is the pub serving the public health and safety.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm going to do something I don't know that I've ever done and I'm going to quote brother, say, coup, that if you don't want homeless adults, you got to do something about homeless kids. Right. And that is exactly I mean, when city council met a couple of months ago, now looking at our priorities for the next'",
        "'speaker_4': 'year, how affordable housing and homelessness was top of the list. And this deals with both. This deals with both for our at risk. One of the communities that really is not equipped to take care of itself without a great big leg up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm thrilled with this project. I think it has the opportunity to not just transform the organization, but to transform our community. So. I'm extremely happy to support this. And the last thing I wanted to throw in, you know, I've also worked with the Overland neighborhood again, but in my time before council and through their trials and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tribulations about the Shattuck site and all that stuff. And I've known a lot of people in that community over the years. And I'm just guessing and this is just, you know, not an official position, but I'm guessing they'd be real happy to approve this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's what I've got. Thanks, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. The Overland neighbors did vote on this and it was unanimous at that meeting. Councilman Neal.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm proud to support this rezoning. Also, you know, we look at the homeless population in Denver. In the last count, about 5000 homeless on the street. One of the when you talk to the police or the homeless services, the one of the largest increases in our youth, in our homeless population.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so I'm so proud of the work that Urban Peak's doing to address the youth. And and I especially, like Councilman Cashman mentioned this, but I look at the youth, so here's a group of disadvantage that we can probably make a real difference with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We can catch them young and help them prosper and grow and council them and and help them become productive citizens that have a quality of life. So I just really think you're doing a wonderful job and I and I look forward to seeing you continue your services.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So much. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Of course, the issue of the use of this building isn't the issue before us this evening is the zoning that's before us. And on that count, I see that the case has been well made.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Councilman Clarke also mentioned this, but the the the rise from three stories to five stories to eight stories is something that we see quite often in the city. The fact of having residential near transit oriented development makes a lot of sense.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The density makes a lot of sense for that. I know that it might not be close to the stations, but it's close to Broadway, which is a very large transit corridor for us. And so the case for the zoning is well made.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think the the fact of its use just gives it a little bit more value to us. And you think about three stories and five stories and think about what's going to be used. If it were only going to be three stories, we would lose two thirds of the opportunity to provide homeless with transitional housing or or'",
        "'speaker_8': 'affordable housing. So even the zoning issue of 3 to 5 stories has a special meaning for all of us. So I will be supporting this as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Seeing no other comments, Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black eye Espinosa, i Flynn. I Gilmore, i. Herndon, i. Cashman. I can eat i. Lopez I knew.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sussman Yeah. Hi.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close voting and note the results.'",
        "'speaker_2': '11 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 Eyes. Comfortable. 8.0043 has passed and seen no other business before this party. This meeting is adjourned.'"
