And I am grateful for all the service providers we have in the Denver community that work with people in Denver who are dealing with this situation. I serve on the board of a nonprofit that provides housing for people with AIDS.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'It's our seventh annual Rise Up event that we've organized for the last four years. We've been at the Denver Indian Center, and it's definitely been a great opportunity for people, the community, to come together and learn about how to protect themselves, how to how to be able to kind of look at it holistically as well and be'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And, and luckily we have haven't had very many positive tests come back. I remember a couple of years ago we had a young man from Longmont, 18 years old, who found out he was positive and wouldn't have otherwise known if he hadn't come to the event.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I would echo the sentiments of Congress, Councilwoman Ortega not having to have these kind of proclamations and events. But in the meantime, we continuously have to do that. So with that, I'll go ahead and hand it over to Jaylene and Cindy if they would like to offer some comments.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'It's pretty alarming to see the rates of which youth 13 to 25 are being diagnosed with HIV. Women, youth, people of color. I mean, it's it's scary. And so we need to take our own efforts in really protecting ourselves and others, as well as doing our best to educate our community to minimize the stigma of HIV.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's a huge piece. I think if we were to do that, we'd be able to understand one another, be a little bit more compassionate, and really be able to to minimize the risk and incidence of HIV across all of our communities and across the globe.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I thank each and every one of you. We'd love to invite you on this Friday to come to our Rise Up event at the Denver Indian Center. 6 p.m. There's free food again, free testing. We'll be doing free HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea testing as well.'",

Teach you something about HIV that maybe you didn't know before and can spread the message on to a niece, nephew, child, even your own parents.'",

Um, we come from the social, economic standpoint because we deal with people that are drug addicted, whether that's intravenous drugs or they suffer from alcoholism, homelessness, the whole factors that perpetuate this problem.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And from our standpoint, we recognize that on the reservations prior to them coming here, the reservations are so distant from the cities or health care in general. Some of the youth and some of the people affected with HIV and AIDS, they don't they don't get the help that they need.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sometimes the nearest health facility is over an hour away on the remote areas of the reservation. So yeah, education.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is part of it, but part of it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is access to the facilities. Again, we get some of these people here from the reservations and when they come here, their problem is adjusting to a city environment. And so.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Councilman Creech. Your pregnancy is a lot more because we still have a lot of work to do on our project. But yes, we have made considerable outreach to the affordable housing community, and we are very well schooled in affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, we're very committed to pursuing affordable housing on the site, and we are very excited about the opportunities that we are seeing an interest from affordable housing developers that will be doing the vertical development once we get through our steps with the horizontal development and obviously with a big step being tonight with the infrastructure improvements'",
        "'speaker_3': '. And that's a big step for the the vertical developers for us to have infrastructure and especially a nice four acre park for the project as well as our rezonings that we'll need for the remaining 30 acres. That which is why you'll be seeing us a few more times and that those rezonings obviously will, will, you know, follow'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, counsel. We can count on you to tell you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Mr. Berger, I think you might be the best one for me to ask my questions up, if you wouldn't mind coming back to the microphone. Now, Mr. Berger. What is the exact name of the water and sewer district that you represent?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'North Washington Street Water and Sanitation District.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's independent of Denver water in our Denver wastewater system, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, we work we get our water from Denver water, and it goes through our system and we work with Denver. In fact, we just what raised the issue was we just included a part of Denver based upon an agreement with Denver wastewater on an Asarco redevelopment project.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And this is nearby. So I was a little concerned about overlapping, but after hearing the proponents discuss, it sounds like it won't be overlapping our district's boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, thank you. I have another question for one of the other speakers, I believe Mr. Nieman. So my question is about the infrastructure that will be built on site. So the roads, the parks. You know, we've seen sort of some master plan designs that have come through on previous applications before this body.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So is it anticipated that. The infrastructure is maintained by the the metro district, or is it an expectation that the roads and the parks get turned over to the city and the city is expected to maintain them?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Council Ortega. It is the expectation that all public buildings, with the exception of certain storm drainage improvements and certain baca curb improvements, will be ultimately dedicated and maintained by the city. There is a four proximate four acre open space park that will be constructed, that the district will be districts when one or both of them'",
        "'speaker_3': 'will be responsible for maintaining until such time as the city accepts it and the warranty periods expire, at which point it will be formally dedicated over to the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And is there a warranty period on the streets?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It will, yes. It would follow the normal dedication process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So what is that normal time frame?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I believe it's two years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. I know this is an issue that has come up with some of our tax increment financing districts in terms of the added costs that the city has to incur as a result of them becoming city streets and parks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so that's why I wanted to understand this, because we're trying to ensure that the districts that are creating the infrastructure sort of handle that responsibility until in the case of a TIFF district, until the tiff has expired.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, we're not completely there as as a, you know, a formal body in the administration ensuring that we're all on the same page with that. But, you know, that is a concern because when you have these big districts, it just adds that much more.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I get this will be new infrastructure. So the maintenance should be probably less than some of our other streets in the adjacent neighborhood that are not paved and have no sidewalks and some of those things. But thank you for answering that question.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let me see if I have any more. I think that's it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Noon.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Johnson. So do you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Um, Councilman. Oh, that's a car owner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, no problem. I'm subbing for Anderson. Right. So it's not a problem.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just looking at revenue sources on page 24 and 25 of the first document just. And the Avalon of the 50 mills. Well, what is going to be the average cost used in the 50 mills on an average price of a home in that area?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What do you think the increase will be?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we have those numbers quickly? Well, maybe. It's an easy calculation. It's an easier calculation. We can do the calculation pretty much as if you had we we have rough averages of the 84 that home. I think they had averages of around 350,000.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Zach. For average home sales. Okay so so what you do you can use your if they had a they have a. The way this works is developer will put a model of what they think the the home price will be for the sale and then we can do an average of what we think the home sale price'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would be. So if you use a average home sale price of $350,000 and then times up by the assessment ratio. I'm looking for Zach to pull the numbers real quick.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As a calculator. Yeah, if he's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got a calculator quick, you can fool the $350,000 times the 7.97% ratio.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So let me just do this here real quick. So if we had a home of $350,000. Times. .0796 times .001 times 50. It's about 1300 hours for about 1400 hours for the year for 50 meals on a $300,000 home.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. On page 25 is talking about a1a fee there, a facilities fee. There's like $3,000 for single family and 1500 dollars for a multi-unit family unit. Is that a one time fee? It's going to be, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's the one time fee that would be charged. I think probably at the time of sale.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At the time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or the builder fee, actually, you can sell it to the builder to pay.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Their existing homes in that area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, they're not.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'All brand new, right? That's correct. Okay. Thank you. Grill. But what about your rental projects? Are you still thinking about rental building on rental units or are you going to jump into like that capsule in connection to the condo market?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or if Councilman Kennedy would like to sign personally on guarantees? That's that's fantastic. But so far, we're not I don't have the appetite, you know, to to engage in any kind of construction. But, you know, we're we're seeing, you know, a little bit of a little bit of interest from the condo developers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, we've always had the interest from some that are lot smaller scale and would not come under the auspices of some of the trial attorneys. But, you know, we have not seen any large scale condos yet, but we just it would be a fantastic addition to our project and talk about affordability.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It could really get really, you know, be a great bolster for the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, we sure hope you'll consider it. And Mr. Broadwell is going to protect you there. So let me ask you a question about this tax. What do you think this everyone tax is going to be on your project?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What do you think the total will be for you and what do you think that you'll probably have to pass on to your rental units?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. In regards to what.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Level of tax on your property you're going to have this you're going to have larger you know, you're going to have 300 units or.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think we projected seven, 750 units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. What do you think the the property tax bill would be for you for that?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That would. I do not know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I may need a calculator.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Get that big calculator on that one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Are you looking for. I'm sorry, the total tax revenue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just like to know what? His tax bill. He's going to be the property underwriters. So he'll be paying that tax rate. And so. So then I'm sure you'll pass that on in to rental for your use. If you just let me know what that information is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, just. I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. New council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not sure who the appropriate person would be to answer this, but looking in the presentation, it outlines 450 single family residences and knowing that the Metro District Board will be initially set up with large land owners in the area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Where do you see or is there going to be a transition when residents of those 450 single family units might look towards elections to serve on the metro district board?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilmember Gilmore. The natural life cycle of of a district basically is as residents come into the district and own property there, they become eligible electors of the district. The at this organizational election coming up in May of this two months I guess there'll be and each district there'll be three board members who have a four'",
        "'speaker_3': 'year term which will expire in May 2020 and two. That will have a two year term that will expire in May 2018 and that's statutorily set. Basically, it depends on the phasing of development in how quickly single family residents move in there and and renters other times, I think is going to be renters when moving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're basically there can be as dependent on how development continues there can be new board members as of May 2018 if they are voted out. So they'll be a full term. A full house will turn over the board in May 2020.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Can you confirm Will is the board set up currently with five members?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, it's a five member board, and that's usually the default for a special district.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And will it stay at five members or as you have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'New property owners, come.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'In through the single family residences? Will the board grow?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It'll stay at five. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gummer. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you. Real quick. I was listening to the question for my council colleague, councilman, to whom I worked together a lot. And so I said, we're developing the mind meld. But I just wanted to check really quickly.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Graham, if you could clarify, are you can you please describe which piece of the development your company is doing and then which pieces will be done by others? Because I think, Councilman, you may have been asking you for information you might not have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I just want to make sure that we all are clear on your role before we close out the hearing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Councilman. So we are only the horizontal developer. We control the entire 41 acres. So we are just, you know, putting in the streets and national attention and the parks. And the plan is for us to sell to vertical developers.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we do are the the financing plan that we came up with to support the districts is just is based upon, you know, some what we think, you know, could happen here and with a mixture of different housing types, different price points, mix of of of single family and multifamily housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But we are just the horizontal developer and we do not have plans to to be the vertical developer of the product at this time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Kenny. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just wanted to ask if it looks like at this point that the the building, the Denver Post building, if any of that stays or if it's expected that that goes? Or is that proposed just to be an interim use?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A former competing newspaper guy. So don't listen to what he's saying.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You know, I may abstain from answering that question just as I don't you know, I don't want to upset Councilman Flynn, but we do not have any firm plans for the demolition of that building at this time. You know, we still have some some some very interesting ideas for the repurposing of that building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, you know, there there there does still need to be the infrastructure put into to make the building more accessible and to, you know, add add things like the park and, you know, bring in a mix of uses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that is a very large building and there are no plans, you know, either way at this point. We continue to explore, you know, the the opportunities as well as get the pieces in place that we can start redeveloping the entire site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So assuming you have seriously interested folks that wouldn't require the demolition, do you anticipate in the interim continuing to see things like Denver fully back there?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We that was that was a phenomenal event. And we absolutely want them to continue. And it's really helped, you know, for people to actually see where this is and be in the building. And so we're absolutely exploring, you know, bigger and better things for for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we I've thought about this building every day for eight and a half years. And so I would love to see the building stay. And, you know, but it's you know, we're really excited about bringing a mix of users into the site.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Any other questions on Caterpillar? So nine. CNN public hearing is now closed. Time for comments. Councilman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have not consulted with my colleague, Councilman Brooks, but this is in his district, and I know that he would not want us to allow a project of this magnitude to go forward without some comment of support.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To say that we are excited about the potential. I know that he has spent a lot of time thinking about the importance of transit oriented development in his district. And and so I, I want to appreciate, again, how much time this team has spent getting to know the council, getting to know some of the visions we have'",
        "'speaker_5': 'for TOD in the city and really helping to, you know, marry the vision that you have had for this eight and a half years with some of the plans and visions the city has. So it's never easy doing a project of this scale.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But but the infrastructure is the beginning of it. So I want to thank you for the time you spent and wish you luck with the next phases. And I will be supporting this metropolitan district tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So technically, this site is in the Globeville neighborhood, and I know that the applicant has had conversations with folks from Globeville, as well as the Sunnyside neighborhood. And yesterday, actually, I went and drove around on the west side of the tracks and both the Sunnyside and the Globeville neighborhood adjacent to this Tod stop'",
        "'speaker_9': '. That will be opening, I think, next year. Right. Is is seeing a lot of interest. We this body has risen several other properties to the south of this site that are hoping to do some TOD development. And my hope is, as we see more and more investment, we're having a separate conversation about sidewalks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And, you know, this is an area that still has no streets and no sidewalks. And so I'm hoping that as a city, we get to a place where all of our neighborhoods have that basic infrastructure. I'm not asking the developer to do that for the rest of the neighborhood, although that would be nice.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But, you know, it's it's one of those things that I think we're continuing to look at in terms of how we have that basic infrastructure consistent all across the city. But I want to commend the developer for their commitment in addressing the affordable housing issue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I don't have to tell you what a challenge this is across the city for people who want to live in Denver that can't afford the prices. And so just knowing that that's a commitment you're making is very much appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to pile on. The affordable housing element of this was real interesting when this project came before council originally, I guess last fall or maybe it was even late summer. And I got the feeling from the team that I think they kind of thought it was just going to be a perfunctory'",
        "'speaker_8': 'visit and sell along. And one by.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'One, I'm aware that that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That topic of affordable housing came up and which is a priority of this council. And the project kind of went on hold for a while. And it's my understanding, as has been alluded to, that you folks did a lot of outreach into the affordable housing community, which is a great start.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it's only a start. And I am aware you are horizontal developers and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're the guys that pick out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The vertical developers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the responsibility lays with you to continue.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Step to and do everything you can to fulfill the vision that I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Believe is shared.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That there be a a robust, affordable housing component to to this project. So I want to thank.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You for.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Putting it on halt.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rethinking.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And coming back with a broader approach. And I look forward to supporting this this evening.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman and Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just a few brief comments that this project has been long in coming, and I really welcome it. It's a I think it's a fabulous redevelopment site near the 41st and FOX Station, not light rail, but commuter rail.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They haven't announced an opening date yet, but when I left the project, it was expected to be around October sometime in the mid fall. And quite a historic site as well as the Argo smelter used to be there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and then, of course, the Denver Post printing plant. And it's good to see some activity, some residential, some commercial activity coming to that area at one time. Maybe I should've asked this during the hearing, but at one time, the investors included coach Mike Shanahan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I don't know if he's still involved in the group or not. So there's a long history of trying to get this thing off the ground. And I'm glad to see that you're finally there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Any other comments? Constable 79. CNN Madam secretary, welcome.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can each.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lopez new Ortega I assessment I black eye. Clark. Hi, Flynn. Hi. Gilmore Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. Madam Secretary, please. Those are only now the results. 11 eyes 911, 979 has been placed on file. Consideration does pass. Well, that's the bell. So seeing no other business before this body, this meeting is adjourned.'"
