    "Text Amendment to Denver Zoning Code for Active Centers and Corridors Design Overlay.": [
        "'speaker_6': 'So a portion of a larger project would need to provide something other than residential at that ground floor facing the street. There's also a number of of more qualitative standards that get to this notion of maintaining a strong street wall and sort of main street character, but also allowing for greater flexibility and pedestrian movement through a variety'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of setbacks and more flexible range of where the building can actually be located, creating better transitions between the public sidewalk and private residential units when there are residential uses at that ground floor, and then supporting very highly active street levels with tall ground floors and many windows across those frontages.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this is a this is a brief summary, and I won't get into each one of these individually, but I do have some slides if anyone has questions about these going forward. But this is a summary of what's what's in the design overlay itself.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, most fundamentally, as I mentioned, it would does have a standard to provide nonresidential active uses for just a portion of that primary street frontage on larger sized lots. Limits the building forms to the shop front and townhouse.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Make some changes to the build to range. Again, sort of allowing greater flexibility for that building to be set away from that primary street zone online a little bit, provide some more space for outdoor dining in pedestrian areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some setbacks that I mentioned, and then limiting the transparency alternatives in areas within the overlay to only be allowed to be to meet that alternative through the permanent art. So really, we're looking for windows and we want to make sure that we get the highest level of transparency possible.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then finally, a minimum floor to floor height for that street level. And that's really sort of leaning towards making sure that these projects and future future buildings are designed in such a manner that they can accommodate those nonresidential uses at some point in the future.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I should clarify to a nonresidential use in this case and in this particular zoning district doesn't mean that it specifically has to be retail or it has to be a coffee shop or a food and beverage of some kind.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It really runs the entire range of things like neighborhood services, health care services, the dentist, the dog groomer, you know, any number of things that could be considered and would be permitted as a nonresidential use. I also mentioned this design overlay and in the text amendment that will establish this and the Denver zoning code picks up an'",
        "'speaker_6': 'inconsistency in the shopfront form and in all of the other contexts within the zoning code, the shopfront form does not allow parking between either the primary or the side street. And for whatever reason, in the urban context, which is Article five, that was a little was inconsistent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so we've made that change as well in all of our our X, M, X and s districts. And that parking would not be allowed between surface parking, I should say, would not be allowed between the building in the primary or the side street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So moving into the rezoning itself, we'll, of course, look at at the overview of the existing context through the zoning land use and then existing building performance scale. As I mentioned this, these areas are a range of different mixed use and main street zoned districts, they range in scale from two storey to three storey and up to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'five storey in a couple of locations. A few of these areas also included the UO one and two, which is the use overlay one and two that were sort of carryovers of of older zoning and older entitlements that are applied to these areas.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other one is the adult use overlay, and two is the billboard use overlay. And you can see there in the surrounding areas, generally these areas are bordered either by a two unit zone district or a single unit zone district in the urban context as far as land use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As you might expect, there's actually quite a large range of things that are happening in these various areas. They primarily there are commercial and retail. There is a mix of multi-unit residential office and mixed use type of properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You can see in particularly the northern part of Tennyson, which is the which is the long section here in the in the middle of the of the graphic, particularly on the western side of Tennyson in that area that has really transitioned almost exclusively over to multi-unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we'll look at a photograph or two that shows that. So zooming in here, this is this is the portion of Tennyson from 38 to 46 that is being considered for the rezoning. It sort of runs the range in terms of scale from one story, traditional commercial type of non type of buildings up to three and even'",
        "'speaker_6': 'five story multi-unit residential structures, some new, some old. As you move further north, this is where that rapid transition has really has really happened and really raised a lot of the concerns from the neighborhood and has over the last several years about changes to add to this portion of Tennyson that did used to provide some local commercial'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and neighborhood goods and services, but has really rapidly transformed over to almost almost exclusively residential projects. This is the area around 44th and Sheridan. Again know it's generally going to be mixed use and commercial and retail and it's existing patterns.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It also has one story more sort of traditional type of commercial buildings, but then also some more suburban type of examples where you where you see the surface parking is located generally between the building and the street. Here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is up near Regis University. So this is at 49th and 50th Avenue. And Lowell, again, kind of a range and a mix of some convenience store or drive thru type of uses, some one story traditional commercial buildings and then portions of this section have also transitioned over to multi-unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': '44th in Lowell. Again, sort of a mix of things, the one and two storey commercial buildings and then some other more suburban type of development where the buildings are set away from the street. And then finally, this last section along the north side of 38, which is just east of east of Sheridan here, again, sort of a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'mix of lower scale, lower scale commercial and some residential components here as well. So the overall outreach has has been ongoing for a number of years now. CPD has been involved directly with with Berkeley, Regis United Neighbors, which is the local registered neighborhood organization since at least the fall of 2017.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So this goes back to even to former Councilman Espinosa for this area. And those initial conversations about what what kinds of things an overlay might include. Really, it took it took on a lot more momentum once once Councilmember Sandoval got got into you know, got into her position.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And her office has really taken on the bulk of the of the public outreach through a number of different mailers and fliers, media advisories and town halls that were that were held in the spring of last year. Unfortunately, right around the time that the pandemic started to started to take shape.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so they they did a lot of additional direct conversations and outreach, really, through the spring and summer of last last year. And then finally we presented to the IMC Zoning and Planning Committee back in November of last year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Process has similarly moved through the standard protocols and procedures. The informational notice of both the text amendment and Map amendment were in November of last year and the planning board meeting was noticed in January and the hearing was in February.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Moved on to council committee. And then here we are this evening on a Tuesday instead of a monday. As far as public comments, we have received a letter of support from from the R.A. from Berkeley, Regis for United Neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They submitted a letter of support to the planning board. And I believe we're also going to submit a direct letter to the council members as well. We've also received 24 letters of support from from various various neighbors and really speak to and cite this desire to maintain and enhance the walkability of these these areas and ensure the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'continuation of commercial activity is provided by local small businesses. One of those letters in support was actually conditional, recommending that we didn't go far enough and that there were some additional strategies they would like to see to strengthen that overlay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then we have also received four comments in opposition, generally citing concerns relative to the timing and the applicability of the new overlay potential increase in construction costs. And that residential uses really should be the focus for these locations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Moving into the review criteria, there are three. For this rezoning, we'll be looking at consistency with adaptive plans and then uniformity of district regulations and furthering public health, safety and welfare. So we'll start with adopted plans and move directly into a comprehensive plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': '2040. I do think it's important to call out there's there's a number of different things that speak to this notion of complete neighborhoods and a mix of uses. But I really do want to highlight a couple that come from the strong and authentic neighborhoods strategy.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You go one strategy and to build a network of well connected, vibrant, mixed use centers and corridors, and then to encourage quality infill development that is consistent with the surrounding neighborhood and offers opportunities for increased amenities. Moving on to Blueprint Denver then and looking at the urban context, mapping this entire area falls into the urban context.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Generally, development should be compatible with the existing neighborhood character and offer residents a mix of uses with good street activation and connectivity. Future place type. All of these rezoning areas, except for one very small site, fall into the local corridor and center categories, characteristics of these of these types of areas in the future that they primarily provide'",
        "'speaker_6': 'options for dining, entertainment and shopping. They could include some residential and employment uses. The scale is intimate with that focus on the pedestrian. The one area that does fall into the residential low category actually has an existing commercial use on it currently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's something that the neighborhood and the councilmember was interested in reinforcing and perpetuating into the future. The, let's say, future street types, both 44th and lower fall in the mixed use collector category. And then Tennison is a main street collector and then 38 falls in the category of Main Street Arterial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Generally, these have similar descriptions of a varied mix of uses, including some residential. They are typically multi-story with high building coverage and a shallow setback. It is within the all areas of all other areas of the city as far as growth strategies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that means that roughly 10% of the jobs and 20% of housing by 2040 should be absorbed into these types of areas. And then getting into some specific strategies that Blueprint and Denver directs and really establishes some policies that are supportive of this of this rezoning is that in in the general the land use and built for'",
        "'speaker_6': 'general policies policy number 11 is to implement our plan recommendations through citywide legislative rezonings and text amendments. So that's exactly what we're doing here this evening. And then more importantly, on the qualitative side, in the design, quality and preservation policy, number four speaks to ensuring an active and pedestrian friendly environment that provides true mixed use character in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'our centers and corridors, and specifically strategy A speaks directly to what we're what we're doing here this evening of requiring strong street level, active use standards for local centers and corridors. And this may include a prohibition on residential units for a portion of the street level building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'As far as the equity analysis overall, these areas in Berkeley and Regis relative to access to opportunity are rated as having moderate access. This is a result of having relatively lower access to transit and grocery stores, but higher access to existing local centers and corridors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to make sure that we're supporting supporting that and helping to, you know, ultimately provide additional access. The proposed overlay in the rezoning, we think, will further increase that access to opportunity by encouraging walkability within these areas and ensuring that new development is including those nonresidential uses that could contribute to jobs and services and other'",
        "'speaker_6': 'amenities. So we find that the rezoning application would have a net positive impact on the area's access to opportunity. As far as vulnerability to displacement, the Berkeley areas are indicated as low vulnerability to displacement, while the Regis has a slightly higher moderate vulnerability.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The region's score is is partly due to a slightly higher percentage of the population that has less than a college degree. The proposed overlay is not anticipated to significantly impact vulnerability to displacement. However, it may actually help with some employment displacement because, again, by ensuring that nonresidential space continues to be offered in the future and new development'",
        "'speaker_6': ', it will open up and provide space to be available and hopefully more affordable to local businesses. So we find that the rezoning would not have a negative impact on this measurement and that housing and businesses would not be displaced as a result of the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Housing. Housing diversity. Both Berkeley and Regis areas are indicated as low to moderate housing diversity. They're generally diverse in terms of their home size, but not necessarily diverse in terms of middle density housing or homeownership opportunities compared to rental.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We found that looking at the rezoning because there is a limitation on the residential uses at the ground floor, there may be a very slight impact on overall housing diversity. Just just because there may be slightly fewer units that are generated because of that requirement to provide some nonresidential use of the ground floor.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And then finally, jobs, diversity. The subject areas within Berkeley and Regis generally have low to moderate density in terms of in terms of the number of jobs overall, they sort of fall in the category of retail innovation, jobs near the university and lower and manufacturing diversity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we think that the proposed rezoning may have a positive impact on job diversity in the neighborhood. Again, sort of going back to the notion of having more commercial or nonresidential space available and the opportunities that that may present to new businesses and local, local employment.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we think that overall, we find that the rezoning application would have a positive effect on the area's job diversity. We also find that the requested rezoning would meet the next two criteria. It would result in uniformity of district regulations and would further the public health, safety and welfare primarily through the implementation of our adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So staff recommends that City Council approves the Denver Zoning Code Text Amendment Number nine and establishing the active centers and corridors design overlay. Finding that all of the applicable review criteria have been met and we also recommend approval of Map Amendment Number 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'i-200080 rezoning these areas of Berkeley and Regis neighborhoods to apply the new DOJ finding again that all applicable review criteria have been met.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you. Christopher, when I saw the 40 the the 40 slides in the deck, I wondered how quick you're going to be able to go. And so great job doing that.'",

Well, tonight, counsel has received one written comment on counsel Bill 157 There are no submitted comments in favor of the application and one submitted comment in opposition of the application. No written comments have been received for counsel Bill 156.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Seen none. Council secretary let the record reflect that all written testimony, both in favor and in opposition of Council Bill 157 have been read by each member of Council and all written testimony will be submitted to the official record of the hearing and this evening on the combined public hearing for Council Bill 156 and 157.'",

I've seen the destruction of much of the retail aspect of Tennyson Street as developers took advantage of mixed use loopholes, specifically by building LA homes and apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The brand's zoning and planning committee has been working to rectify this situation as long as I've been a member, and the effort actually began much earlier. The Zoning and Planning Committee has been working with Councilwoman Sandoval, her staff and city planners since her election in 2019.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Run has kept the neighborhood informed through social media and in-person meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We shut down and affected.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Landowners have been contacted directly by the councilwoman to office. Tonight, I urge council members to approve these text and map amendments to help preserve street activation and the commercial character of the neighborhood. Directly read This neighborhood has been severely impacted by changes in our commercial districts over the last few years, and we believe that instituting this amendment'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and overlay will help preserve the neighborhood's character to the extent possible. So Graham, thanks the council members for their consideration of this matter. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Mr. Killam. And we have another speaker. Rafael Espinosa. And we're going to go ahead and ask former Councilman Espinosa to unmute himself, please.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'You're on this next term. So it's actually taking longer to make the tweaks that the. That the zoning code always anticipated. I do urge. CPD director LG Reddy and others to figure out a way to expedite this process because it really the community effort and the amount of data points and meetings and time and effort that went'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into producing. What seems to be a very rational approach has taken an inordinate amount of of of effort, both by the city and the community. That said, I do want to thank Tom Mobley in the members of the community, specifically CBD staff Andy Dalton, Mr. Dalton, Abe Christopher and Brad for their continuing efforts to shepherd the community'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to get to this point. So thank you for taking the time to consider the matter, and I'm looking forward to hopefully celebrating the adoption once all this COVID stuff is over. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you for joining us, former council member Espinosa, and good to hear from you. All right. That concludes our speakers this evening. On this combined hearing questions from members of Council on Council Bill 156 and or Counsel Bill 157.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Council member, Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I Christopher. Or maybe Councilwoman Sandoval, either one of you, please help me out a little bit with let me go over to the staff report and the presentation on Slide 12, where I talk about the proposed standards for design overlay aid and then where there were more specifics on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On page 22 of the staff report, I'm trying to visualize how these setbacks and minimum heights, etc., will contribute to the outcome that you're that you're desiring for more shop front, townhouse oriented environment. So maybe talk a little bit about increasing the build to range from from 0 to 5 feet to 0 to 10 feet.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What does that do for you as far as encouraging outdoor dining? Talk a little bit about the and the minimum two foot primary setback. Primary street setback in the shopfront form. How does that conflict with the build to it?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's so many measurements in there. I'm just trying to I'm trying to get a picture of what a street that is that has this overlay will eventually look like when these regulations are all adhered to. Christopher or Caroline, if you care.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's what I'm do. Do you want to start? And then I'm happy to. German.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll defer to you, Christopher. Okay. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Perfect. So yeah, that's a that's a great question. So I'll start with let's see why not. I'll start with the with the two foot setback. Part of the reason that we we made that determination is that the current Department of Transportation and Infrastructure, the standard for the amenities are sidewalk along Tennyson.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And most of these areas is actually an eight foot amenity zone and only a five foot sidewalk. That's that that's the minimum standard. So we wanted to make sure that there was, at the very least, potentially an extension of that sidewalk that could be accommodated to allow for a greater intensity of pedestrian movement and activity in this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'particular location. The other thing that actually that helps with is that typically in situations where there is a zero foot setback in the building, as is built right up to the property line, and then what is essentially the back of the sidewalk, if there's ever a table chair and railings permit, which is the permit that you need'",
        "'speaker_6': 'in order to encroach into that public right of way that all goes through. Dottie and CBD doesn't have an opportunity to directly be able to sort of oversee and weigh in and provide comments on those kinds of those kinds of factors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So having that small setback means that now that encroachment covers both a portion of the private property and then extends into the public right of way. So now we've got at least two people, two agencies that have some have some oversight of how that gets how that gets applied, increasing the bill to range from 0 to 5'",
        "'speaker_6': 'feet and going now it would actually be from two feet to ten feet. So we accommodate for that initial setback and then going up to ten feet, basically that allows for a building to be set a little bit further away from the public sidewalk, still meet our standard for having buildings close to, you know, close to the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'street, close to the sidewalk to create that that main street feel from it from a design perspective. But it allows for a lot more flexibility for those outdoor dining or outdoor retail type of experiences that is not encroaching into the public sidewalk.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But we just interrupt. Christopher, I apologize. But say what you're saying is that an outdoor seating area at a cafe could be set back from where the people are traversing the sidewalk, going to walk around, etc.. That's exactly right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I guess that's right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And one other delight that I think I brought up, the 14 foot minimum height for the ground floor, even for residential. Is that in my reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That correctly.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. So the way that that works is that that that standard would apply to projects that that are large enough to have that have that nonresidential requirement. And so the way that that's measured to clarify is that it's a floor to floor height.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's not necessarily the interior volume, the floor to ceiling room. So, you know, there's there's a lot of architectural improvements on the interior of the building where you can have drop ceilings and other things. So in a residential context, that interior volume is probably going to still be more in the 0 to 10 or 11 foot'",
        "'speaker_6': 'range, which is a very comfortable, comfortable height for it for a residential type of of of use. The good thing about having that full 14 feet Florida floor is that then in the future and over time, if those uses are modified and changed, we haven't precluded the fact of for them the opportunity to have a non residential'",
        "'speaker_6': 'or a commercial component in in that ground floor. So if the project was designed with a very limited and short first ground floor height, you potentially create challenges with those uses ever transitioning back into a into a nonresidential type of use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we're trying to account for that. You know, and there's also a lot of research and data out there just in terms of the viability of commercial spaces that generally those taller floor to floor heights and those those, you know, those larger spaces, interior tend to actually lead to people spending more money.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. One last thing, Madam President, if I could. The transparency requirement says eliminate the alternatives. Transparency requirements, except for, I think, art. Let me take a look at it. Except for permanent art to encourage more windows at street level.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Does that apply to the townhouse, the townhome form as well? And in other words, a person's residence on the street would have to have. What are we talking about as far as windows?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, the residential the residential requirement for transparency in the townhouse form and I can double check this, but I believe it's only 40% in the shop front. Form, it's 60%. So it's a much higher standard for building forms that are intended to have a mix of uses.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are there are several other alternatives, transparency alternatives that exist in the code today. And some of them have been used, I'd say, to less success than others. And so that was that was the determination that we wanted to make sure that if there was going to be an alternative to transparency, to a window, we wanted to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'make sure that that was actually something that's contributing back to back to the street. And permanent art is is something that is actually reviewed also by Denver arts and venues to determine if it is actually a work of public art.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that's, again, sort of gives that an extra layer of quality.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Mm hmm. Thank you. Thank you very much, Christopher and Madam President, all have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Torrance. Thank you so much. I'm looking at some of the early slides that you have, obviously. Christopher Councilwoman, we've talked about this being considered for Santa Fe by some of the community there for for that corridor.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now it's being applied to Mex and S and there's language in the in the slides about its use generally four stories, 2 to 5 stories. But as a as a as an overlay, can it be applied to any district more beyond X 2 to 5 or more?'",
        "'speaker_0': '2 to 5.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes, it could be. It's written to apply to really all of our ah mixed use districts within the Denver zoning code. So that could be a, we have our districts the residential mixed use then we have and we have mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is not specific to height, so it could be applied to an eight storey district. I would say the only component about the overlay that does have a reference back to height is that through this process we're also looking at potentially or we've had other neighborhood stakeholders approach us in two story districts and there are some two'",
        "'speaker_6': 'storey districts actually that are being proposed for the rezoning and District one. And there's been a lot of concerns or questions raised about the viability of providing nonresidential uses in a two story project. Once you get up to three stories, five stories, it's a lot easier to financially make that work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But in a two story district, it is difficult. So in the overlay, the nonresidential use standard. So that standard that would require nonresidential uses of the ground floor does not apply to two storey districts. It would have to be a three storey or above.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then the other the only other question that I have is if adopted this evening, projects in queue, who becomes affected by these versus projects that maybe have not applied yet for the permits to construct? Kind of what's the what's the bright line?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. Yeah. That goes back to what we call the effective date and then the applicability of the of the zoning code change. So in this case, and really what the what the default is for really any zoning code amendment is that it becomes effective as of the date of that of the hearing and of the adoption, in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that it is applicable to essentially all projects that have yet to be approved. That is that was determined to be the case here. We had a lot of conversations with Councilmember Sandoval and some of the neighborhood advocates as well, and actually reviewed a lot of the projects that were in that are in the process of the permit'",
        "'speaker_6': 'review. And there were there were some examples that raised a lot of concerns that they were not going to be consistent with the intent of the overlay. And and really then, you know, the intention of the neighborhood for these corridors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so Councilmember Sandoval made the determination that this zoning code change should be effective immediately and should apply to all projects that are still that are still under review. And so essentially, anything that has not received approval, these were these would retroactively apply.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Christopher. Thank you, Councilwoman. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Christopher and Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sandoval, thank you so much for working on this. I'm really, really impressed. I'm just going to ask a question publicly that I've asked both of you in private. We had a couple of people reach out to us who were unhappy that they were sort of caught in the middle of this, that they were already engaged in some'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sort of financial transaction, and they didn't know about this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I've talked to both.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Of you about it a lot. And so thank you very much. But I just thought I'd give you an opportunity to talk a little bit more about all of your outreach. I know you had a fight about it in the presentation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then Councilman Sandoval, specifically, I know you said that all of the property owners were aware of it and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That if there were parties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That weren't aware of it, it was perhaps because the property owner had not revealed that. So if you could just publicly comment on some of those things, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Yes, sure. Thank you for the question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Outreach is essential in these type of projects of the utmost importance. So when we created the town hall notification, I went to the assessor's office in January of 2020 and I asked our assessor to in all of the areas that are mapped, so not the text of the amendment, but the mapped areas of the amendment, which is'",
        "'speaker_3': 'the second bill on reading to send me every property owner on the Denver Assessor's list. So I got that. We got those property records and we mailed them a flier in by U.S. mail notifying them about this survey that my Naomi and my office put together, and about two upcoming town halls that we held at Skinner Middle'",
        "'speaker_3': 'School. So we sent that out the US mail that my office paid for, and then we went back through and we fired. Because a lot of times what I've learned in roads, especially in retail areas and residential, not everybody who not all property owners live on site, but it's important that tenants know about it as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we went back through and fired all of the properties before the town halls happened. And unfortunately, our last town hall took place, I want to say March 12th or March 11th. And the city did get shut down with COVID on March 13th.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So during that transition time, when the city was shut down and we were all virtual and trying to figure things out, we Naomi and I compiled a list of property owners that we didn't think we heard from. And I individually researched our houses to court people to make sure that they were aware of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And any time that we saw something come through a transaction through business then or any other, because properties do have transactions during this time. I personally reached out to all new property owners, but within this amount of time to make sure that they knew about the overlay and we gave them the summation of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And to date, I hadn't heard anything except for right before a planning board. And this past year did I hear from two property owners that they were aware. And for the record, they're not property owners. One of them is under contract, and the woman who lives in the home said she was not aware of it, which there's'",
        "'speaker_3': 'been signs and several notifications that have come through. So I hope that answers your question. And then the other slide, once it was an active application, community planning and development sent one mailer out and by accident they forgot to include something, which is why these two tax amendments are here on the same evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they got a second mailer. So not only did they get one mailer, they got two mailers notifying them about planning board. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Black, for the question and Councilmember Sandoval for the answer. And seen no other hands raise. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 156 and or Council Bill 157.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Well, working for Councilman Espinosa, the community came together with a lot of different concerns regarding Tennyson and the transformation and something the quarter was changing into, something different than they had envisioned while working on Blueprint Denver 2020 or 2002 and the 2010 zoning code update, many residents of the Berkeley Regis community were task'",
        "'speaker_3': 'force members who volunteered their expertize and time to the zoning code. Update the zoning 2010 update and as we see development occurred along along the corridor, new forms. We're out of context and we're taking cues from the surrounding neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We would not be here today if it weren't for numerous advocates in the neighborhood who spent years and hours and dedicated to this overlay. So in 2010, the zoning code established Main Street and mixed use zoning along Tennyson, which historically had been one of our streetcar nodes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we have some areas of Denver where commercial is embedded within a residential neighborhood. So many corridors like Tennyson, like Law got their life from having mixed use, residential mixed use among the residential neighborhoods. These historic areas show a pattern of small acts and pedestrian friendly design suitable for strolling to and from street car shops.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The 2010 zoning code reflected the Berkeley community's desire to maintain and enhance these commercial corridors while also making room for new residential density that would support businesses. Unfortunately, long standing main streets like Tennyson have experienced a loss of commercial space new due to new developments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At a time when we are facing such a crisis and housing needs in our city, it is easy to forget about the lack of spaces for small businesses when we desperately need new housing. We also need places to work, shop and everything else to create a vibrant, walkable, compact city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Our businesses are suffering immensely right now, and not just from COVID, but from an entire system of land use and other forces. These businesses are what make our neighborhood such a great place to live and deserve to be protected.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The loss of tenants in character is incredibly painful. Yet with so many wonderful, creaky spaces are gone, there is much to preserve on Tennyson and throughout Berkeley Regis and as I keep in mind, planning for the next seven generations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am also heartened to know that this design overlay can help preserve the commercial nature of historic Main Streets throughout Denver. I would like to end by thanking everybody who spent years seeking my predecessor, Councilman Espinosa, for his steadfast leadership who I call often and ask for advice.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For Naomi in my office, for who goes above and beyond to do community outreach, attend late night meetings. I'd like to thank Christopher for attending numerous meetings in the evening and his ability to go back and forth with design efforts with Naomi and I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It was rewarding and it was a great experience the whole time and everyone else at KPD. And I'd also like to thank my staff, Gina and Naomi. A lot of times we go, We can't do this work without our staff.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I'll just say that to Gina. Naomi, many thank you all for supporting me and this crazy idea of moving forward, all these overlays during the time of COVID. And with that, it would be an honor if I were able to get all of your vote tonight in support of something that my community has desperately been wanting for'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Extremely.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Important pair of measures are embedded. Commercial districts are such a have such a rich history and such such an important part of our community fabric to lose them to to add a few more housing units just I don't think would be the trade off we're looking for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm really excited to support this and I hope to see it implemented further around the town. So thank you. Thanks a lot, Christopher. Thanks for the presentation and for your hard work.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just want to piggyback on what Councilman Cashman said and congratulate Councilwoman Sandoval for addressing something that even before I got on council six years ago, I think had been a source of a lot of anxiety among residents of Denver, fearful of losing what is Denver?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This allows growth, but it allows it to occur in a way that is complementary and absorbs that growth in a way that maintains the look and feel of neighborhoods. And particularly up on in northwest Denver, where I don't spend a whole lot of time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I have been up there. I was up there with Councilman Espinosa when he was in office, taking a look at what he was describing, exactly what was needed here. And so I just wanted to congratulate Councilman Sandoval for following through on that and seeing it come to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'll be happy to support it. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. And it looks like Councilman Cashman, we have you back up in the queue. But if it's okay, we'd like to go to Councilmember Ortega since you've been up. All right. Thank you, sir. Councilmember Ortega.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'But I also wanted to just mention quickly another subject that Councilman Espinosa was very interested in, that I hope we can move further down the road is the appropriate use of design review in our commercial projects. I'd seen in my own district some examples that they're just doggone shame to just, you know, you don't need to keep'",
        "'speaker_5': 'everything exactly the same. But I think it's important.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman, and appreciate that, Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm impressed. Just a quick note. I should have made mention of this that I found it ironic. Councilwoman Sandoval, you might want to look into this. Why? The Regis neighborhood had a high rate of residents without a college degree.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think you need to ask the Jesuits what's going on up there. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I think we just heard a plug for some scholarships for the neighborhood out there. Well, I'll go ahead and chime in here. Last seen no more hands raised.

And it was great to hear a little bit from former Councilman Espinosa as well. And so thank you for all of the work by yourself and your council office and Christopher as well.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so appreciate that and I will be happy to support both Council Bill 156 and 157 this evening and seeing no other hands raised. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 156 and 157.'",

So we got that the combined public hearing for Council Bill 158 and Council Bill 159 is open. Speakers may offer comments on either or both items and may we go ahead and have a staff report.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we have Brad Johnson with us this evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. We. My screen shoot here. Seeing that. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You got it, Brad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay, thank you. One more thing. You. All right. So Brad Johnson, senior city planner and urban designer with CBD. I'm here to talk to you about Tech's amendment number ten to create a bungalow conservation overlay or scope six and the MAP Amendment 2020 899 to apply that conservation overlay in the Harkness cites portion of the Berkeley neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_4': '. It's. Okay. This is sponsored by a councilwoman, Amanda Sandoval, of course. And the big idea here is to ensure and modify the zoning design standards in this area to ensure that development that occurs out here into the future is more compatible visually with the existing character of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So to the text amendment, we would actually create a bungalow conservation overlay C of six. We would make some supportive associated small amendments in articles 11 and 13, and then we'd do some minor kind of cleanup work to conservation overlay CO four, which is the Potter Highlands land just for clarity and consistency, nothing substantive there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then again, a map amendment, tourism properties in harness heights from us, you see. And us you see. One to us you see z06 six and us you see 106. So we're in Council District one in the Berkeley neighborhood, Zoomin, just west of federal so so areas generally bounded by federal low 44th and 41st.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There is this one hole in the middle of the rezoning area, which is pad which is not proposed to be was the overlay would not be applied to. So I'll talk about the text to amendment first. So very in 2010 when the zoning code was was updated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, when you're doing a zoning code update of that scale in a city the size of Denver, you have to come up with some manageable number of zoning classifications to apply to the to the thousands of acres of single unit residential areas around the city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in doing so, you have to, to some degree, take a sort of a broader approach while still trying to be mindful of context sensitivity. And so they did do that. And our zone districts are set up to be context sensitive when it comes to predominant lots sizes, building coverages, the location of garages and things of that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'nature and driveways and such. But they knew the authors of the zoning code at that time, and maybe many of you that worked on it, and those in the community knew that they weren't going to get it all right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so they they saw that ahead of time. And they put in place this mechanism, which is a conservation overlay, which allows council members, community members, the city, to to come in and essentially write custom zoning for specific areas to to right size that zoning to the character of a specific neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'How it works is that the conservation overlay overlays or sits on top of the underlying zoning regulations, those baseline regulations stay in place and new or modified standards are also put in place through the conservation overlay where there's any difference between the two.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The conservation overlay standards are those that apply. And then as you heard in the last presentation, the conservation overlay cannot modify permitted uses in the underlying districts. This would be the sixth conservation overlay in the city. So in ten years, really not that many have come online.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. So this bring us to a total of six. Just to quickly mention and I'll come back to this in more detail, but we do have a very specific and clear support from Blueprint Denver for the use of conservation overlays to enhance and retain the existing character neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm trying to give you a feel for what this neighborhood is like. If you go and walk this neighborhood and you look around and try to try to take it all in, I think mostly what you're going to see is you're going to see a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the most part, you're going to see one story sort of bungalow as you would think. A bungalow neighbor, a bungalow, a building forms. You're going to see a mixing of two story forms as well. Throughout the neighborhood, buildings typically have pitched roofs, pretty modest footprint sizes and home sizes overall.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As you look down the street, kind of taking in the streetscape, you'll see this sort of rhythm of traditional front porches that predict project from that front facade of the building. You also see that the first story or that street level story is typically raised after the grade a bit.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then here you'll see pretty generous side setbacks compared to some of our other neighborhoods in Denver. And then something really unique here in Harkness Heights is that you'll you'll know it. And then the data sort of backs this up, is that the setbacks from the South Side property line are typically more generous than those from the'",
        "'speaker_4': '. So as a council district in the neighborhood came together and started thinking about this tool and the appropriateness of it for hurting as high as they want to first understand what could be built under the existing baseline regulations.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what you're looking at here is a graphic that indicates in the middle, sort of a typical bungalow house that you'd see in Harkness Heights, and then on the left and right, a couple of different styles of buildings that maxed out what you could do under the existing zoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so through those types of exercises, they identified a range of compatibility concerns that they wanted to address, which are summarized here in the slide. And they sort of landed on a series of key objectives to go into the development of this overlay, one, to ensure the development is compatible in scale and massing with the existing character'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of the neighborhood to ensure that the siting of buildings in this neighborhood reflect prevailing side set back patterns, as I just spoke about, to ensure that there is a maintenance of that, that a rhythm of one storey elements in this case projecting front porches and to mitigate potential impacts of upper level outdoor spaces on adjacent property within'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the adjacent properties. And within the context of those overlay objectives, they, the neighborhood and council also wanted to maintain a certain degree of design flexibility to allow for contemporary design or different materials maybe that were were typically or traditionally used in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So really focusing on form and not details like style and materials. So when I walked through some of the, the through all the conservation overlay elements themselves. So if adopted, this conservation overlay would reduce building height both in feet and in stories, and it would do so more significantly in as it pertains to feet for structures with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'what's called a low slope roof and as defined in the code that has to do with the pitch of the roofs. If you see the graphics over here, anything that's at three, 12, 3 to 12 pitch or less is considered a low slope roof, but for all intents and purposes is basically a flat or almost flat roof'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And so that's a move to try to allow flat roof forms and almost flat roof forms that weren't really traditional to this neighborhood. But if if constructed, a certain height can still be compatible with the existing character. The overlay would put in place upper maximum or excuse me, minimum and maximum height for the upper surface of that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'street level floor of 12 inch and 36 inch respectively, to ensure that development in the area is scaled in terms of its first floor to fall within the range of what's typically seen in the neighborhood. The overlay would incrementally constrict the boat plane, which is a zoning code word, which essentially means the building envelope or volume within'",
        "'speaker_4': 'which a building can be built. Under the zoning code, some some some small tweak there to bring the scale and masking down a bit. It would put in place gross floor area maximums for the primary structure of 3000 square feet and allow additional flexibility for larger lots.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to note here that again, this only applies to primary structure and it also only applies to above grade floor area. So if you have basement space or something like that, it wouldn't count against this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh. The overlay would also put in place what's called a lower slope, upper storey step. And what that says is that if you have a portion of a building that has a low slope roof greater than 15 feet, that that portion of the building above 15 feet must be set back from the primary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The lower portion of the primary street facing facade, a minimum of ten feet. I talked about citing the overlay for most lots out here would increase the minimum interior side setbacks incrementally and it would also require this setback to be staggered.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, again, a larger setback from the south sides on line than that from the north. The conservation overlay would require front porches be provided in development and that those front porches meet specified design criteria. And it would the overlay would prohibit rooftop and or second story decks that are on or above the second story or that are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'projecting from the building above the street level. You know, talk about the map amendment. Existing zoning, as I mentioned, was as you as you see and you as you see one, there's this 1c1 property in there that zoning was approved for that, I think, back in February.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's relatively new. And then you also see the zoning in the surrounding context. This map shows existing land uses in the rezoning area and then first round in the immediate context. Some more pictures of existing build, form and scale both within the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then some of those uses and forms an immediate context. The public outreach for this project was really amazing, both on behalf of her, as done by Councilwoman Sandoval and led by her and Councilman Espinosa before her time in office.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I would also say that the work by the residents of this neighborhood themselves and helping with the outreach was also nothing short of amazing and very, very rigorous. This display certainly doesn't do it justice. But I did want to highlight some of the some of the key outreach elements that were undertaken here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm in terms of public comment, we got a letter of support from the Heritage Sites Neighborhood Association, R.A. And we got as of the publishing in the staff report, I had received 25 letters of support and three in opposition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think you have received a couple more letters of support since the publishing and the staff report. To my knowledge, the letters of support should be up to 27 at this point, although maybe you may have received others that I'm not aware of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Most of the letters in support are are in support of this because it is again, maintaining the character of the neighborhood as an overlay is intended to do. Some of the letters in opposition were generally in opposition to additional regulation, but just at an overall level, not a lot of specificity about specific points, the overlay that they'",
        "'speaker_4': 'were in opposition to. We followed the process for a text map amendment as as we were required. And that brought us here to the city council public hearing. For the review criteria, we have to look at both the specialized review criteria for a conservation overlay and also the typical legislative texts and map amendment review criteria.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we'll start with the conservation overlay. So what the zoning code says is that the area to which a conservation overlay is applied shall have one of the following distinctive building features or distinctive siting features. So I went over those already in the previous portion of the slide show.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But suffice to say, staff certainly found that this overlay and and the area needs not just one but both of these criteria. So now I'll move into the adopted plans. The text and map amendment mean any number of of policies and can't plan 2043 of the ones that we found to be most relevant we've shown here for'",
        "'speaker_4': 'your reference. Moon to blueprint Denver. The future neighborhood context is urban, calling for residential areas, a single unit and two unit. This text and map amendment would not change the permitted uses in the area, so we're just simply maintaining consistency with your neighborhood context.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Feature place type is low residential calling for predominantly single and two unit uses. Again, since the text and map amendment wouldn't change, the permitted uses of this action would just maintain consistency with a blueprint. Denver feature place type features, street types or combination of residential street types.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Although most of the streets in the rezoning area are actually local on designated streets. But for those that are designated, what they call square is primarily primarily residential uses too. So but those streets and that those used to be modestly stepped back are sorry have modest front setbacks that would vary by neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this case, this text and map amendment wouldn't change anything about the allowed uses or modify the front setbacks. Therefore it would just maintain consistent and see with future street types. And then growth area strategy. This is designated as all areas, all other areas of the city, meaning it's meant to accommodate incremental change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Over time, the tax amendment will continue to allow that incremental growth over time. So we maintain consistency with the future growth strategy. Excuse me. Couple other policies to point out. Again, the one I showed you earlier where Blueprint Denver specifically encourages to use conservation overlays in areas where there is a goal to retain the unique character of'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a neighborhood. And then also, there is a clear policy that supports this type of large scale legislative rezoning and text amendment, provided that there is a robust outreach. And certainly this text map would be consistent with both of these.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As a large Texan map amendment, we need to do our equity impacts analysis. And so if you look at access to opportunity, this area is scored as having average access. The TEX Amendment and MAP amendment would not change the uses that are permitted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So wouldn't and would also not increase transit service or result in any specific development project. Therefore, it's likely to have no impact on access to opportunity. Involuntary displacement is area scored as not vulnerable. The text ma'am amendment. Excuse me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The text and map amendment would not change the permitted use as out here or increase the development potential in terms of the number of units that are allowed on a lot and therefore is likely to have no impact on involuntary displacement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In terms of housing diversity, the areas scored as having less diversity. For most measures, we think that for some of the same reasons I've been mentioning that that that the tungsten map and women are likely to have no impact on most of those measures.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'However, you look at home size diversity, which is one of the measures that may have some minor impact on that, and that it does place limitations on square footage which would result in smaller homes if new homes were to come along and may also have an effect of reducing the likeliness that a home would be demolished and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'replaced with a very large house because of the delta between what's on the ground and what can be built would be somewhat reduced here. Then for jobs, diversity, the the the area within the rezoning area that sort of made it on the board here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Half of the area didn't get it make it make the cut in terms of this measure at all. But the Western portion did and that block group scored is having more retail. And again, since this text and map amendment wouldn't change, the permitted use was like introducing other nonresidential uses than than what the underlying zoning already allows'",
        "'speaker_4': '. It's likely to have no impact on jobs diversity. We also found that this rezoning would result in uniformity of district regulations, and there would also further public health, safety and welfare of the community, both by implementing adopted plans, but also maintaining this very walkable, pedestrian friendly area into the future.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so with that, CPD recommends approval of Denver Zoning Code Text Amendment Number ten, establishing bungalow conservation overlay CO six and associated amendments finding that the applicable review criteria have been met. And secondly, staff recommends approval of MAP Amendment 2020 999 rezoning USAC and USAC one zoned properties in the rezoning area to apply the SEAL six overlay'",

There are four submitted comments in favor of the application and no submitted comment in opposition of the application.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate what you've done with the active transportation overlay and I do recognize the value of design elements here. But but I, but I sincerely worry that we have sort of gone too far with some of this language and restricted out some types of forms that would generally promote some of the city's goals around affordability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And particularly, we have and we also have some elements in here that are inconsistent with the reality of the neighborhood as it stands today, one of which is about the front porches. The guidelines say that a front porch must exist and cannot a lot more than exterior wall.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This despite the fact that many of the original homes that are in this neighborhood right now are in violation of this rule. Wraparound porches are really common porches facing a driveway, in some cases, porches facing a side of a building.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is particularly true for the multi-family, the currently multi-unit spaces, and will restrict further development that makes multi-unit spaces attractive. My understanding from a discussion with a planner was this was not the intention. This did not intend to forbid wraparound.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This was a mistake. But when I raised this feedback was told it was too late to make any changes because it had already gone, had been submitted, dilutive in some way. So we're passing something that doesn't actually meet the intent of of what the planners had designed.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'm also noting that there is this sort of apparently arbitrary and arbitrarily large figure of 120 square feet for front porches currently. Again, 100% of the multi-unit properties between 41st and 42nd are in violation of that. Their board sizes are too small.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I did learn that this square footage came from a meeting from neighborhood submitted measurements, neighbors who wanted to submit measurements. I'm assuming that folks with large, large porches are the one that submitted measurements to create an average, because looking around the neighborhood, most of the homes in the neighborhood right now violate this overlay criteria because their'",
        "'speaker_1': 'porches are too small. So in both of these cases, we were creating standards that don't actually match the reality. What we see today and again, I'm concerned. Put together a standard that encourages the creation of the most expensive housing type.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Large single family bungalows with excessively large porches and space, etc. and will discourage affordable development here. Otherwise. I think that's that that's about it. I'm a little worried that there's a few stated intense here. Affordability is not one of them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And we we are doing things that may damage that city goal. And I'm concerned we haven't addressed that here. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Jonathan. And Mr. Mobley, if we're not able to get you into the queue here, we see you, but you might need to log out and log back in. And our central staff will be looking for you in the attendees.'",

In July of 2019, counsel Amanda Sandoval and her staff took over the continuation of the overlay process from Counsel Espinosa. She brought on board Naomi Grundfest, who was invaluable resource in enhancing our overlay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we were able to bring it back to the entire neighborhood for their review in March of 2020. Councilwoman Sandoval invited all property owners to two different town halls where she discussed herself, as well as her staff and the CDC representatives and our zoning chair after these two meetings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Every property owner was invited to share their thoughts and opinions on every component of this overlay via an online survey. If anyone had difficulty, we contacted them by phone or socially distanced them in person and helped them fill out the recent survey.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Over 80% supported the overall overall overall overlay and shared comments on the specific elements. The task force, along with CBT and Amanda's staff, made adjustments to the sentiment of community. It was then turned over to CBT staff for formal drafting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Throughout this time, we kept the neighborhood abreast of the situation. As plans were finalized. We posted these on our web page as well and we emailed the hearing notifications to our residents as we see them.

        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. A sincere thank you to each one of you for taking the time to be present at this hearing. A special thanks to the city councilman, especially Amanda Sandoval, for sponsoring sponsoring this overlay and also Brad and Amy for their hard work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I truly appreciate the efforts to help ensure this changing city maintains much of what makes it unique. I am asking for your wholehearted support for zoning change 20 10158 and five nine. I am a Colorado native with a deep love for this state in all of its beauty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My husband and I moved to Harkness Heights in July of 2019. We looked at around 120 homes before deciding on our 1911 craftsman charmer. As a realtor in Colorado for 14 years. We were able to move quickly on our dream home.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A large part of the appeal to this home was the neighborhood full of charm, mature landscaping, beautifully maintained older homes with few scrapes. This is what we wanted a neighborhood where owners were preserving the character and not tearing it down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As a member of the younger generation living in Harkness Heights. The charm of the bungalows that make up the streets in this area is something I want to be a part of keeping and not changing. We are one of the 20 larger lots in the area and there was no way I would ever knock down our home'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to build a larger home with less land. In fact, I ripped up over 800 square feet of sod and now grow a vegetable garden. Although the time I have lived here has been shorter than most, the love for the area neighbors and charm runs deeply in my veins.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'After reading through the 200 plus survey responses, there were two concerns a few residents had. One is regarding values, and the other is property rights. As a realtor, I wanted to see if the concerns about an overlay negatively affecting value was true.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I heard the data from the MLS and this is what I found. I use the Potter Highlands overlay boundary for this data. It went into effect in November 2015. I used sold home values in this area and then compared it to the entire metro area for the same time period.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'What I found where the values went up 46% in the metro area over the last five and a half years. The value increase in Potter Highlands was 43%, just in line with the Metro average. These numbers are very few any cause for concern with overlays negatively affecting value.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The other concern some had on the survey was about property rights. No matter when you purchased your home, you bought a home that had some type of limitation on what could be built or changed. Billing constraints have been a part of the city since 1925.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So over the last 95 years, there have been limits. This overlay is seeking to refine those limits to ensure this neighborhood keeps the energy, esthetics and character it has maintained for over a century. As the results from the survey indicated, the large majority of residents are in favor of this overlay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With over 80% of the respondents in support. This overlay is also in line with Denver's comprehensive 2040 plan. Striving to celebrate architecture, keeping smaller, more affordable homes, and maintaining the character and vibrancy in this area. I kindly ask for your support to vote in favor of this overlay to preserve the charm of Harkness Heights.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your time, and I appreciate having the opportunity to speak on behalf of our wonderful neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Well, thank you, Amber, and to all of our speakers this evening. And that concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 158 and or Council Bill 159. And we've got a couple of members up in the queue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember CdeBaca, your first.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Just wanted to ask Brad a little bit about.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The list of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Building features or site features that qualify under the criteria. I'm really excited.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And want to thank Councilwoman Sandoval for her work on this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm interested in it for some parts of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My district, but also a little bit worried.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Because it seems like the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Features might be associated with people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who might have had more.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Money when they were constructing their homes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so I want to know, like, what are the things that could count as the building features or the siting features?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I appreciate that question. I'm trying to bring up the section so I can give you a very clear answer, but I would while I try to find that, I'll just say that it's typically about the form of the buildings in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so a typical process would be to do an analysis of a certain area to determine, you know, what the data and what's actually on the ground is telling us. It could be roof form, it could be the presence of porches, it could be the siting of the building, it could be materials, it could be a lot'",
        "'speaker_4': 'of different things. And so the key is that it focuses on sort of the physical form of of both building and siting features. So I think there's a quite a bit of flexibility actually in terms of of. Well, what can be on the table for what constitutes what's appropriate for a conservation overlay?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it might be completely different in one area versus another, and a neighborhood might have a different view about what compatibility means in one area versus another.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is the process for inferred catalyzing? Is there a decision involved?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'd like to chime in on your first question. So there's an important piece of documentary. It's called Discover Denver. So Discover Denver has done it works with historic Denver and community planning and development. And they did an analysis of this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to say that this analysis came out in 2015, and it talks about some of the characteristics that you mention. And so that is how we got a lot of the report done, is if you go into them, discover Denver, they've done some of Globeville, various ones here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Jefferson Park mine is called the 1920s, small, lot, small homes. And so actually it was these homes were not associated with people who had more money. It was actually a group of architects who founded an association in 1914 to come up with homes so families could move into them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But they were it was nationwide and they were constructed so that they could be affordable for families moving into this area. So I can share that with you. But I just wanted you to know that there's this amazing resource out there that started this work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I found that when I was working for Councilwoman Monteiro to help figure out where it should go next. And we pointed it, directed it to Global in Swansea because of the gentrification and change in the built environment.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Brad.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you catch.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The other.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The other question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About how how many people you need or how many blocks you need to catalyze this process? And is there like a petition involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Where homeowners have to approve it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, there's no formal homeowner approval. I think typically the council district representative is the one that sort of leads the process. So of course, you could talk to to Councilwoman Sandoval and she could tell you about her experience in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have developed some basic guides in CPD that we could provide you just for what the typical process might be to develop a conservation overlay. But again, this is sort of just guidance, understanding that every every case is different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And and there's no hard and fast rule about, you know, you need this many votes, etc., etc.. What we would be looking for to make a recommendation for a conservation overlay and CPD, of course, would be that there was adequate outreach, that it seemed like there was a consensus that this was in a direction that people that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'own property in the neighborhood wanted to go. But it's not like, you know, must be 60% or anything hard and fast like that. And if I can, just to your other question, I found that piece of of code says to apply a conservation overlay to the district should contain distinctive building features such as a period such as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'period of construction style, size, scale, detailing, mass color and material or the design or distinctive site planning and natural features such as light cladding, building, light coverage, street layout, setbacks, alleyways, sidewalks, creek beds, parks and gardens. So I mean, I just read that to give you a sense of how how broad and flexible this tool is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. Thank you so much. You'll be here for me. That's it for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Up next, Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President I have a question about Slide 15, the scale and massing, specifically the upper surface of the floor on street level. I, I understand there was a bit of a conversation in your, in your process about the, you know, ensuring that there on grade was not allowed and that that meant the minimum surface was'",
        "'speaker_1': 'between 12 and 36 inches. Specifically with regards to the disability community. And actually, I want to thank Councilmember Sandoval and your office for for providing this again today. So I just I it sounds like you had a rich engagement.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You had some conversation about that. So. So, Mr. Johnson, perhaps you can you can talk about that, that engagement process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, happy to start. And Councilman Sandoval and or Naomi may want to jump in after. So, yeah, we struggle with this one a little bit. On the one hand, this is such a character defining element in the neighborhood, right?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, when you think of a bungalow form, that's what you think of. The porch is like a little bit a and you're sort of hanging out in the porch above the street level. Right. And so the the importance of that physical characteristics of the neighborhood was was clear from the beginning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'On the other hand, we did want to be mindful of accessibility issues. So we did a couple of different things. So we we did ultimately decide in coordination with the council district in the neighborhood to keep the rule about, you know, minimum 12, maximum and 36 inch for that first floor and place.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we did a couple of other things to build in a little bit more flexibility. So first thing we did was we. So in the existing code, in the baseline regulations, you are allowed to to have an ADA around that that encroaches into the setback area for an existing building only and only if you exacerbated all other'",
        "'speaker_4': 'options beyond the front set back first. So the first thing we did with this overlay was we said, forget about that, we're making this new rules, so let's build in more flexibility. So we said no, in this overlay, you you can encroach into any set back regardless of whether it was your best or third or second option'",
        "'speaker_4': 'or whatever. So you can do that period. And we also made it so that you could do that for an existing or a new building. The other thing we did was we made that rule so that it only applied to the front 40% of the zone lot depth.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's really just the front part of the house. So that would allow perhaps a little bit more flexibility, you know, in the rear portion of the lot or even the middle portion of a lot to gain that access.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And it is. Oh, sorry. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. So just wanted you to know that as soon as this got brought up about ADA Access, we immediately reached out to the Division of Disability Rights for in Denver and talked to Dr. Russo, Aisha, and talked to her about concerns or different issues that we had heard.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so we vetted this several different times in several different ways. So I know exactly what you're talking about. And ultimately, what is a character defining feature in Harkness Heights also is to have a higher ceiling so that people can have basements because we have the Denver Hill and the topography so strange and the water table has'",
        "'speaker_3': 'gone up a lot of times is people aren't having as big basements. And in northwest Denver, especially in Harkness Heights, you can actually have some apartments, like you can have an attached accessory dwelling unit basement or accessory ground unit in these units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that was a character defining feature that we found in our analysis that we did do extensive outreach to the Office of Disability Rights. And if needed, you can always go to the VOA to buy right to bypass the standard of the overlay if needed, because it is in the church itself.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a hardship.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you for your your thoughts and context. And we were all and actually so one other question this actually does it apply to it applies to new construction, but also existing construction is is that right? So the whole construction.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That really changes in the FDA requirements. And you said 40%, and I think I heard you say that that also can apply to existing dwellings, that they also have additional flexibility should they want to make accessibility improvements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's correct. And that's allowed in the baseline current.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Hines, Councilwoman Sandoval, we have you up.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. I just would like to call up one of our speakers, former Councilman Espinosa. He worked on a lot of the part that Councilman Hines is talking about. So I just wanted to bring him up to see if he has any clarifying thoughts or any anything else that he can add to the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Sounds good. We've got him moved up into the queue. And I have to say, a couple of these slides I think I've seen in the past, not just in the recent committee, but from way back when, when we were talking about the scale and massing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So welcome back, former Councilman Espinosa. And if you wanted to address the councilman's question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you for the opportunity again. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The yeah. So as a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At the time this started, I was a licensed architect and I just want to be very clear that federal ADA does not apply to privately owned homes. It is only for public facilities. And so the right of way, you know, public buildings and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this was something we were super cognizant of. But at the same time, if you lose, if you know the topography of this neighborhood, the only way to to access a new construction home would be to basically to demolish the historic Denver Hill and build a form that is completely antithetical to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So what we were pursuing was a conservation overlay, which is a very specific tool in the Denver zoning code toolbox, not unlike, say, the Cris, the park conservation overlay that we approved in prior council. So it's, it's, it's addressing unique features to this specific community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And among them is the elevated ground floor level. That being said, being mindful of the topography changes the alleyways most of most, if not all the blocks are accessible through alleys. And so if you have the resources to build a new construction project and excavate out the hill and bring your building down, you probably would have the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'resources as an architect. It would be far simpler to to enter level from from your an accessible garage into an accessible home. And the rest of the tools and rules in the overlay district do allow for a fully accessible unit to be built.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the it's the front porch access. That would be a challenge, but it would be a challenge nonetheless, mostly because of topography. So it is something we were mindful of. But again, ADA itself, federal ADA rules do not apply to single family homes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That are built with private dollars, I should say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Former Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Sandoval, did you have any other questions for the councilman? All right. Well, might just keep you up here, because I see Councilman Hines has has raised his hand again. And so we're going to go ahead and go to Councilmember Ortega and get her question asked, and then we'll go back'",
        "'speaker_0': 'to you, Councilman Hines. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask a question about the the size of the porches. One of the speakers raised the question about the fact that some of the porches are actually smaller than what the language calls for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And clearly, we're not saying that they have to go build a larger porch. This, I'm assuming, applies to any new construction that would happen in the neighborhood that would require a larger porch. So can either Mr. Johnson or Councilman Sandoval just clarify that that point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. I'm happy to take this and grab a minute by myself. Feel free to come. So when the speaker Jonathan from my facts met with my staff, Naomi, three things were inaccurately portrayed in those comments. It specifically this overlay specifically made it clear which is Naomi made it clear that the wrap around purchase in no way are'",
        "'speaker_3': 'prohibited. We wouldn't want to create anything that's not prohibited now and that the standards are merely their minimums. So it's just a minimum standard to have a porch and you can go above that minimum as much as you would like to, and you can have a wraparound porch if that's something that you would like to.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'About the comment above the duplex form having side porches. There are seven duplexes in Harkness Heights and only two of them have had entries on the side and that's due big to the corner. It's a corner unit and they're in trees on the side.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the other duplex has its newly built and it's not an original building. And so the data on the porch was collected not not by name, not by the neighborhoods it would come from. And Espinosa hired Helena architecture from from Boulder, and they did all the data collecting and all of the information gathering.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It wasn't just neighbors putting together information. It was it was I wouldn't do that. It was very meticulous and very thoughtful. And then Naomi vetted it and vetted it and vetted it time and time again. So I hope that answers your questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, that's very helpful. I'm trying to understand they know there was some comparison to the Outer Highlands conservation overlay in Potter. Highlands is also a historic district and I'm just curious why overlay versus historic districts? For this area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the Potter Highland overlay, that's a two unit zoning. So it's different zoning and that was for the infill development that was not they didn't feel like was taking cues from the Potter Highland Design Review Board that is there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that one was for infill development and it was the Harkness Heights Association voted prior to us getting involved. And they decided that they didn't want to do a historic district. They wanted to pursue the conservation overlay. And that was when Tom Mabrey talked about the conversation with historic Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was when they decided that they didn't want to pursue a historic district, that they would rather pursue the conservation overlay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it was the neighborhood that made that decision.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Those are all the questions I have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega and Councilmember Hines, we got you back up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President So I don't remember. ESPINOSA Absolutely not. But but not that he needs aid. Nobody needs affirmation from me. Excuse me. The Honorable Espinosa is absolutely right. It doesn't apply to single family units. And so that's why I mentioned accessibility as opposed to specifically ADA, you know, and I also totally get that, that we'",
        "'speaker_1': 'should retain some of the neighborhood character. I think that if we destroy neighborhood character for I mean, the whole idea of this is to create more neighborhood character, not just, you know, McMansions or whatever. So I, you know, personally, I'm a fan of universal design.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so if I cannot access an entrance the same way as everyone else, then I wouldn't live there. But that that's my personal choice. That's not a choice that we should make as a, you know, as a deliberative body for every every place in the city or in this you know, in this overlay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But but here's an interesting observation. Since my crash, I haven't seen it where my friends live or the people I've dated. I don't know if they keep a clean house or a messy house or they have pictures on their walls or whatever.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and it's I try to create neighborhood. It's been really amazing to have you in in my time on council. A lot of those a lot of those properties have elevators. And it's partly because they know that we're aging as a as a state, we're aging as a society.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and so more and more people will have accessibility concerns. But but I think, you know, something that's interesting to me is being able to visit where friends live. And so. I get the idea of the Denver Hill and I get the idea that that we shouldn't steamroll what is amazing, you know, in in a particular neighborhood'",
        "'speaker_1': 'that makes that character of the neighborhood. I guess you mentioned the early access, though, and that's interesting to me. And I wonder, because I had my hands full with District ten, I didn't know this, you know, this area as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I wondered if the that alley access you mentioned that was agreed. Is that what you're saying, that that's an aspiration or is it generally that the homes in this area are at great? In, Ali.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I love to speak.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, I. I was sort of waiting for Brad to chime in there or counsel one of our. But if you know the answer, Councilman Espinosa, please go ahead and chime in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These homes, you know, built.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In the twenties and stuff and whatnot, they are not they are not without obstacles when entered from the rear, that's for sure. But the I was saying from a technical standpoint on a new construction project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The Delta, the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great difference between the alley and the first floor is is basically the six inches that you would build a foundation that would be the only requirement. Whereas the great difference between that same floor level and the street level is typically well in excess of 30 inches.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's probably closer to 60. But and that's without.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The additional the additional floor level that we're in, that datum that we're.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Establishing. So it is it is just the nature of the nature of the topography, that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A much closer I mean, a much shorter rise.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over a longer run from.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Alley to rear entrance.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Than it is from front entrance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Councilman Hines. I didn't know if Councilman Sandoval wanted to to answer as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you. So, as Rafael mentioned, this is for new construction or for anybody who wants to age in place. And we have a lot of people in this neighborhood who are looking to age in place. And this has been in discussion.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And a lot of the I've lived across the street from this neighborhood. I live on the other side of 44 for almost 20 years now. And aging in place, I think, in Denver is a big conversation. And so we when we were talking about this with the Office of Disability Rights, we did talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's why we brought in the ability for them to go to the. And oftentimes, you will see in this neighborhood, not throughout all northwest Denver, but the topography changes so drastic in this neighborhood, you can start on 44th and go down to 41st in the cities in the Seattle area and probably drop 50 feet, if not'",
        "'speaker_3': 'more. So many times homes as people have had hip replacements or knee replacements, major surgeries. They do end up having bigger garages in the back and they do usually access their homes through the back. I've seen it and they've entered some houses that you bring up great points about the fact that you're not able to go visit'",
        "'speaker_3': 'your friends. And that's something that I have thought about without aging in place for sure.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah. And and I don't mean that. I mean that it needs to be built for me. I'm just thinking as we be personally Christians, but you know, just as we as we do get older as a as a society, I think having a way to to break bread with with your friends or neighbors that helps us with'",
        "'speaker_1': 'community. And so that I with new construction, you know, just be nice to have that that consideration of that if if it's effectively grayed through the alley. I think that that's a reasonable accommodation to use an 80 term.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Again, 88 is not quite but it is a to use the term having that, that ingress and egress maybe not through the front and um, and so, but anyway, that really the main reason why I brought it up is to think, you know, the District one office for, for your fourth art and I say the District one'",
        "'speaker_1': 'office because I know, I know all of us, but knows it was also thinking about it. So and I. But Councilmember Sandoval, thank you for for continuing that that deliberative process. So that's that's what I think you council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Council Member Hines, and thank you, former council member Espinosa for also joining us this evening. And the public hearing is closed. Comments from members of Council on Council Bill 158 and or Council Bill 159.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. When I think about the classic timber brick bungalow, I instantly think of partner sites. I love that type of original neighborhood architecture and my change is constant. It is so important to fight for what you love and what makes Stender distinctive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The rapid rise of out of scale and out of character infill and redevelopment in surrounding Berkeley neighborhood after the 2010 overhaul of the citywide residential zoning code spurred Harkness Heights to action. Not only did this neighborhood come together to get involved, but they have done it in such a thoughtful and thorough way.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Home is where the heart is. And as we've had tough and important conversations. The discussions at the meetings were wide ranging, including the potential effect on property values and demand for homes, and the potential impact on homeowners planning to undertake additions or renovations to their properties.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The task force has work with two objectives in mind to encourage preservation or partial preservation of existing homes instead of scrapes, and to have new buildings enhance the character of the neighborhood. The result of these community conversations is a strong proposal that balances the need for change and growth with the with the preserving with preserving what the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'community values most about their unique neighborhood. The neighborhood engagement for this effort has been inspiring. It started as as when I was a council aide. There have been countless small meetings of dedicated community volunteers. Numerous large task force gatherings and four community wide town halls.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Harkness Heights Neighborhood Association went door to door, making sure everyone's voice was heard and had one on one conversations with anyone who had not participated during the survey. At each step of the way, we've gone back to multiple levels of stakeholders to vet new information, carefully considering unintended consequences, and voting together on a path forward.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would like to thank everyone who has participated in this process, starting with my predecessor, Councilman Espinosa, who brought me Naomi McLendon, who goes above and beyond, has taken phone calls about the overlay and worked really diligently and methodically on this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would love to thank Brad for numerous hours he spent working with Naomi and myself, vetting information back and forth. And I would like to thank Tom Mobley, who led this and has been a champion of this over May for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Roberta Anderson, who is now the president and everyone on the small task force and the large task force. And most of all, once again, I'd have to say, I just have to thank my staff. Thank you, Gina, for setting up the meetings.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for going above and beyond. Thank you, Manny. And just my staff. I can't. None of this would be possible if I didn't have a staff supporting me and all my crazy zoning ideas that I say, let's make a difference.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it makes them work even harder. And I just have to say that the last overlay I mean, this overnight, we had to pivot. We had to pivot due to COVID. We did this while people were losing their family members.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We did this for people. We're experiencing something that no generation has ever experienced, a great pandemic. And we moved virtually. And I just want to say thank you to my community for pivoting and being able to move virtually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And thank you to my staff supporting me on long nights when I didn't know what to do. And you always just had confidence that we could figure it out together. And with that, I would ask for everyone's support.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And thank you to the CPD staff and Brad and all of your staff as well. Council member Sandoval and the speakers who joined us here tonight and shared their perspective. I'm happy to support both council bills 158 and 159.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And Madam Secretary, roll call on both of those bills, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sawyer. I. Torres. I. Whack. I see tobacco. I. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I.'",
