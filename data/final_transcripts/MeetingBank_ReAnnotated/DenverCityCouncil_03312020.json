        "'speaker_3': 'I move that council resolution 0224 be adopted.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It hasn't been moved. Can I get a second from somebody who has a screen? Thank you. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Council member CdeBaca. I think before we vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. For the next three contracts, I'm specifically calling them out because I believe that at a time like this, we need to be recalibrating and digging deep into our budget to reallocate dollars, more appropriately to meet the needs of this crisis.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do not believe that these entertainment promoter contracts are relevant at this point and should absolutely be something that we're considering after we've had an opportunity to recalibrate. It's also important to note that these two companies, one in this contract and one in the next, are the competitors on the National Western Triangle projects and are also'",
        "'speaker_5': 'slated to receive a $5 million stipend just to compete for that project. And so I think these are dollars that we should be holding on to for now until we figure out how to absorb this crisis. So I just wanted to make sure to go on record as a no for this contract tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council member council member Kasich.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you so much. I appreciate my colleague pulling this out. I think that we do have a limited pool of ticket promoters in the city, and we had a pretty long explanation from our department about that. You know, these two individual companies have got a corner on the market, so to speak, and are very difficult to work'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with. But we also have major entertainment venues in the city like Red Rocks, which we hope will be up and running again. I just want to clarify, though, this $8.5 million contract, the source of the funds, I do not believe it is general fund dollars.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it is not something that we could repurpose for the virus. So can the administration just speak to these are revenue contracts? I believe so. In terms of these these are not dollars we can free up. I certainly share some concerns about these companies.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I just want to make clear on what where the source of the funding is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Sky sought mayor's office. Thanks for the question. Arts and Venues operates as a special revenue fund, so the dollars come out of that special revenue fund. These are also commission contracts, so they only pay out in the case that the promoter actually books the show and the city receives revenue from that show.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The intent of these commission contracts is actually to increase city revenues with concessions and ticket sales associated with these large events that get booked in those facilities. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to share in the spirit of Councilmember City Barker's comments and that pretty much all the comments that we've received from our constituents have been frustrated with both vendors and their customer service or lack thereof.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Unfortunately, it does sound like these are the only vendors that have the the kind of infrastructure and size to to support a an operation as big as the city county Denver bite. But I would love to take this opportunity to say for both of these vendors, we would love for you to to improve your customer service so'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that you can service everyone in the city and all of your, you know, all of your customers. But particularly we're frustrated as as a as a district office, as a council district office, with the with all the comments of lack of customer service by both of these vendors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Sandbach you back up?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. It would be helpful if you could come back up, Skye. I do have a question about how contracts that were booked or performers that were booked, how we're handling that. A lot of artists that I know are recognizing that their contracts didn't allow them to get out of scheduled performances without a cost'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to them. And so I'm wondering how these concert bookings that we've had through these companies are being dealt with when they're canceled.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. Again, Skye Stewart, mayor's office. We did not have subject matter experts here tonight. We were asked to keep attendance low and didn't and weren't prepared to have questions asked of us. We were just told this was called out for a vote.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm sorry, I cannot answer that question. I can certainly have arts and arts and venues follow up with you to provide some information, but I don't know that off the top of my head.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is do you know what other things special revenue funds for arts and venues are spent on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So arts and venues itself is a special revenue fund. Their entire budget is encompassed in a special revenue fund, so that's all available in the budget book and again, can have them follow up with you if you'd like some more detail.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So so that means that all the dollars there can be spent on. Any of the components of their operations as needed, correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their their entire budget is a special revenue fund or actually multiple special revenue funds. So yes, that goes to all of their operations and they are divided up in different buckets associated with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember Clint Skye, stay there for a second. Thank you. Just to clarify, so that I'm that I'm certain about this, this is not an expenditure contract. This is a contract that pays a commission to these two, in this case, AEG.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then in the next resolution, live nation from the from the amounts of revenue that they derive from staging the event, this pays them a commission on that. So it's not funds that are coming out of a city fund as such.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's correct.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This one is a very problematic bill in front of us, and it's part of the two marijuana pieces of legislation coming before us tonight. The first one is to delay a year for allowing new licenses to enter the space.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And this second piece, I support the other piece. The second piece I do not support, because there have been several years of people really challenging the city to do better. As far as equity goals, we have almost a thousand licenses for marijuana in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I live in one of the most disproportionately impacted neighborhoods and we have less than five owners of people of color. And so the delay on the lottery to get a equity plan in place is appropriate. However, this second piece is opening up a new license type for research and development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've encouraged them strongly to have this as a opened up as a pilot for the current organization trying to get the license. Because if we open it up now, we're basically doing what we did when we first legalized.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we're only allowing we're taking an inequitable situation and deepening inequity because the only people who are allowed to have this license for research and development are people who currently have a license. That's a group we already know we have issues in and a lack of representation in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we're basically giving the companies that already represent inequity. We're giving them a head start on this type of license. There's also several things that have changed in the Colorado ecosystem around marijuana. We now can there's no residency requirement, Colorado residency requirement for marijuana licenses.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you also can invest from outside of the state into marijuana licensure. So we're opening up ourselves for big pharma, big tobacco to come in and dominate this space if they choose to. And I think right now is the time to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'If we're recalibrating on equity goals for the other piece of this, then we should also be putting this on pause and only doing the pilot part of this, not passing an entirely new license type without an equity plan in place.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It's just one more. Yes. Thank you. I received email communication today from a gentleman who is right now, I guess the only applicant in the in the wings waiting who is. A Denver native that grew up in northwest Denver, happens to be a Latino owner and is planning to move forward as soon as this bill passes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so the concern being expressed about equity, the only one lined up to do this is a Latino owner. So I have no problem with this bill moving forward tonight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Rocky, did you have something else that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Just wanted to clarify for Councilman Hines and Torres. Part of what we didn't do the first time when we legalized is plan ahead. We didn't speculate who would get involved, who would have the capital to be able to step into these spaces.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so we missed an opportunity to recognize that this is an industry that's dominated by people who come in with significant amounts of capital. We know how research and development spaces are dominated. And so when we're thinking about the future of the marijuana industry, we know that big tobacco is waiting in the wings to take over when'",
        "'speaker_5': 'this is federally legalized. And so now that we've changed the statewide requirements around who can invest and who can have licenses, this is something where we might have to extrapolate a little bit and prepare for. And while Councilwoman Ortega is on point, about the only person in line for this right now is a social equity applicant.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think that that is why it needs to be a pilot so that we're protecting the space and learning from it, because he's one of the only ones who can apply for it right now because he has a license already.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's already such a limited amount of people and there's such a lack of representation that we have to recognize that we're immediately putting people of color behind if we open up this space without it being tied to an equity plan.'",
