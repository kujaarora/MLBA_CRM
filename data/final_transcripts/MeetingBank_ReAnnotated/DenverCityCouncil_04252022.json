It will promote infill development where infrastructure and services are already in place, and it will also focus growth in transit stations.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed rezoning is also consistent with the urban neighborhood context as defined in Blueprint Denver. The proposed U. R. S five district is intended to promote safe, active and pedestrian scale diverse areas through the use of building forms that clearly define and activate the public realm.'",

Blueprint Denver describes these areas as having a mix of mid-scale multi-unit residential options. Some neighborhoods serving mixed use might be appropriate. Buildings are generally up to five storeys in height as proposed on district.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'The station area plan is more recent. It provides more recent land use recommendations and the older Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan. Still, the proposed zone district you are five is consistent with the overall goals of the plan. It supports housing options and the opportunity for a limited neighborhood serving commercial uses.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So if you approve, my Lord, just filling. That's the affordability. Not much. My my criteria. The people's criteria, what is actually affordable in this area. If you're really trying to keep the people that benefits, embrace that community, which I'm not this is not for people that have only lived in this neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This is for people that are very rich and wealthy. So I cannot support this to my I had a few questions. However, was there a good neighborhood agreement signed with the community? Was there a traffic study done? Was there a real study done?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Jonathan Bush with LCP development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you for being here tonight. I think it's always helpful to have the applicant in the room when we have questions. So under the I am x three, how many units would you have been able to build on this site?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know that we really looked at it as a three story, but I would guess two thirds of that count. So the order of 40 to 50, maybe.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. And I noticed looking at the site map, everything on Jason on that west side is all the IMX three zoning. So to the to the east, you've got the higher density zoning in. I understand that. Creates the zoning on the east side, creates the changing circumstances for the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this will now create that domino effect on the rest of Jason. And that is the most adjacent street to the more single family residential to the west. And so I was just trying to understand why you chose to go with the five story instead of the three story.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think one and this is one of many tuned projects we've done and I think is a as a 2D project that's hitting a block from light rail. I think there's a certain responsibility to have density around light rail.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so in looking at in kind of looking at the three storey townhouse at the West, and we stepped up to the project across the street, the alleyway, which is going to be eight stories, just felt like a natural height.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I mean, five storeys, as Bobby indicated, we met with the neighborhood on multiple times. They were very comfortable with that height, frankly, and I think they were encouraging about that height because of the proximity to light rail. So I think it was done for a lot of urban planning reasons, not just density.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So for 73 units, how many parking spaces will be required to?'",
        "'speaker_1': '56?'",
        "'speaker_0': '56. Okay. And then you've got one affordable at 60% of the am I and six at 80%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. I think those are all the questions I have. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. First of all, it's commuter rail over there, not light rail. It's the it's the larger one. The Fran, could you address a question about the Sunnyside neighborhood plan? 1992, it's 30 years old, but I know that Sunnyside is included in the is it called Near Northwest NPI?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I've not been following that process from Southwest Denver, but could you tell me from your knowledge, are you working on the Near Northwest MPI?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I am not. I'm sorry, I am not part of that MPI. I was leaving. Are you working?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I'm just wondering, do you know, is there anything in this application that is at odds with direction that that that MPI is headed?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No. And we brought it up to the team and we talked about it and we all agreed that that that's an area like we worked really closely with the developer into picking the appropriate districts. So we all agreed that that was what the plans call for and what our goals were, because at first they were asking for'",
        "'speaker_7': 'C and then we figure that Irvine was more appropriate for the area. And the five stories he explained was a good transition with the three, the eight. So we worked together on that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, so although we can't reference it because it's not an exact plan at this point, there's no concern that this would not be consistent with what's coming.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't think so, because a 44 person Fox station area plan, it's pretty accurate and it's still fairly new. So I think that that guidance is still pretty accurate. Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Thank you, Madam President. That's all I needed to know.'",

And I've been working with the Sunnyside neighborhood to figure out how to transition down to the protected zone district in between Jason and the alley and'",
        "'speaker_6': 'the next street over. And so I want to thank CPD and the applicant for working on that because although there is plan support for eight stories CPD because of the Neighborhood Planning Initiative, we have talked about the need for this to be more of a transition zone and it has coming in at five stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I want to also thank the applicant for working with the Sunnyside neighborhood, I think, Bobby, for being here in person. It matters when people show up, especially from registered neighborhood organizations, and this meets our plan guidance and all of the recommendations.'",
