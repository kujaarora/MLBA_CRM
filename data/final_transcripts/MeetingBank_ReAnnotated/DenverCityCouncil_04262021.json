The second letter opposition refers to their concerns with the applicant's intentions of renting the main property while living in the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Just as a reminder, the Denver zoning code requires the property owner to reside in either the primary dwelling unit or the accessory dwelling unit while residing in one unit. The owner might rent the other unit. Third letter only notes concerns, but does not specify what the concerns are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And finally, the letter of support explains that the way to use I already allowed nearby Sony would allow the owners to invest in the property with an appropriate use. As you know, the Denver zoning code has five review criteria that we're going to look at.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Two came to be combined into a single application? As far as I can tell, there is no relationship between the owners of the two properties, but it's rather unusual to see them bundled into a single application. In the staff report it said that and I don't know if this was their motivation, but it said it was less'",
        "'speaker_6': 'expensive and less time consuming because of the similarities between the two properties. Do you know how they came to come together and and why?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, good question because it's my first one. So I was also surprised by.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Two this ones.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they I think that they went together to talk to Councilwoman Sandoval's office. So they got advice that they could apply together if the if the applications were similar enough. So they came to me and at first I was like, I've never seen it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let's do two different applications. But then we talked to a team and we talked to somebody and we realized that they we had the same recommendation for both and they were similar enough that they could go together and that would save them having to pay for two applications.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that would save us the time, 2%, two times the same presentation. So, I mean, they they knew that the the risk was that if one of them gets denied and the other one is denied. So that was their risk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they were they were made aware of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And although being so similarly situated in their circumstances and in their request, it would be pretty hard for for the council in a quasi judicial setting to say one meets it and one does. It does. So basically, economy of scale and saving us the time of a third hearing tonight would be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great if we could do it more often.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And then the only thing that's different from the previous one is that they're looking to go to a to a different zone district designation because of the size of the lot. Under the current regulations, it would allow only an attached ADU and they were looking for detached in both cases.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So, so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they are currently they have the one. So in theory they should be allowed to have an EU, but they don't comply with the minimum. So not to do that. Right. So that's why they need to go down to be one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman Sandoval, for saving us one additional hearing tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Madam President. Thank you for the presentation, Fran. You did great presenting them together. So just so we're clear for the public, we are going from CS Omar, which is a bega's so they're actually going to a smaller zone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that correct? Because sometimes in at city council we see where people go to bigger zone lots and then add the one behind it, which allows the accessory, the detached accessory dwelling unit. And then they usually split the zone, right, so they can get two out of the one parcel.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But that's not what's happening in this situation, correct? They're going down because see the bigger zone at the end?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'B Yes. So they currently see one and that they should be they would be required to have 5500 square feet, but they only have 4700. So they're liking the. Don't make me do the math. Yeah, I know. 700 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So because they don't have it, they need to go down to be one that the minimum zone lot is 4500.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Council President And thank you again, CPD. Councilmember Sandoval, I want to give you the softball list of softball questions. You were great in saving us one one hearing tonight. Have you considered going bigger? Like maybe allowing me to use in an entire neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So yes, I've done Cherokee Park neighborhoods that had three driving units. I have Sloan's Lake in the Q right now. Then I'm headed into West Colfax. So Berkeley is on the list, but not higher. I have like two more neighborhoods that are higher than that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But yes, I'm making my way slowly you up Council District one to make sure that you don't have these one offs too, that it's just all zoned with accessory dwelling units. And then I'll be back to standards and then we'll get into the nitty gritty of all the standards.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you'll see me a lot talking about the standards so that we can get more of the gentle density and attainable housing into the Denver as a whole. But I'll happily use District One as a pilot.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Presentable for your word for general density or missing metal. But if you want to call it. Thank you, council president.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines and Councilmember Sandoval for the responses seen their hands raised. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 258. Councilmember Sandoval.'",
