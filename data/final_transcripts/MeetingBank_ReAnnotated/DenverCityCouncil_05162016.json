        "'speaker_12': 'But I'm going to push. I would love to see us do more arterials, so I'd love to see you out there doing even more work than you already are. So I want to have a bigger thank you next year for all the arterial work.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So, Mr. Mayor, let's get that in the budget because our arterials definitely need the attention. So thanks public works for the work you're doing because your reach is vast in your your staff is huge. But for the most part, we live in a very, very safe city thanks to the work that you guys are doing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman new.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to just congratulate the department as well and two things that that have come up recently. You know, the cost of construction has gone skyrocketing here in Denver. And you look at public works and they are affected more than any other department, just about because of all the building materials they have to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to purchase and to pave our streets and whatever. So for them to do the job they're doing and doing a good job with limited resource or reduced resources from a budget standpoint is phenomenal. So we need to recognize they're also we're looking to the future with transit and Kristi Fagan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Joe and her staff are doing a great job and we're looking forward to seeing that first transit installation implementation on Colfax and the bus rapid transit and and seeing transit develop in the city. So congratulations to the department and everyone in it.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just didn't want the opportunity to go by to thank the members of the public works. Y'all are the best partners that I've ever had. And constituent services. And you've saved my bacon more than once, I'll tell you.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And your responsiveness has been so great. And a lot of times I get to take the credit for. But I try always to say no. That's the men and women of the Public Works Department who got out there and got out there right away when people were having issues that public works can help with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I can't thank you enough for all you've done in the five years that I've been here.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Any other comments? 380. Say non, ma'am. Secretarial call.'",

        "'speaker_4': '11 Ice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ice three has been adopted. Excuse me, Councilman Clark, is there someone you'd like to invite to the podium to receive the proclamation?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Mr. President, I'd like to invite up George Delaney and Nancy Cunard.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Good evening, members of council. I'm George Delaney, chief operating officer for Denver Public Works and Deputy Manager. I want to thank you for the proclamation. And probably more importantly, I want to thank you for your expressions of appreciation for our staff.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And they do work very hard. They work very hard every day. And for them to know that you appreciate the work that they do is very meaningful. We're dealing public works, like most departments in the city are dealing with a very rapidly growing city and the demands that that puts upon our people.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We have high expectations of ourselves and we know the citizens and you all have high expectations of us. One of the things I wanted to point out to you, I don't know how many of you are familiar with this, but this is a plan that we put out every year.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It's called the Smart Plan, and this is our work plan that says here's what we're going to try to accomplish in the coming 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And it's a document that we.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Use to guide our work, but it's also a document that we can hold ourselves accountable to. And you can hold us accountable, too, because we do a report card on this every year. At the end of the year so that we can show how we're measuring up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So that's that's one of the ways that we are trying to adapt, trying to change, and trying to take on the challenges that we face in our department. We've also been working very hard with our employees on employee engagement, trying to the more and more pressure that's on you, the more hard work that you have to do'",
        "'speaker_13': '. The employees, their effectiveness, their efficiencies, it becomes very demanding. And we want our employees to be engaged to enjoy what they do and to come to a safe and hazard free workplace. So those that employee engagement initiative we've embarked upon is very critical to both manager Josie and the rest of us.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So, you know, Councilman Clark listed there are 12 employees of the end of the year. It's important to note that these employees of the year are selected by their peers. And so they are typically an employee who is an employee of the quarter and then were selected of the Final Four to be employees of the year by'",
        "'speaker_13': 'their peers. And I think that makes it even more relevant and more appreciated by our employees. So if I could have we have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A couple two here tonight. We have Stephanie Reid's here and Nate when but we also.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have a lot of other public works employees. Would you please stand to be recognized? You're the ones who do all the work.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Todd. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'For this honor. Thank you for the proclamation. And we will we plan to continue to serve you and meet your needs, as well as the citizens of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver in the years to come. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark, for bringing that forward. All right. We've got one more proclamation. 381 sponsored by Councilman Lopez. Will you please read proclamation 381?'",

Whereas, Hepatitis C disproportionately affects people of color and the majority of individuals living with the infection can be cured of the virus through the advent of effective treatment options currently available on the market.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have had the honor to read this proclamation for the last eight years, every single year, and I do so. It originally was going to be read by by then Councilman Garcia, who was absent, and I need you to read it in its place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as fate would have it, this is something really close to me. Something very close to my heart. I read it with pride, but also a little bit of sadness because this was the very same. Condition and virus that took my grandfather.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who died of cirrhosis of the liver caused by a hep C infection. And he had been a very healthy man his whole life. You know, worked very hard, proud guy. He had served our country in World War Two.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And he was injured. And he received a blood transfusion and they didn't test for that then. And so he had became infected with the Hep C virus. During his transfusion, he did not know about it until well, well, well into his life, until he realized he was going to he's going to pass away from it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's very meaningful for me to read this proclamation because I know there's a lot of people out there, especially especially folks that were in that age range and that were mostly baby boomers that are born between 1945 and 1965.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And as I said in the proclamation, are five times more likely than any other age group to be at risk and to have it and not even know it. And that's why it's important, because this is, you know, a while back, not too long ago, actually, this was almost a death sentence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And because of the resources, because of the research, because of the the work that that we as a world have put into this, there is now treatment and there's now even a cure. And it's important that we get folks into the into the laboratory get tested.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that's not no, it's not just for those that age group, but everybody. It's important to know that. So we will be actually having a free hepatitis C testing day this Thursday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the atrium of the Webb building.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. I'm so honored to be here once again. And also thank you to Councilman Lopez, who's been our champion for so many years. We really do appreciate it. We gave you lots of statistics in that proclamation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I understand that. So it's it's kind of daunting to remember everything. So I'll give you one more statistic to throw at you. The CDC has 60 reportable conditions that they get statistics about on an annual basis. Hepatitis C is one of those statistics, one of those reportable conditions, as well as HIV and many other things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In 2014, the number of deaths related to hepatitis C surpassed the number of deaths for all 60 conditions combined. This is this is a big deal. This is a serious illness. And because the prevalence is so great among baby boomers and so.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Own communities, but we're honored to be able to do this. It's free. We will test baby boomers mainly, but we're happy to test anyone with any risk factor. There's a lot of risk factors. If you were a veteran in and served in the Vietnam War, that's a possibility because of blood transfusions at that time as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They didn't start accurately testing the blood supply until 1992, and that wasn't really that long ago. So we encourage everyone to either visit us at the Webb building on Thursday or please ask your primary care physician because the test is considered free for baby boomers, because that is a risk risk group.'",

    "Text Amendment to Allow Short-Term Rentals as Accessory Use in Residential Zones.": [
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Since this is the zoning measure and we have a required public hearing in four weeks, I just wanted to take the occasion to ask staff and anybody who is listening, who intends to come down here for this public hearing on short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I want to. To make to disclose some of the issues that I wanted addressed at the hearing. Okay. This ordinance is addressing an industry that whose business model is based on violating our current zoning laws. So we're looking at making a fundamental change in how we've regarded commercial activity in residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I would like some and I know I've distributed this to members, to my colleagues on the council and a few others. But this is a map of all the short term rental listings in the city. I don't know if Channel eight can zoom in on that or not.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'As of a point in mid-January, and I know they change from time to time, but it should be apparent from this map that while we are taking a one size fits all immediate legalization of short term rentals in every residential neighborhood, the demand is concentrated in only certain neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I'd like staff and any witnesses who want to testify to address why we should not look at a more tailored approach as to where we permit commercial intrusion and encroachment into traditionally residential neighborhoods. So that's one thing.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Also, in our zoning code, we have plenty of provision for what we call home occupations, and we require a process called a zoning permit with informational notice for these. And if a person wants to repair watches in his basement for his customers, that requires a zoning permit.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'If they put in an art studio in their home, it requires a permit if they want to tutor students home tutoring. It requires a zoning permit. It's matter of fact, one of our home occupations is rooming house, but that's defined as being longer than 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It requires notice to the neighbors posting of the property and a zoning permit. So I'd like to I'd like some input on why we are adopting approach and approach of making this short term rental, which is nothing more than a rooming house for less than 30 days.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Why are we making this a use by right everywhere? When the guy next door who might rent as a rooming house for longer than 30 days has to go through all the notification of neighbors. So I need some more input on why we are not being consistent and why we're why we're affording this disparate treatment to short'",
        "'speaker_13': 'term rentals as opposed to any other home occupation. Did you to do and also the last thing I like addressed is the the amount of resources we believe will be required to enforce this. The reason I raised that is just in the last couple of weeks, I've been able to go through a few of the listings online'",
        "'speaker_13': ', and I have found that there are some hosts on some of the platforms who have converted basements into basically into accessory dwelling units under the radar. So they've taken a single family home, they've made a duplex out of it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But in these basements, they have locked doors and they have four kitchens. And so I'm wondering what kind of resources we have to devote to enforcement of our zoning fire and building codes in this instance. So, Mr. President, those are the the major questions I would like to see addressed at the hearing in four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And for those watching, if you're unaware, should to 61 be ordered to publish? There will be a required public hearing on Monday, June 13th. Councilman, you dropped out. Councilman Espinosa, you got a question or comment or you want to called out.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'For a vote and just a comment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead, sir.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just I'm glad to follow Councilman Flynn's comments. I, too, am looking forward to seeing those answers. I have more thorough comments that I have that I'll be saying in the subsequent to 62 Bill. But it's consistent with what he's saying there in that there is a lot a lot of lot that needs to be still figured'",
        "'speaker_12': 'out. We're going to be the onus is going to be on us trying to solve it in real time after these bills are are passed. If they're passed. And we've been down this road with marijuana. And I see parallels when you legalize something citywide and you're not properly equipped for it.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So to that end, when we do something like this citywide, I get it. When we did the legislative rezone in 2010, that was a much more complex thing and nuance thing and whatnot. But this is a single issue and I think this should have gone to the vote of the people.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We should be voting on a ballot measure and letting you guys decide and then coming up with regulatory rules, not just putting it out there like this. And I'm not one, I'm not afraid, not shying away from my responsibility as an elected official.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But but this is a citywide thing. I actually represent one of those districts that heavily has a lot of stores in northwest Denver. But what what's good for northwest Denver and a couple other council districts may not be good for the balance of the city.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And I would like you guys to make that decision for yourselves. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Sussman, comment to 61.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Just comment. Thank you to my council men for raising the questions. I think that you'll find on the night of the hearing that you'll find some really good answers to those questions. We've been looking at this for two years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not the first time we've done a zoning change throughout the city. Just recently, the council did the Cottage Foods zoning change throughout the city. It is a common practice by the city and certainly this is one of those bills that has been studied very closely, not only by the planning staff, but also excise and license and'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not the least by community members who we talked with for quite a while and look forward to the conversations on the night of the public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Any other comments or questions? On to 61. All right. That was not called out. So we're going to go to 262 and we've got Councilmembers Flynn, new Espinosa and Susman. I'm sure somebody wants to call this out for a vote.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Yes. And I believe Councilmembers Flynn and Espinosa have amendments at offer. So let's first make sure. Councilman Lopez, can you make the motions for us tonight?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'President. All right. So we'll start with Councilman Flynn. You called out to 62. What would you like to do this?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You. You read my mind and the script. I have an amendment that would like to allow for a vote. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, so council members that we had an electronic issue, but you should have copies of both amendments on your desk so you can refer to those when the council members offer their amendments. Councilman Lopez. First, we need on the floor to be ordered to publish where you please put 262 on the floor to be ordered published'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill to 62 series of 2016 be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It has been moved in second. All right, Councilman Flynn, you're at first. Go ahead and offer your amendment.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I have an amendment to offer that is aimed at addressing the issue of homeowner associations and coven and private covenants that may also deal with the same question. So if I may, I would like to to move this, read this amendment, and move it on the floor.'"

    "Short Term Rental Licensing and Regulation Ordinance.": [
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Mr. President, I move to amend Council Bill 16 to 62 and the following particulars on page two, line 25. And this refers to the hard copy as opposed to the paginated copy on page two, line 25.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'After the word premises, insert the following. In addition, the applicant shall attest on the application whether or not the property upon which the licensed premises is proposed to be located is subject to any private restrictive covenants or other private contractual restrictions on the use of the property.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And if so, whether the use of the property for short term rentals will comply with any such covenants or restrictions. The director shall deny any application upon which the applicant has self-reported that a short term rental would violate covenants or other restrictions applicable to the property.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to impose any duty on the director to independently verify any representations by the applicant in regard to restrictive covenants or other private contractual restrictions on the use of the property, or to interpret or to enforce any such covenant or restriction.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. It's been moved and seconded. Comments you want to add in, Councilman Flynn?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Just briefly. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. As many of my colleagues and other members of the public know, I've been working on some alternate approach along the lines of what I explained about council to 61 of my concerns there about how we are commercializing residential neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I would point out that, yes, the council did pass citywide cottage foods into as a zoning text amendment, but we also require a zoning permit with informational notice for that permit as well. So I think it's very important that we not initiate or be the cause of private party disputes in covenant communities.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Most of the members of this body and I won't go into the particulars of it, but they remember that I had one such incident instance in my district that was particularly troublesome, that involved in a way and a short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And that is that is thankfully has been resolved. But I want to make sure that we don't issue licenses to conduct an activity that by private contract the licensee has agreed not to do there. Just one brief story up in Councilman Espinosa's district.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'A friend of mine is in a townhouse association, seven units up in North Denver, and they found that one of the unit owners apparently had moved but was renting the unit short term. And and it took them quite a while.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It was quite an ordeal, too, to put a stop to it. But in the midst of it, my friend, there was a bus stop across the street and and there was a house across the street that everybody thought was a drug house.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'There were a couple of drug dealers who lived there. And when she went out to wait for the bus one day, one of the drug dealers came out to her and said, Do you feel safe over there? We noticed there's a lot of coming and going and a lot of strange people going in and out of the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'out of your condo association. Do you feel safe? So I think when drug dealers start worrying about your safety, it's time that we take pause and examine where we're doing this and where are we allowed and what are the rules.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Council members knew. And Espinosa, you're in the Q. I just want to make sure you want to comment on the motion or did you have a comment on the larger bill? Larger bill. Okay. We'll come we'll come back to as amended then councilman another on the motion or to the larger bill.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Larger bill.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. We'll we're walking down then, Councilwoman Sussman on the motion to amend.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'On the motion to amend, go read it. Okay. I'd like to ask a couple of folks to come up and address this particular amendment. Let me start with excise and license. Will it be sisolak? Sir, Nathan Batchelder would like to address how you are addressing the HRA information.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Good evening, council president, members of Council Nathan Batchelder here with access licenses. I think we share the same concern with Councilman Flynn and the fact that we are actually providing a proactive approach to educating and notifying our short term rental applicants that they need to actually check with their HRA and and look through those rules of those'",
        "'speaker_14': 'covenants to make sure it's an operation that's all allowed. The way we're planning to do that is through our short term rental starter kit. Our starter kit will essentially be a separate web portal that gives the applicant a checklist of sorts that they will check through.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And one of those checklists will actually direct the applicant to check with your HRA, make sure that your rules and your covenants allow this before you even start applying. So I think we also value and respect the covenants and the rules that are agreed to by archways.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We actually have a much more proactive approach with our framework to make sure people are in compliance with their homeowners associations in the first place. Secondly, I think the department would have concerns any time that it's put in the situation of interpreting private contractual homeowners association language.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So our current framework gives us both abilities. We'll be able to have that proactive approach of making sure that the applicant goes through our checklist and make sure that they check with their homeowner's association before they apply. And it also distances the city and the department from interpreting private contracts and HRA language of hundreds of highways in'",
        "'speaker_14': 'the city. But we absolutely do value and respect all the ways in the county that the city can offer. And we feel it's a partnership as well as a proactive educational campaign with all of our applicants.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. Noted Miss Locks, did you also want to address this? Okay. The second question I have, is there concern that if we put ourselves in the place of making sure somebody is informed their H0? A I'm wondering what legal consequences that might have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Archways have lots of rules. They have rules sometimes about design, house design, sidewalks, fences, what you can build and what you can't. And in no other instance do. We asked people applying for those permits whether they have talked with their house or not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This would be the only time that this request would be made. I think that it may have implications for that are distinctions between the public sector and the private sector. I wonder if Mr. Broadwell would address that for us and what what sorts of things that this might mean.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'David Broadwell, assistant city attorney. Well, first of all, in answer to your question, I'll call your attention to the last sentence and the amendment. And that is an attempt on my part to recommend to the councilman that we we stay away from those kind of problems by disclaiming that the director of excise and License is placed in'",
        "'speaker_13': 'a position of having to interpret the covenant. And this is essentially a self-reporting thing by the applicant, but doesn't get us in the business of adjudicating whether or not the permit will violate the covenants or not. One of the things that that of most local government attorneys like myself kind of learned early on, Councilwoman, as you indicated'",
        "'speaker_13': ', is that private restrictive covenants kind of exist in a parallel universe out there. And there's a tremendous amount of conflict that happens between highway boards and individual homeowners in terms of interpreting and enforcing covenants that don't involve the municipality at all.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And as you indicated, there are innumerable ways where cities regulatory laws may grant a permit or grant a license. But anyone receiving a perimeter license has a completely independent duty to deal with a homeowner's association if they're in one, and the deal with whatever civil liabilities they might have.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So in this case, this would be unique, as far as I know, in terms of any of our regulatory laws, where a formal part of the application process would be a check off by the applicant in regard to the fact that they've vetted their covenants, if any, and are willing to attest to whether or not what they're'",
        "'speaker_13': 'applying for complies. But we've attempted to mitigate any sense that the director is going to be judge, jury and executioner in terms of deciding whether the covenants actually do apply to short term rentals, that we're not placing ourself in that position.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So simply, it's essentially a reporting requirement by the applicant themselves. The only way that this amendment would force the director to do anything is if they've actually affirmatively self-reported. I checked, and it does appear to violate the covenants in that case, if they have attested and actually dare to say that on the face of their application, then'",
        "'speaker_13': 'then she's directed by this language to deny the license. But it is admittedly an unusual thing. It's not something we've done in our other regulatory laws. And believe me, from the little bit I do know about a litigation over covenants, there's a lot of subjectivity that is involved in whether or not a particular use does or doesn't'",
        "'speaker_13': 'involve or does, doesn't it doesn't implicate the covenants. Just in the last couple of hours, I found a recent court of appeals decision in Colorado that in fact involved a question about whether or not short term rentals violated covenants in a community down by Telluride.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And in that case, the homeowner one was sued by the homeowners association, but the court ultimately sided with the homeowner's ability to use the property for for short term rental in that case. But it turned on the very specific wording of the covenants that were in play in that case.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So lo and behold, this is actually a live issue that is being litigated out there between private houses and the people who live in those communities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you very much. This is that's probably my major concern about putting the HRA notification here. My first one is that we're doing some proactive stuff to make sure that the people who are applying for this kind of license will know what they need to do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And they need to check with their HRA and they need to check with their landlord. And we have that sort of education process that we're going to be doing between July and December. But secondly, if we. Start with this particular ordinance that you must inform your house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Whether or not we get involved. I think we raised the expectations of the community that the city will get involved in your litigation between you and your. And that opens up a great big morass that would worry me very much.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I encourage my fellow council persons not to pass this amendment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Espinosa, you now say you do have a question about the motion.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, just in Nathan's response, actually.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So. Well, I agree that it would generally be a morass. So you won't see me supporting this for for a whole host of reasons. It does it does mean that that situation exists. And if if David's over here talking about the confusion and that's already in live, as he said, you know, to expect homeowners to know and'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to figure that out themselves what degree their A rules and covenants do or do not allow this. It's easier just to check that box and move on. And and that's obviously happening because there are two ways that do prevent this, that these do exist.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so tell me, if somebody goes through the process, checks the box, what is the and it is I don't know how we find out that there's something wrong. But then he gets into the that person gets into the situation where they have done this against their H-2A rules.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What what is the what is the penalty phase for that?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right. So with that particular instance, with a short term rental unit that is not in compliance with their H-2A, their H-2A will be able to issue whatever penalties and fines within their own private covenants for that particular unit.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I can tell you, I think it's more of a partnership right now between excise and licenses and the rest of the city's owners. We've spoken to several property managers and H-2A representatives who can actually partner with us of enforcement of our ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'For example, if there are some eateries or property management companies that know of a situation where a unit is not their primary residence, they might not be meeting safety features or they might be violent. Any other conditions of the city ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We can actually partner with those organizations and those folks to make sure our enforcement tools are working just as well.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we'll always have the capacity to where you have sort of a blacklist or something like that where you can then submit the addresses for their units that are then no longer applicable, meaning they're not allowed to get license, or.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If it's a complaint of a short term rental that's violating any condition of the ordinance. So not now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They first have to do it illegally and get to the point where then there's repercussions.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That you can't proactively as in HUAC are addresses are off limits.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If that's taken care of within the private covenants and the enforcement of the specific nature ways. Right. So there's that conversation and what actually happens within their own rules and in their own covenants and how they enforce those own covenants.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But what we can do in addition is to partner with each of ways. If there is complaints about people operating a short term rental unit, that might not be a primary residence, that might not be displaying an ad online, or they might be violating the conditions of the but.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If we're going to register all these licenses, why wouldn't we be able to also populate that registry with licenses mean addresses that are not licensable by voluntarily by organizations, that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There's nothing in our ordinance precludes such a contract language, if that makes sense. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Now, so back to where I really was going. So then, okay, so they voluntarily do this. They get to that point where it is recognized through your processes that it was not the way cut them off and says you can do this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'At what point does it become some sort of violation of excise and licensing rules and what is the repercussion to that? That may mean that STR operator.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. So if we took a complaint from in a way, we would investigate that complaint accordingly with our inspectors. So we would ask we would first make sure they're licensed. Right. And if they're licensed, we would make sure that they are the proof of premise.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They have permission from the property owner. They've been displaying their license number on the advertisement and that they meet all the conditions of the license itself. Right. So we would be able to actually partner with those management companies to make sure they're following the city ordinance that was actually stipulated in our licensing ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That's separate from whatever restrictions or covenants are placed on short term rentals within the actual H-2A.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So thank you for that. And the reason why I had that line of questioning is that's pretty much the answer that I've been getting since we've been asking the question since January, which is that there are no clear penalties, there is a penalty process, but there are so many hurdles and other bits and pieces and parts to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the where enforcement lies is sort of all over the place. And that is inherently one of my problems with this bill is that there needs to be a clear penalty. That is direct. When a violation is found, a fine is issued and the person is is no longer able to operate that if they're not operating consistent with'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the rules of licensure.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. And we have lots of tools within.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But it's a very, very evolved process. And the fact that you can directly say this is what happens when this when this fails has been an issue for me.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yeah. So I might actually defer to our senior attorney who can go into a little more details about what that licensure fee and penalty might be, including potential perjury.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But the process to get to perjury is not direct.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Kelly Moore, on behalf of the city attorney's office. So I understand your concern.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If I'm going 75 and a 55, I get a ticket. If I'm if I'm wrongly checking a box on my license or application, what happens?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So there's always the discretion of an officer when you're speeding to get that ticket to say whether or not you actually get them. So while I understand that from your perspective, it's very cut and dry with speeding, there's actually a wide range of possible penalties in that realm, too.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'When we look over here, it's similar. If you are checking the box that says that you are complying with your terms and the you get caught lying, you could be subject to those penalties and then there could be charges filed against you as a crime.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The Department of Excise and Licensing could also file to show cause against your license for that violation of itself. And we go through a due process hearing that way, which would then have your license potentially be revoked and you wouldn't be able to do the short term rental anymore.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So. While it's not clear cut, I don't think there's anything when you violate the law that is a clear cut penalty that you're looking for to say if you do this, then that because we do have due process rights that attach to the issue a license to an individual.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Which is why I can dodge on photo radar ticket if I want. Right. Because that doesn't ask me whether I violated the speed or not. So that sounds like a lot of city expenditure to go through that process just to get somebody to I mean, just to to really say that that you shouldn't have been operating.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is the licensee culpable for the charge? I mean, the charges that are incurred by the city throughout that process?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I mean, that's something we could work into our our processes and our rulemaking. And I don't think that necessarily has to be set out now.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Enhancements as we got a little broader, broader to 62 in general. I hope that we can focus colleagues just on this motion right now because there's another motion and then there's Bill as amended. So there will be plenty of time to comment on this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if we could have you just ask if you could just focus specifically on Councilman Flynn's motion. Councilman Ortega, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I appreciate this line of questioning that we've been going through. I was at a meeting with an HLA group in Lower Downtown and they're actually having to research the various sites that advertise because they know they have some people in their building that are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Basically renting out their unit as short term rentals and they have no other way of being able to find out who it is other than to have to play cat and mouse and try to track down who it is that that's renting their unit, which is in direct violation of their own.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think the concern is that this puts a lot of onus and responsibility on the boys to try to find out how. You know, who's who's doing this within their development and then what that recourse is and hearing the line of explanations of how that gets resolved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's it's lengthy and it's expensive. And so it's putting the burden on the airways to try to solve the issue when there is someone who is knowingly violating the rules. And, you know, a lot of this hopefully will be resolved in the education process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But there may be some people choosing to ignore the process. And even if someone doesn't have a license and they are doing this, can I've been asked the city attorney this question. Do they still go through the. The normal process to prove that they should not be allowed to operate even though they don't have a license.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that the onus would be on the licensee, that they would have to prove that they are allowed to operate. And if they aren't allowed to operate, then they could be subject under our general ordinance guidelines that if anything is unlawful, you could be subject to up to a $999 fine and up to a year in jail'",
        "'speaker_11': '. So it would go through the court procedure that way, if that answers your question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, it does. So thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Flynn, I'm going to hop over you. We got some couple other people who rang in, hopefully to talk about the motion. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just trying to determine if there is a net benefit to this amendment. So I guess I have a question for you, Nathan. Does this amendment change the enforcement of this proposed law?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'No. There is no language in the ordinance right now that discusses private contractual language. And really what we plan to do, I think, is similar to what the sponsor of the amendment is to have that approach, that framework where we tell an applicant to check with their actuaries, to check with their covenants to make sure this isn't'",
        "'speaker_14': 'allowed use.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. And then, Councilman Flynn, I have a question for you. So it sounds like it does achieve the same thing. That will be part of their rules. And I wonder if it's confusing if with their long list of rules that this is the one that is in the law and the other ones aren't, and then'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it might set up false expectations.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Mm hmm. Okay. I, I can say that I'm not confused by it, and I'm only confused by why why other members might consider not supporting this because it simply puts into the ordinance what the exercise of the license already is, has said it's going to do.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It just requires them to do what they've already agreed to do. And the reason I want it in the ordinance is to maintain that requirement through the years. The only thing that it adds is it asks that that directs the director to deny the license of the self-reporting.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Applicant says, I'm not permitted to do this by private contract. That's the only difference. And there are 850, give or take, homeowner associations registered in the city and county of Denver. This amendment in no way requires the division of the exercise of a license to look at any of the covenants, to examine them, to study any of'",
        "'speaker_13': 'them. It simply puts into the ordinance the requirement that they do what they've already said they're going to do by rule. I would rather see that as a requirement to ensure that it gets done down years down the road.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Katherine Black. Any other questions?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No, thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You. All right, Councilman, do you now have a question about the motion? Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, sir. Ask the city attorney one question. There are some are questioning the councilman. Last question. Does this amendment give you the greater ability for enforcement? Enforcement is a big, big issue. And I just wonder, does this help strengthen the enforcement process by having this in the ordinance?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I don't know that it would. It's a self at at attestation. So by merely checking the box, if someone does lie on that application, we have to go through the show cause procedure to then revoke their license. And then I think we would be getting into the very thing that Councilwoman Susman is afraid of, is that then'",
        "'speaker_11': 'we would be interpreting private contracts.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So if they don't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Abide by you have to go through that process anyway.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We do, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so by them checking the box is proof that they that is evidence that they are not comply.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well checking the box would give us evidence that they lied on their application fee. So if the license was then granted, we'd have to go through the due process claim. Typically, people who apply for licenses and they are denied also get a denial hearing to object to the denial of a license to.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So we'd have to go through that process.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Seemed like it would help you a little bit. All right. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman there, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And my apologies to my colleagues for being late due to a family emergency. But I do appreciate that Councilman Flynn gave us some advance notice about this amendment. I did not get a chance to talk with the city attorney about my question in advance, but it was raised by other council members.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I just want to play out a scenario. I actually don't have a philosophical issue. I know some of my colleagues do. They don't like putting things in ordinance that could be in regulation or that could be input in other places.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I'm a believer that sometimes it's comforting to have things in an ordinance if you're going to do them anyway. So I don't have a philosophical problem with that kind of ordinance drafting. I am worried, though, about unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I want to think through a scenario where a sincere owner has a difference of opinion with their HRA about what their articles do or don't say. And the scenario I'm concerned about is an owner attests that, you know, they read the language they think it allows subletting, for example, let's say that it says subletting and they'",
        "'speaker_11': 'think that that means that they can do a short term rental. And the House says no, subletting is different than a short term rental. And and then the department is indeed notified by this. And now we have a situation where the department is in a decision making mode about actually pursuing perjury charges against someone who who knowingly'",
        "'speaker_11': ', you know, checked the box. So that's the scenario of an unintended consequence. So I don't know if either Mr. Bardwell, who helped to draft this or, you know, the city attorney who's advising the department, want to comment on if indeed given notice by an HRA that a unit is potentially in noncompliance, whether that obligates you to begin'",
        "'speaker_11': 'a hearing against someone, even if there's a difference of opinion.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The intent of the draft is absolutely not to obligate us to conduct a hearing and to send them to district court if they want to argue about the meaning of their covenants in a case, as you described. So that's what's intended again.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The last verbiage we included in the drafting in Councilman Flynn, including that in the drafting, was intended to make that point that we're not going to be the forum in which those kind of differences get adjudicated. But that that's the intent, Councilwoman.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And because because it's based on the concern you just expressed, it does get the city into an unusual place. When, when, when, when, when assertions about compliance with covenants are not becomes a little bit our responsibility because we're building it into our regulatory codes in terms of making it part of the application process.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And another aspect of this, just to reiterate, is that the one definitive thing the draft the amendment requires the director to do is if they've been so bold as to say, yeah, there's covenants and I think I'm in violation of them, that only in the most clear cut case where they've self affirm something that definitive does is'",
        "'speaker_13': 'say to the director to do anything, and that is to deny under that narrow circumstance, but not when there's some debate or some difference.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I realize that scenarios are dangerous, but I just want to play this out so it doesn't obligate the department to take action, but does it allow the department to take action? So, for example, let's say renewal is coming up and one of the provisions elsewhere in the ordinance states that license renewal does have a review of'",
        "'speaker_11': 'if you have violated any of these, you know, provisions and you start to have neighbors who are petitioning to say this should not be renewed. So I just want to ask, does the language allow the department to take action against the individual?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, I'll defer to Biz Morey if she wants to comment on this one as well. But I would say, no, this doesn't affirmatively allow or require or anything else a director to get involved in those kinds of disputes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'It doesn't create a basis for denial based upon an external allegation that the covenants are being violated. That's that's intentionally left out of the language for, you know, for a lot of the reasons you're articulating in terms of not just not wanting to go there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So so I think the answer to your question is no. And I don't know if Ms.. Morey wanted to comment on that one.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I would agree with Mr. Broadwell. I don't think it obligates the director to say no or say yes or not. Get involved. No, no, no, no. But remember, my question in this round wasn't about whether you're obligated, it's whether you may.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I believe that the amendment's written in broad enough that the director may get involved. Okay. That that right there is my concern. So I'm going to move to comments really quickly. But I just wanted to clarify procedurally, when we have our public hearing on the zoning amendment, was there a courtesy public hearing on'",
        "'speaker_11': 'the regulatory bill coming run first reading tonight?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. If if both passed, Councilman Susman will like to 62 to move at the same pace as to 61 so they'll both be on the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I guess.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I am concerned about unintended consequences. I think I'm fine with the idea that you want to require people to pause and look at their HRA. I'm concerned about an unintended consequence because it happens now where neighbors come, they say, we want you to take action on this renewal.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We think they lied on their application and there's political pressure and there's community pressure and the department has the authority to take that up. That to me is confusing. So for tonight, I'm going to vote no in the amendment.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I would invite folks to give, I guess, public testimony on this point. I'd love to hear some input during the hearing. Perhaps it may or may not be on point with the zoning hearing, but to me we have a second reading.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But but I'm philosophically supportive of the idea of saying to folks, stop, pause, look at your HRA. I do not want a situation where neighbors feel like they have language in the ordinance to petition the department to somehow be engaged.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just given that people really do have sincere disagreements with their ways on interpretation all the time, and it'll take time for each of us to revise their bylaws to get clearer on this point. I'm just I'm a little nervous that we're ahead of that and we're going to create some unintended consequence.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So no, for tonight. But I'm open to understanding, you know, people's perspective on it and thinking about it more. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Each. All right. The only person that hasn't come in yet in the queue. Councilman. Clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. You know, I think that I share some of the concerns about getting involved in these private agreements, and I would not support this if I felt like that did this. I also I have some trepidation, although I agree philosophically with where Councilman Espinosa was going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I had the same thoughts on, well, if we know the statute doesn't allow it, why can't we preemptively put those addresses in there? But bylaws can change with a simple vote at one board meeting one month. And I don't think we get involved in this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that this amendment, however, is very simple. It is written and was crafted very well, and it says the director shall deny any appli or application upon which the applicant has self-reported and then goes further on to say Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to impose any duty on the director to independently verify.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I believe that the way this is written. I am not convinced that this gives us a whole lot more than what's already in there. Their him. But it is one level above I'm checking off. Oh, did I go through my check sheet?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Now I'm saying to the city I did these things. So it's one step higher. It's not a big step. So I'm not convinced that it's completely necessary, but I have absolutely no problem supporting this. I think that it's crafted in a way that I don't think that it will lead to unintended consequences.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think will put us in a sticky spot, which I would not support it if I felt at all that it would. On And while I have very few active activities in my district, if this provides a level of comfort to the constituents that my colleagues like Councilman Flynn are representing on ways and I'm very happy'",
        "'speaker_2': 'to support it. I think in in some ways and this will be very interesting as we get into public hearings on the bigger issue that we are making a mountain out of a molehill on this one. I think that it's simple, it's straightforward.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It gets us a little tiny step further than what we have in the language, and I'm happy to support it. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. All right, round two. Talking on the motion. Councilman Flynn, you back up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. The. There are many unintended consequences to every action that we take. Every single bill will have unintended consequences. The one that this amendment is is aimed at addressing is the unintended consequence of the city suddenly issuing licenses that could impact up to 850 homeowner associations.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And the unintended consequence that we are causing civil disputes among these parties through our actions when requiring the applicant simply to go and check and verify that they can do this, is all that this amendment does. My hope is that we can prevent.'",
        "'speaker_13': '100, 200, 800 problems between private parties out there through the unintended consequence that is more likely to happen than the director being politically pressured into holding a show cause hearing that the that the audience doesn't require her to do in the first place.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The Telluride case that that Mr. Broadwell spoke to he briefed me on that very he briefed me very briefly before the meeting. And although I'm not a trained lawyer, I've watched enough Matlock to be able to understand. But the Telluride case hinged on the covenants in that case.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And Mr. Broadwell, jump in and correct me if I'm wrong, where the covenants were very vague and did not say you can't do short term rentals less than 30 days or what have you. It was a more broadly written part of the covenants that they had sued over.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And in this regard, this would require the applicant to look at the covenants and not look for the provision in Telluride, which was only residential uses can be performed. No commercial uses can be conducted in the in the premises of this particular association.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So I the unintended consequence I'm trying to avoid is for the city to ignite all these dozens, hundreds or whatever they might be of problems that don't need to happen with this one simple little checkbox that the division already has said they intend to do through their education campaign.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The. And the final thing was on. Oh, that this is a unique action we're taking. It's been a while since Councilwoman Sussman had asked this question. This is sort of unique in that we don't have any provisions in our zoning office when a homeowner comes in and wants to put up a fence.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'We don't check whether their H-2A allows them to have a fence. I agree with that. But in this case, we are looking at taking a long standing. We've had long standing rules on fences. After all, your fence can't be more than four feet high if it's front forward of the front line of the house, for example.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So if we suddenly changed our ordinance and said, you can have a six foot fence in your front yard, I think we need to understand what the implications of that are here. We are taking an activity that has been illegal since at least the 56 zoning code and probably the one that that replaced back in 1956.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And we are saying suddenly tomorrow you can do this anywhere in a city. And so we're we're lowering the bar on commercialization in our neighborhoods. And because of that unique circumstance and because this is a change in use, this isn't a fence or it's not a purple.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'You know, we're not painting a house purple in violation of covenants. This is this is an introduction of a commercial use into residential neighborhoods. So I think it's highly appropriate that we afford highways, this little bit of cushion so that they don't they don't they don't face as many problems with licenses that we issued, licenses that we'",
        "'speaker_13': 'issue down the road. I think that was all that I have. Oh, and just to Councilwoman Black, the net benefit I believe the net benefit from this amendment is that we reduce the number of potential conflicts between private parties.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I know the highway in my neighborhood that had to address the one situation that you're all familiar with, had to go through a lot of pain and expense to take care of that situation. I want to try to avoid that.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think this will prevent some of them. Not all of them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you all for all your comments. I just as you can hear from the comments, my concern is that we're putting it in here. With the language that but we're not going to do anything about it. And it seems like it's for show because we already have these restrictions that we are going to impose in our rulemaking'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And so why would we put in the expectation and expectation for an applicant or the HRA that we will enforce your rule that that for you, that we will help you in your and in your concern over an STR.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We already intend to be proactive about this. But the other thing that concerns me is that we are that the community members out there who I have talked with for two years are just hearing about this tonight. And the whole ordinance wasn't done in a vacuum.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was done with the I and C neighbors who worried about this and looked on this worked. We worked with the stakeholder community. We worked with the neighborhoods, not just ANC, but individual neighborhoods. And here they are hearing about it for the first time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is this is something that I think should have been taken to a committee. We've been talking about it since for two years. But we have new council people. We've been talking about it since July. This is. For months.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is me. And that's quite a long time to have maybe brought this before. So we could have vetted it with the community to see what they think about that. But now it's just coming tonight. And I, I think it might be wise for us to we we have in place we're going to have an advisory group'",
        "'speaker_5': 'with all the stakeholders afterwards to take a look to see if we've done it right. Have we missed some points? And that stakeholder group is going to be the same sort of folks that we talked to for the last two years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't know why we need to start changing the regulations at the last at the 11th hour.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You know, I just in my little familiarity with these attestation forms. You basically are sitting there affirming the following statement. So I'm trying to figure out if this is doing nothing or if it's really doing nothing. And what I mean by that is, is if.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If there is a if there's a situation where it's in dispute, the license has been issued. We're not talking about revoking the license. We're not going to change the status at all whether this statement is in there or not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And that person wrongly checked the box that said, tell me about the form. Does your will you ever get to this situation where you're not checking the box and getting license? Because don't you have to check the box and attest that you've already verified this with your covenants and it's a it's acceptable in order to get to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'the point where your licenses have been issued. Or can you actually will you be issuing licenses without this box checked?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Some of this will sort of depend on the technology that we implement. But I think the thought is for now actually honored different steps of the application. You will actually not be able to move forward if you don't check the box, if you don't certified.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's like trying to use my app without agreeing to the licensing terms.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So. So for example, if one of the questions will ask you for a proof of premise or permission for a property, or if you, if you do not check that box, you will not be able to allow them to move forward in the application itself.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I don't know if that answers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, it does suit me because that's what I'm saying, that we're writing in here a rule to say that, you know, the director won't issue that license if that boxes in checked. Well, you can't even get to that point on the on the system if that box is in check.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I mean, the system itself is the de facto rule. So it's just a strange it's a strange rule. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Any other comments on the motion to amend? You. I will simply add this this this reminds me, I remember when we were going through the budget cycle last time and we had $1.5 million allotted to the Department of Safety and the Department of Safety told us they were going to use that money for'",
        "'speaker_1': 'additional police officers. Yeah, this council had a debate to make them put that. And had we done that, we only would have had 45 officers hired this year. We had a robust discussion and we realized we needed more and we had 85.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I don't think it's wise to put this in those rules if we already know that the excise analysis is moving forward. So let's vote on the motion to amend. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'FLYNN Hi. GILMORE No. Can each. No. Lopez I knew. Ortega I. Susman No. Black No. Brooks. No. Clark? Espinosa. No. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Madam Secretary, please close. Very nice results.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Five, six, seven, eight.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five, eight, seven days. The motion to amend has been denied. All right, we've got our next motion. Councilman Espinosa, would you like to do with this bill?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would like to amend my script. Sorry. I would like to move that. This the. Well, actually, no, Mr. President, I would like to move to amend Council Bill 16 0262 as follows on page two, line 30, after the word, a new insert the following.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Upon granting a license to an applicant who does not own the property where the licensed premises is located, the director shall deliver written notification to the owner of the property, advising the owner that a license has been issued.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. It has been moved. Colleagues, we need a second. It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So this is hopefully more straightforward but maybe is unnecessary, as is the prior. But I just. There is another attached attestation attestation on that form that basically says that yeah. Even though I don't own the property and renting the property, my owner is cool with me owning this mean renting out this thing short term and that's pretty'",
        "'speaker_12': 'much the extent of that. And also I want is this is the director they're going to have the license mean they're the owner information because that's also part of it too simply after that license has been issued to that individual who's already attested to all those things, is it being okay?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Is this and notification to the actual property owner saying, hey, this property has been issued a license for short term renting? It's it's it seems pretty straightforward to me, an easy ask and a good safeguard to property owners citywide.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's the purpose of this bill in this amendment. Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is in the script, it says it's an amendment to Council Bill 261. Is that a typo?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It is a typo was 262.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is 262. Thank you very much. I have I have similar problems with this particular requirement, and not the least of which is the amount of work and cost to discover the landlords of every single property, that of every single person who applies and would like to ask to excise and license.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What would this mean to excise and license to have to be able to discover and find and notify a landlord.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yeah. So I think the department said Councilman Espinosa's concern of making sure that an applicant has permission from their landlord to offer to short term rental. We've actually already included that provision within the ordinance language itself. So under the application section subsection G, it says that the applicant must provide written documentation from the property owner, allowing short'",
        "'speaker_14': 'term rentals on the licensed premises. And what that means is that gives the department authority to audit and do spot checks of the licenses at any time. So through complaints or through simple auditing or spot checks, we can ask for that written permission at any time we want during our licensing enforcement procedures.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In addition, I think there would be some concern about sort of the administrative burden of what that would mean to the department in terms of notifying property owners. Is the property owner a property management company? Where is that property management company located?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Is the property owner under an LLC that's under different people and some people may not. So it's there are some concerns that we would have about tracking the property owners that are associated with the licenses. I think the tools that we have in place now are sufficient for us to request that written permission from the licensee at'",
        "'speaker_14': 'any time. And it really puts the onus on the licensee to obtain that permission from their property owner and show it to the department any time it requested.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, thank you. Would it have the same effect? We wouldn't be enforcing the landlord tenant relationship. Maybe this is a question for the attorney. Would it have the same effect as the H-2A proposal? Was that it? We wouldn't be enforcing a landlord tenant relationship either.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I think there would be some of the same concerns. There's also concern that this would happen after we've granted that license. So, again, that property right in the license attaches to the licensee and we would have to go through due process to revoke a license if we found out that they didn't have permission.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So again, we're kind of getting involved with private contractual matters.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. Nathan was another question. Would this be a more complex process? One of the big things we're trying to do is make compliance 100% with this, make it more complicated for the applicant that we might discourage people from becoming regulated.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, I think the the best practices that we've seen around the nation point us toward having a licensing system that is not overly onerous, that can have a high rate of compliance. The way we're trying to achieve that is through an online licensing structure that would allow people to simply apply online instead of having to come in'",
        "'speaker_14': 'person. I think there would be concerns that that compliance rate might sink as soon as we're having to review contracts or leases in person. So a streamlined regulatory framework that we have now with an online system. Our hope is to achieve that high rate of compliance and through auditing and spot checks and other enforcement tools.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We can request that information whenever we'd like.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. And I, I attribute a rise in consciousness about these. I know many people who have done staffers felt like they didn't know that it was illegal, but actually got an input from one of my constituents who said, not after two years.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'People should be quite aware that this is an illegal operation and they should be. And we've had some wonderful press and information in the papers and things that landlords should know that this thing is possible. And of course we will have the education process for landlords and houses and others once it's if if in fact it passes'",
        "'speaker_5': '. And so, again, I'm not sure that it is a necessary process. It might discourage people from applying if they have to have extra steps to come down there and the landlords. One of the biggest things about the rules that we're having is that a successful applicant must list his license number in every advertising.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is a good tool for landlords and homes because they can go on every kind of site. We don't even have to decide whether it's Airbnb or VRBO, VR, Bio or Craigslist or, you know, mom's mom's list. You can see the advertising, and if the license isn't there, then you have a way to enforce it, not just'",
        "'speaker_5': 'by the city, but by landlords and by who is.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Sussman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thanks, Mr. President. And a question for Councilwoman Espinosa, because I'm a little confused. I thought I heard you vote no on my amendment for the very reason that Councilwoman Sussman and I and others are speaking against your amendment now.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Would what would happen if a landlord who, upon getting your notice, says, wait a minute, I didn't give permission and contacts? The station says, you know, you got to do something about this. I did not give permission. And so how is this different?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And and how would that work, in your view?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Actually, I'm glad you asked me that question, because right here is my next question to Nathan was to explain, does the owner have a trump card so that if an owner has a renter that is doing this, do they have the right to say, look, I own the property and I want to cease this or now we're'",
        "'speaker_12': 'kicking it back over into the civil side and saying, nope, you got to deal with that with your renter.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If a if a licensee cannot demonstrate that they have proof or permission from their property owner, then we will take action on the license.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But is the owner being there saying, I want this to cease enough.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So our inspectors can actually work with those owners and have the conversations with the property owners? Absolutely. So if we get a complaint from a property owner, then we can investigate accordingly. And depending on that case, depending on that investigation, if our inspectors feel that the licensee actually did not have permission from the property owner, we will'",
        "'speaker_14': 'take action on the license.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. It's not as once again, not as straightforward as I would hope. It's a process. Whereas I think as a person who rightfully owns the property, all parties, however many there are, should be able to go down there and say, pull the you know, cancel this license.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'At least there's a process for it.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. That partially answers that. I'm having trouble seeing the difference between your amendment and mine and in terms of how it operates in the end and works. So I'm struggling with that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn coming from knows I'm going to have over you to get to some people have chimed in yet councilman Lopez comments on the comments or questions on your on the motion on the floor.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President, I. Somewhere. I think I became a little confused here. Is it either you, Nathan? It's probably for you. Isn't it already illegal? For if it's I mean, I know we've been talking and know this is going into the substance of what the hearing will be about and the whole conversation of primary residents'",
        "'speaker_2': 'versus non. If we're asking in the bill if the whole fine I mean, we're not fine. But we've been having a lengthy conversation, hearing from people about the issue of owner occupied residences. Wouldn't it make that illegal? If you could only do it in owner occupied residences, wouldn't you as a renter be operating illegally?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So a long term tenant under the current framework, a long term tenant could still operate a short term rental as a primary residence.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. That's where I'm a little confused. All right. All right. Oh, that. Okay. That changes some things for me. Thank you. I wanted to make sure I was clear with that. All right. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'll start by saying I do think that this one is messier than the one we just had. And my biggest concern is with the cost of finding the owner mailing something to them. But I just I had to chime in because to argue that this makes it harder and discourages people to do something'",
        "'speaker_2': ', the requirement that's in there is for them to work with their landlord, get something in writing, showing permission and produce that. This this language is only one sentence long. Upon granting a license to an applicant who does not own the property, whereas the licensed premises located the director shall deliver written notice to the owner advising the owner'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that license has been issued. Nowhere in there does it say that the applicant has to do anything. If you really if you're going to make the argument that ease and compliance, you should strike the other part and put this one in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I think that everybody is positioning themselves for what they want and don't want in here. But let's be a little less disingenuous about what we argue on both sides of the table here. I do think there are legitimate concerns outside of that, but I do not think there's any valid argument to say that this makes it'",
        "'speaker_2': 'harder and will lead to less compliance because there's zero in this that the applicant is required to do. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman knew I was reading.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Gee, again, you know, says that, you know, that you're going to receive written documentation for the property owner. So go to for them to do it right. Are you are you going to at least are you going to check need that that that is the right property owner.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yeah. So through our inspection services, we can use the many tools that are available to the city to make sure that it is the identifiable property owner and make sure that we able to reach out to that property owner and and have those discussions if they have that, that authorization or not.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And we can do this, the auditing and the spot checks of the licenses, whether it be complaint based, whether it be spot checks at any time in that license, you will have to provide that that written documentation to the department of that permission and the written permission from the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so this is the property the listed property owner differs from what the documentation says and that license will not be processed until that's clarified.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right. It would be sort of a case by case instance on an investigation of that particular issue. The way we have it set up now is that you will apply online for your license. You'll certify that you have permission from your property owner to do this.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Once you go through the online steps and certification process, you'll then be issued a license number that then start advertising on your listings. Then it will be up to the department to go through those listings and check for compliance and do those spot check audits.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Are you going.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To check for the property owner before or after you issue the license?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So in the online license application, we won't be able to have a document like a lease or a separate document uploaded into that system. It will be entirely audit based.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, I just have concerns about enforcement making sure that they see the sales very good what you're doing. But if you don't check to see if that's the correct property owner, I just wonder if that's really that sound or a private practice.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You and I think, you know, once this this license rolls out, we'll be making fine tunes and adjustments to our enforcement. A lot of that is actually through our short term role advisory committee that can include department heads, hosts, non hosts, different agencies to really see how we're doing, to really make sure that our enforcement mechanisms get'",
        "'speaker_14': 'honed and sharpened over time. So we really feel that having a community based dialog through our advisory committee on our enforcement efforts is actually really important to the actual licensing scheme itself.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I should encourage you to keep it as tight as possible. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. You all right? Round two comments. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So I agree with you, Councilman Clark. It is actually really simple and probably would be cleaner my way rather than the way it is actually the. Because the fact of the matter is, is there is no extra step for the applicant.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's actually very easy. The assessor's office is right below you guys and there's excise and licensing and CPD. You'll have the address of the license location. You go to that record which we all have access to on the computer and you get the owner's information and then you put whatever the cost is, $0.42 or so used to'",
        "'speaker_12': 'those forever stamps. You stamp that on an envelope with the notification saying your license, your property has been issued a license for a short term rental to the following individual. It couldn't get any better than that, and that's a degree of assurance that I think we should offer.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Those people that own properties where the long term renter is short term renting. And just so we don't think that this is a huge grave thing. We have approximately 2000 stores in this city and only a fraction, a very small fraction of those are being short term rented by long term renters.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So we're not talking about all 2000. We're just talking about that small fraction that are acknowledging that they do not own the property that they that they call their primary residence, but they are short term renting. And so but I do have a question for the anybody here.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Do we what is what is the percentage of those 2000 that are renters re renting their property versus non primary resident operators.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You know, I currently don't have that information right now, but once we start licensing, once we actually start giving us the ability to collect data on our licenses and the number of licenses we've issued, we'll be able to work off some figures and some numbers for you.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And as I mentioned earlier, our advisory committee can actually study that those numbers and study that data to see what the issues may be, to see what our rate of compliance is, to see how well our administration enforcement of our license has gone.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So it's probably some numbers we don't have today, but with the licensing structure, we'll be able to have those numbers.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if I just said roughly 10% and I'm pulling numbers that are not fair, but 10% of the number of the 2000 are re renters. You know, long term renters doing short term rentals. That would be 200 of these properties.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I can tell you that I've probably got well over 200 letters basically asking me to to get rid of the primary residency requirement. So if we're looking for 100% compliance or as close to it, we should we should this this rule, should it mean these laws should actually be capturing the industry?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Not not. What my concern is, is that, yes, we got I.N.S. Compliance and we got a lot of compliance with the notion that I presented to Councilwoman Sussman when she went to the agency at Denver Water while I was on the campaign trail in 2014 that this should be for primary residences only.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so. So the. The the. My frustration is we're we're moving forward on this bill with that clause. And we're not thinking about all the other periphery things that actually could make this bill good from an enforcement side.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And those are comments. But it's troublesome that we can't provide this one little safeguard reassurance that property owners will be notified when we know how to contact property owners for a whole host of reasons. And this is not a very big ask.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you know, the councilwoman Sussman, you back up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I thanks everybody for their comments. But I do want to clear up what Councilman Clark and Councilman Espinosa said, that it wouldn't make more work for the applicant. And I believe that when we had conversations about this, you worry that it would require the applicant to come down to the Webb Building to show some sort of affidavit'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Can you address that? Have you figured out since we last talked that they wouldn't?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll give Nathan a little rest as Stacey likes the director of Excise and Licenses, just to be concerned when this is over. We're just now seeing the languages.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'One of the concerns.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is if you have to test, you have to give an.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Address.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'For the landlord to be able to move.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'On to one of our concerns. If we just went to the assessor's office as we'd be mailing that letter to the same renter who just applied for the license and it won't actually necessarily get to the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we'd have to create additional.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Steps in our licensing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Process of providing who the landlord is.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'If it's an LLC, if it's not a real person in the contact information, and that would be information that we may not be able to do online anymore. When we kind of build out those steps, we lose some of that simplicity of being able to do the online ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And it's just one of the things we don't really been able to flesh out, and it helps to see the language itself, but that is absolutely one of our concerns of it might be that tipping point of what we can do online versus not online.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to let you all know that there was some thought that it might require a trip downtown. You'll recall our issues about trying to find the owners of marijuana stores and their LLC and partnerships and trying to find an owner is is not as easy.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we might have to have the applicant themselves do that work and come and show us what that means. I also want to say that we've worked pretty hard on this bill, and while we may have missed some things, you know, I think that we have looked at many, many of these things that people are amending or'",
        "'speaker_5': 'trying to amend at the last minute. So and I trust that going forward, we will have a good eyes, good eyes on the process. So just have the same concern that this is sort of a last minute thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you can see that we're sort of doing all the committee work here on the night of the first reading.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Sussman and Councilman the clerk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify. So the assessor's office does not provide an address for the owner of the property.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Those.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Well, the property's mailing address will be the property itself. That may not be where the owner themselves.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Lives, but a property owner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Forwarding mail.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Address. So if you think of a property company, you know, four poets wrote the you know, the management company doesn't necessarily have a mailing address on file, but it's one of the things we've.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Got a property owner who is concerned about getting notifications about their property can tell the assessor, I own this property, I live there and we do record the address of the property owner. It may not be required, but the assessor's office has the address for the owner.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The mailing address for the owner is currently located.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That. Like I said, this is this is a really new kind of thing for us to trying to flesh out. And those are just.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Questions that we have to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, because, again, I don't think that I don't interpret this as us happening to you. And maybe that maybe that is a problem with how it's written, that we have to go to extraordinary lengths to find the owner.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I do know that you can call up any county assessor unless Denver is different from our sister counties and say, I own this property, I don't live there. Here's my address. And then notifications like weeds on your property, things that can be assessed against the property will be mailed to the owner in addition to the renter.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's already a function of our assessor's office. And so maybe the wording needs to be specific about we will mail it to the property owner of record in the assessor's office. I think we I'm assuming that's what we're doing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If that's not clear, then we could clear that up and then it would add zero additional searching. We just go to the assessor and we send it there. And if you're a property owner who doesn't want to put your address there, then you're not going to get the one about the weeds and you're not going to get'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the one about this. That's your choice. But we're notifying you in the way that you want to get notified as no additional work. And I think Councilman Espinosa brings up a good thing, which talks to my concern about the cost of this, that even if all 2000 of them were renters and we're paying a 50 cent stamp'",
        "'speaker_2': 'plus the mailing, you know, we're not breaking the bank to send this thing. And I do think that it provides a worthwhile addition to the thing to the bill. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. I just want to apologize to the audience and to my colleagues. I did, in fact, bring this up in a 1 to 1 briefing. And I brought it up in multiple committee meetings. And, you know, it was never entertained.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so that's why I'm doing what I can do as a councilperson to bring out the language directly for a vote. The you know, and I'm happy to amend the language if we think there's a simpler way. But that's exactly what I'm getting at, which is we have records of some sort and we tax these individuals from'",
        "'speaker_12': 'their property that they own. We should be able to connect these dots fairly easily. And and unfortunately, for some reason, in an effort to simplify the licensing process, we keep trying to downplay the sort of enforcement side. And and and this is a straightforward, direct concern because I've seen this already happen with owners of properties.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'They they find out that when they go to their property, it's not who they thought they were renting to. And and that is not that's that shouldn't happen when we have when it's so easy to actually correct.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Think you know that. All right. Any other comments on the second motion to amend.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'This is my name.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is not Councilman Flynn. You got a comment?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Yes, maybe I was clicking on the wrong thing. I'd like a little bit of clarification on an answer to the question that Councilwoman Sussman asked about, about an applicant being required to come down to the Webb building. That kind of went over my head because the only requirement in this amendment is for you to do something the'",
        "'speaker_13': 'applicant. This doesn't change any of the requirements for the applicant to attest that he or she has the permission of the property owner. What did I miss there? Would someone would an applicant have to come down to City Hall or to Webb Building?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And then the other thing, while somebody is thinking of the answer is Councilman Clark is is correct that the assessor does list. I'm looking at a house right down the street from my own that is a rental. And the owner's address down in South Jefferson County is listed as the as the point of contact.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So the assessor does list the addresses of the of the absentee owners. Not always is it clear if it's a natural person or not, but as long as we mail it to the same place, we send the tax bills, I assume, where they're paying our property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'So they ought to be able to get this notice. But could you clarify the answer about someone coming down because of having to come down because of this? I don't understand that. Or maybe Councilwoman Sussman can.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Help me on. But they were the ones that told me that it might have to happen.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think it was. It's more of that. The goal of the department. Right. So the goal of the department is to make sure we have a regulatory framework that allows us to preserve an online license. Right. That's a really that's a really strong principle that we like to see move forward within this actual ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So if there are as soon as there are complexities that come forward with reviewing applications in person, that's where we would have some concern. So as long as the regulatory framework itself gives us the the ability to still do that online license, that's really what we're as a department trying to keep.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And how does this change that? Does this amendment change that?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think I would have to read the amendment language a little further. As I understand it, it's after the license is issued.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Upon granting, you've already granted the license to the applicant, so he or she has already done what they need to do. All online, all you have to do or Stacy Schmidt delegated to you is to mail that mail that letter to that address.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right. And I think it'll just be a question of making sure we can keep track of the property owners. And we've discussed the assessor is but keeping track of the property management companies, keeping track of the losses. How frequently is that assessor's website updated?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Just the department impact of making sure that we're giving the correct notice and the correct notice. The correct property owner is something that we need to determine on our own.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'All right. Thank you. This sounds like more of a morass than mine was about Councilman Espinosa. I'll vote for it anyway.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Any other comments on the motion to amend that? I was a councilman. Espinosa, you back up again.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'If, like, I don't know. I mean, I would be willing to amend that language to direct it towards the the the license, the primary contact on the assessor's office, not the mailing address, but the the contact. If that simplifies the management of this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You know, I'm looking to Dave, what can we vote on this motion? And then if there's a if there's a wording issue, I think we can get the intent out correctly. I mean, the lawyers can do that if people understand what the intent is or do we need to wordsmith right now, I feel as if we've had'",
        "'speaker_1': 'this issue before when we were talking as like we we had we voted on an amendment and we made sure that the lawyers were going to be able to flesh it out correctly. So that would be properly understanding.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I in my off base.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'David or the good news is we have time.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Well, you well, you're a little off base. We tend to do that in committee, but not on the floor. This is going to be incorporated in the published version of the bill. You need to get the language and I hate to say this, but if if Council Councilman Espinosa wants to withdraw it and propose something else right'",
        "'speaker_13': 'now, or if it can be further amended on second reading, that's a possibility as well. But but we don't do conceptual amendments on the floor. We haven't historically.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay, so let's move. Let's keep the language as is. And if there's a better way of of defining address, I'm happy to entertain that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, any other comments on to 62? I will just add, I think that for a very small percent, I wonder if the amount of brain damage that we're putting into this. And I just I'm just joking with that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But for that small amount, I'm not sure if that's worth it to get what we want to get out of it. So I might think there might be a better way we can do this. And I will say, as a property owner, when I bought my house in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, I moved twice.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mean not one time did I ever contact the City of London to say that I had moved twice. And so maybe I'm just a bad property owner because I know they didn't know where I live. So maybe they tracked me down and I was unaware, but I didn't realize.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just think we're not getting to where we want to and where this motion is written. Madam Secretary, voting on a vote on the motion to amend. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'ESPINOSA Hi, Flynn. Gilmore No carnage. Lopez No new Ortega I. SUSMAN No. BLACK No. BROOKS No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'CLARK All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You're good. You've got it, I. You're good. Okay. Madam Secretary, please close the voting out. The results.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Five six, seven, 857.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The motion to amend has been defeated. All right. So we still have our regular bill to 62, which is ordered published. Now, council members, before we get in the comments, I just want to remind you this is on first publication.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There will be a robust time to comment in depth at the public hearing on June 13th should it pass. But I don't want to discourage anyone from commenting. I just wanted to remind you of that. Councilman, new Europe up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Nader. Stacy, the one just to want to talk a little bit about enforcement and a little bit and right now, that's a process, right? That's illegal in the suit. It's been going on for quite a while. And what can you describe a little bit of what you're doing now to enforce the law and this is versus'",
        "'speaker_2': 'what you'll be able to do with this new bill?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That's a great question. The current enforcement resource criminals can typically be onerous and difficult through neighborhood inspection services, and I don't know if anyone from CPD may be able to comment that or not, but typically what you will see is it's a complaint based.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Someone will call 311 Neighborhood Inspection Services, an inspector will come out to the property. They'll investigate accordingly. They'll knock on the door. Someone will need to answer the door. They'll interview the person who answers the door and try and determine if they're doing a short term rental or not.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'They can then issue violations and citations and then the person can actually take that and appeal it to the board of adjustment of whether or not they've actually been doing a short term rental. So I think the current framework, the current options are lengthy, timely and onerous.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'With a licensing framework, we can actually make it much more streamlined and efficient. When we talk about two rules, we were talking about force and really talking about two different rules of enforcement. There's the enforcement of the sort of what we call common neighborhood complaints, and that may be noise, trash, parties, parking, etc. That's addressed with our'",
        "'speaker_14': 'existing tools that we have today through and I asked through DPD, through Environmental Health as a department, we plan on actually partnering with those departments to track those complaints on our licensees. Our licensing enforcement world will live within our own internal inspectors.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We plan on actually creating a separate division within our excise and licenses inspectors. So the short term rental enforcement division that will include dedicated existing inspectors, where there are priorities throughout the work day, is to actually enforce the requirements of our licensing ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'That will include inspectors scanning through websites to make sure people are compliant with the license number, doing spot checks of making sure people have permission from their property owners, doing other audits to make sure that people are complying with the safety features of our of our ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So it's really a joint effort between excise and licenses. Nice 311 and all of the other agencies involved to make sure that we can track and monitor the compliance within our processes as well. This is sort of a unique situation for us because we have a license that will bring forth a short term rental advisory committee and'",
        "'speaker_14': 'again, we'll have a community based dialog of how that enforcement is working. So the advisory committee will include hosts, non hosts, city agencies representing city council, other outside experts, and we'll be able to monitor the data that are coming in with respect to complaints and enforcement and be able to alter our framework accordingly through the work of'",
        "'speaker_14': 'the advisory committee. So this is certainly a working process. It's a it's a tool that we hope to continue to hone and sharpen over time. But really with the licensing component, we'll have much more tools at our disposal to revoke the privilege to operate a short term rental.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sounds like a lot more work, especially is not really being performed now. Right. And in sort of unregulated environment and the new work that you're going to have to be doing, how many more additional staff are you going to have to do this work?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Right now, we're really relying on the existing inspectors. So it'll be a dedicated set of inspectors that will enforce the short term rental ordinance. Again, through our advisory committee, we'll be able to look to them for a recommendation of whether or not our staffing needs to increase and whether or not those staffing needs are on the excise'",
        "'speaker_14': 'and licenses side of the enforcement or on the neighborhood inspection services. But what we're really trying to do is have data driven enforcement, data driven policies. And the more that we can collect the data and collect information that will help guide the department on where those extra resources might be needed in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, it sounds a little unrealistic to think that your existing staff's going to try to do all this work that's not being performed. Well, I surely encourage you to ask for the staff that you need to get this done right and start off on the right foot.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The advisory board committee will do a great job helping to monitor it. But if you start off with too few people and. You're going to have problems in the neighborhood. You're going to have a bigger issues. I think you ought to reconsider about whether your existing staff can actually perform all these responsibilities and duties force.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's a big, big issue with the neighborhoods. I've heard it over and over again. So I really encourage you to rethink what you're doing and and hope that you ask for additional staff to not only do the work, but also do it seven days a week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There needs to be some responsibilities on the weekends, too, if there's some kind of enforcement issue, too. And know I don't I'm not sure it's just an in-house issue. Maybe I think it's going to be your inspectors as well.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I believe just with the weekend and evenings, there's there's tools in place now to address complaints for any residential property in Denver on the weekends or in the evenings. So the Denver Police Department is available at any time during the weekend.'",
        "'speaker_14': '311 is also available extended hours. And what our plan is to monitor and track and work with our partner agencies to look at the complaints that came in, to review those complaints and take action on the licenses if those complaints are significant enough to go to the action.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, I just don't want us to waste a lot of police manpower, you know, when they should be doing other things, when this really responsibility should be yours. Obviously, there are situations of of of incidents at properties where they'll have to be involved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I sure encourage your staff to pick up the load there and help enforce this ordinance, right?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Absolutely. And again, the department can come back with more budget request in if future time. What we're really looking to do is collect that data and collect the information to give our department an informed decision of what those those staffing needs might be in the future.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'What we need to do to alter our existing framework.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'One last question. There will be a clear differentiation about what your inspectors will do and what you and I will do. Right. That will be really clear for the public to understand then, right?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Correct. So the the the short term rental enforcement division will be doing enforcement on the actual ordinance language itself. At the same time, we'll be partnering with an IRS to look at the complaints that they've received and vice versa.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So both the text amendment and the licensing ordinance, do you have the primary residency restrictions to them? We envision joint partnerships between an IRS and excise and licenses to enforce the same regulation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think I still encourage you to make sure you have enough staff to get this job done right the first time. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman new councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. Mr. President, might I ask you a procedural question that I don't see addressed in our rules in four weeks, assuming that we postpone final on this 1 to 62 or you have torn to 62? Can the speakers on 261 also address you as part of the public hearing as a courtesy address?'",
        "'speaker_13': 'The subject matter of the licensing provisions is I can't find anything in the rules about combining hearings on two bills at the same time so that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, of course. And that's one of the reasons why I'm going to postpone it. We don't have to have a public hearing on a licensing bill, but we will be having both these bills come up the first night.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I will welcome comment on either one of them.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Thank you. Just that's why I wanted to clarify that our rules do allow speakers to address only the licensing aspect, even though the hearing is on the zoning bill. Is that that will be permitted. Yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then Councilor Flynn. Any other comments on 262? Come. Katherine Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Closing comments or questions?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'These are these are comments to 62 as without any of the two motions. So as now it's on the floor for publication and comments or questions.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So so this is my prepared statement, part of it anyway. This is a matter that impacts all residentially zoned districts. Means residentially zoned properties citywide and directly impacting neighborhoods, individuals and families, be they Denver residents or visiting star guests.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I believe rulemaking should follow a vote of the people of Denver.

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa in the comments to 62. I will say I'm going to vote to move this today and as well as the postponement. But I do think we can get smarter with this bill. I appreciate Councilwoman Sussman leadership on this to take this two years ago and to be very thoughtful and a lot of hearing'",
        "'speaker_1': 'from different people with different interest. But I think we can do better at that. And I hope over the next month, as we move this to the June 13th hearing, we can find a way to tweak this a little bit that I think will allow us to be do better, a better job of regulators.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Accountable to 62 is, of course, a companion bill. The council bills to 61, which will have a required public hearing on June 13th. So in order to move the two bills together and to allow comments on both, I would like to postpone final consideration of this license bill.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Council Bill 262 to Monday, June 13th.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right, let's get this on the floor. Councilman Lopez, will you please put 262 on the floor to be postponed?'",

        "'speaker_1': 'And you just want to note that 939 is series of 2015.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening to you, sir, with community planning and development. This is a rezoning of property located at 4800 North Ray Street. It is proposed to be reasoned from I.B., an industrial zone district you are to which is an overlay allowing billboards to seem x three, cm x five and c MSA which is urban center mixed use three'",
        "'speaker_6': ', five and eight story. So the property is located in central north central Denver in the Elyria Swansea neighborhood. Oops, I went the wrong way. And it is about 264,000 square feet or six acres. There is an existing warehouse, industrial warehouse on the property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The property owner is requesting to rezone to redevelop the site. And again, the request is to go from I.B., which is an industrial zone district use overlay to which allows which creates an allowance for billboards to urban center mixed use three stories, five stories and eight stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So as I said before, it's in the Elyria Swansea, a neighborhood three blocks east of Brighton Boulevard and the National Western Transit Station that will be built two blocks north of Interstate 70. And two blocks west of York Street.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Current zoning is that industrial zone zoning. Current use is an industrial use. It is a 1 to 2 storey industrial warehouse that is within a half mile of the National Western Stock Show and Transit Station. So existing context, the zoning is surrounded on the north by that industrial zone district, a city park to the west, and a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'recreational recreation center, and then two unit zoning to the south predominantly. So again, existing industrial land use mostly to the north and residential to the south across 48th Avenue. This gives you an idea of what the property looks like.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is a huge warehouse at this point. Bottom picture is the residential to the south. Picture on the right is the Park City Park. And then the industrial land uses. So this was that planning board on March 16th and was recommended unanimously to support the rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It was a neighborhood plan and planning committee on April 6th and passed out of committee then. So we are here for the public hearing that has been properly noticed. These are all of the RINO's that were notified of this hearing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have no R.A. letters, but one letter of opposition that should be in your packet. The last page of your packet. So the plans that apply our plan 2000 Blueprint Denver and the Illyria Sponsor Your Neighborhoods Plan that was adopted in 2015.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Blueprint Denver Land use concept is transit oriented development because of the proximity to the station. It is within that half mile, if I hadn't said that before. And our transit oriented development in Blueprint Denver should be a balanced mix of uses and mid to high density development.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And of course, it's an area of change where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Citywide.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want to direct growth. So the Elyria Swansea Neighborhoods Plan did amend areas of change, but not for this property. So it is remains in an area of change. It is remains in the transit oriented development land use type in the Elyria Swansea, a plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it does give us more direction on the heights of the development on the property. You'll notice it is three, five and eight stories, the same as being proposed. So this diagram gives you a little bit of information on how we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Drew the lines of where the three, five and eight story should occur. Basically, we tried to treat the property as if it were next door to a protected zone district, because that's the gist of what the Elyria Swansea plan wanted us to do.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Step down to the existing residential on the south side of 48th Avenue. So we started at the front property line as if it were directly adjacent to a protected zone district. We went back the 25 feet. That would be a step back in if it were a protected district and then up the three stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Then we went for a 175 feet back from the line. That is the actual boundary between the protected zone district and the property. And that's another standard in the zoning code that within 175 feet of a protected zone district, you can't be higher than a certain height.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we use that horizontal distance as the five story height, and then the remainder of the property is the eight storey height. So with that, staff finds that this application is consistent with the applicable neighborhood plans and that we will further the uniformity of district regulations by sticking with our regular zoned districts.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And we are, by implementing our plans, furthering the public's health, safety and welfare, justifying circumstances changed conditions. The property will be redeveloping with a new owner. It is located in an area of change within half mile of a trans, a new transit station and the redeveloping National Western Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The local plan does call for it to rezone or redevelop from industrial to transit oriented development, industrial mixed use and then still accommodate the industrial in the neighborhood. So we believe this is a correct justifying circumstance. And with that, staff recommends approval.'",

The neighborhood leaders have called for additional rooftops in the neighborhoods. For as long as I can remember, the CMC's 358 is in line with our neighborhood plans, although a slight detail'",
        "'speaker_11': 'is that there is a little asterisks next to that and that. Asterix When we were in the steering committee for the Illyria Swansea, a plan was saying that community needed to be involved in that process of the rezone.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I think that's the sort of sticking point is that we, the community would like to be involved and have some set of commitments to to continue to be involved during the whole process of this property. This it's important to point out that globally responsive are our affordable neighborhoods, not affordable housing neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'These neighborhoods have been traditionally affordable. So affordable housing doesn't necessarily meet the same qualifications as what we need for our neighbors that are being displaced. They may not qualify for under affordable housing terms. So that's something to really keep in mind.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Also, the I know some other people are going to speak about this as well, but this is going from 150 housing units that are currently in Illyria to potentially 550 units, which is quadrupling, almost quadrupling the amount of housing in this one little neighborhood of Illyria.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So this is a huge, huge impact to this neighborhood. There's also a bunch of infrastructure issues. You know, you guys have heard about the sewer pipeline. Also, there's no sidewalks on 48th or 49th. There's no pedestrian bridge on 47th in York, which is how these children would get to elementary school if they lived here.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's no the street the 49th street doesn't go all the way through, which is supposed to be in the two C funds funded. So we're looking for a set of commitments. We've talked to Tony about it, hoping to meet more about that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But that involves community residents being involved in the actual decision making process, including choosing who this developer is. We would like a percentage of the units to be under community control. We'd like every resident of 150 homes in Elyria to be informed about every stage of decision making during this process.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's only 150 homes. It's not that hard to talk to everyone, and there should be entry points into the process. We overall just displacement is very real right now and globally response. Yeah, it's happening every day and when you hear about a rezoning, sometimes it can escalate those feelings when we don't have guarantees from the city that'",

We have people who, like Noela said our neighborhood has been affordable, so we have people who want to buy and people who want to rent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we need to maintain a continuum of options that are affordable for neighbors in the community. But above all, we need to make sure that the neighbors currently in the community are the priority for this development. Right now, with all of the developments, they should be on list.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We should be tracking them. We should be making sure that they get a first crack at the options that are becoming available. This project, in short, is in alignment with the neighborhood plan that was approved in 2015. We'd like the set of commitments that neighborhood neighbors are the first priority.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Community wants to be involved in all decision making, and we want community control over this land trust. So that's all I have to say. And I hope you guys will support this time.'",

        "'speaker_0': '. And then I think it was at the neighborhood planning meeting, it was mentioned, I think by Urban Land Institute excuse me, Urban Land Conservancy, that that was no longer a part of it. And I want us to understand from the beginning what is the fiduciary structure of this?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want us to make sure that the dots or the dots are connected around what the benefits to the community are relative to the overall integration of the neighborhood plans, the National Western Center push, the transit oriented development.'",

        "'speaker_12': 'apartment buildings. I support this project because I think in principle for us, for that transit station to be effective and viable, we need density around that station, the station where, you know, to require investment. I think that's a that's something that is very good and I support in principle that but I, I wanted to talk about the'",
        "'speaker_12': 'density of this project. 400 units on six acres is is roughly 67 units per acre. Just by way of comparison, the density of Manhattan, which is the most concentrated urban area in the United States, is 105 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But that was built up over 250 years. They have parks, they have subways, they have an infrastructure. It's a modern urban center. And we're I guess some of my concern is that we're going to do this well, not instantly, but over two or three years.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think we have to do it intelligently and sensitively and with community involvement. And just so regarding the process, I was at two of the three meetings. I don't remember density or building heights, eight stories being discussed. We discussed eight storeys during the neighborhood plan, but I don't remember that really being discussed at the three community meetings'",
        "'speaker_12': '. But I do want to just say that that the the affordable component of this project is absolutely essential. It's my understanding it's 50% affordable that that's that's that's essential to be part of it. And also to underscore NOLA and Candy's point, community involvement going forward is absolutely necessary, including in the choice of the developer.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And this is is essential to guarantee the city's use of it's the city that the city funds are being used for this. So we have to you have an obligation to include the neighborhood in those discussions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dutcher. Flossie O'Leary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. I'm Flossie O'Leary. I'm a resident of Sunnyside, but I'm here tonight representing a clinic at their back where a federally qualified health center that serves patients throughout the metro Denver area but happened to be located in Globeville and provide behavioral health or mental health services and health education.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Illyria, about two blocks from this facility. I wanted to start with a little bit of a context that I think is helpful. First of all, I attended like and Elizabeth did some of those community meetings last summer where a smaller number of Elyria residents engaged in design and creativity, including children, which was fabulous.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think that's important. And I want to echo what my colleagues have said, what we need more of that. In fact, a couple of the nonprofits and agencies, including and DCC, have been talking about kind of building on the health impact assessment that was really spearheaded by former Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we're going after funding to do that, to further engage the community members in what their perception of how they could be there and their families be healthy and thrive in the community. But those neighbors that participated last summer were really intuitively right on because what they were sharing in terms of services and opportunities they wanted are'",
        "'speaker_4': 'exactly what you see in health research and really what all of us in Denver have been able to see by the great success of the Mariposa Center. And that's when you mix jobs and transportation and training and health services and healthy food and opportunity, integrate with that park and connectivity to transportation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then families and individuals see their health and well-being improve. And we'd like to see more of that. And also the challenge of the accelerated level of displacement is something that can't be discounted, but others have spoken to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I would say the rationale for why I'm here supporting to 16 is that although it's not an immediate way of addressing the displacement, it is part of that long term solution. And those affordable units in an affordable community will help families that want to stay in that community, be able to stay and possibly even own.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think what you heard from the planning of the tiered approach is going to create almost like a buffer to some of the industry in the north and to the east. That really allows more integration. It gets closer to the residents and lower on the south side and creates almost like a safer, quieter campus community that then'",
        "'speaker_4': 'integrates with the residences and the park. And then lastly is the more that we can increase those multiple services and opportunities, the more likely we are to help improve the health and wellness of the community. So in closing, I just want to say thank you for the support that you have already provided in helping the ULC secure'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this location and to ask for your continued support in terms of the infrastructure, community engagement and just the approval of 216. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Now time for questions from members of council. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Teresa. And. Teresa, I'm going to ask you to I think I think it's page nine.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Of.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Of your in your slide deck.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Me get there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm just going to ask you to, you know, and the neighborhood plan, it calls for different heights. And we had this discussion within our our planning committee. And let me if you. Yeah. Go to the neighborhood plan where it shows the the different heights.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think you got to go down a couple more. And so, yeah, there it is. Perfect. So again, we know that plans help guide us, you know, use for guidance towards zoning. And I know my colleague would probably ask the question about this, but I wanted to kind of head this often.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'C and allow you to articulate based on this guidance in the plan how you came, how CPD came to work with. You see the applicant on the exact break up from the three to 5 to 8 step down because, you know, obviously in the plan, it looks like the lines are a little different.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But I wanted you to write. Go ahead and talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, so what we did was pay attention to the language of the plan that tells us to step down to the neighborhood and this guidance that tells us we are stepping down from eight stories to three stories. So that other illustration that I was talking about, we started as if we were directly adjacent to a protected district'",
        "'speaker_6': 'because that's what we were trying to do with the language of the plan was step down to the residential and protect the residential from the density of that eight stories. So we started with that and stepped up from there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. And in the plan it uses that the lines are a little greater. It would, it would almost seem like the plan is calling for the middle of the property to be stepped down and. Well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We didn't it's not a scale drawings. So if there were some measurements in the drawing that tell us the first 50 feet or the first 150 feet have to be three stories or five stories or eight stories. We would have worked with the Urban Land Conservancy to better fit the legal descriptions to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But given that it's an illustration and not a scale drawing, we just trying to use our best judgment and the standards that are already in the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you. I just wanted you to say it for the record. I appreciate it. Tony Pickett, can you. Tony, please describe the process that you went through with the neighborhood to incorporate some of the neighborhoods ideas into the vision of what this could be.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Sure, we actually convened a series of meetings last year, both large scale and some smaller, more intense workshops. We actually had workshops on two different days, different times, morning and evening, as was mentioned earlier. One of those work groups was Kids within the Neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We actually had those at facilities within the neighborhood, the Valds Perry Library, as well as the Colorado Miners Recreation Center there in the neighborhood. We actually did things like attended the Swansea Elementary Festival and solicited input from the attendees at that festival as well, and came up with a listing of things that were repeated as themes throughout'",
        "'speaker_14': 'the input that we received. Certainly affordable housing was one of those things. Things like commercial kitchens and health clinics and very typical things that you might hear in any neighborhood were things that people desired in terms of the input that we received.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We also participated in some of the Elyria, Swansea and Neighborhood Plan development meetings themselves, and actually this illustration was the subject of an evening, a meeting conversation about the distribution of heights across the site as well as the station area itself, the larger station area.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So you see that same variation in heights extending over toward the station as a result of that meeting. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, you've heard the concern of folks from the neighborhood. And I think, you know, and I've witnessed kind of the Holly area redevelopment that you guys have done, which was a very tense environment, but bringing the community together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But what really brought that together is that committee, that harp committee that helped guide their process. Are you willing to work in this neighborhood, develop a steering committee to work with the developer on some of the needs that they're looking at?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yes, we are. In fact, I think most of the speakers that you heard tonight, we had a recent meeting and we agreed to have them designate representatives for that very committee that you're describing in order to work with us throughout the selection and development process.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. And then, you know, I follow back up because this had come up but already questions. But I'll follow back up. I want to I want to say because I think Nola mentioned it, the gentrification conversation already will be having in the Business Development Committee Committee 10:30 a.m. on Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Next Tuesday. Just to let you all know.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thanks. Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilwoman Kenny.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, was going to ask Tony. You were very brief, you know, just offering questions, but you didn't really tell much of the story of the project. So now I'm kind of we certainly want to follow up on the questions we heard from the community.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So can you say a little more about the affordable housing? Someone mentioned a percentage. I didn't know if that was accurate. And if you could just update us a little bit on the affordability mix.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Sure. And just a little bit of the back story you will see was approached by the city's Office of Economic Development, understanding that there was a willing seller of this industrial property, which is within two blocks of the future station at the stock show.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And so it would be an opportunity for equitable transit oriented development. So once the negotiations about the purchase price were completed, it ended up that the city provided you will see a $1.5 million loan that we would at favorable terms that we would have to pay back over time.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But again, in combination with other financing that we were able to secure, we paid that $5.5 million purchase price for the six acre property as part of the city's loan requirements. We're required to provide 51%. You heard 50.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It's 51% of the units, the total units developed on the site as affordable housing at folks at less than 80% of area median income. And also, we were to provide 26 full time jobs as part of the buildout of the development, which will happen in multiple phases over multiple years.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I do want to be very clear. The 400 unit number that has been stated over and over again, it's really up to 400 units. That's our own internal preliminary concepts have determined that we could probably have up to 400 units.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But I can. To tell you that, as was mentioned earlier, the existing infrastructure throughout the neighborhood, beyond the boundaries of the site, the main sanitary sewer line that would connect over to York is inadequate to provide 400 new units on the site.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So we're beginning to have conversations with in DCC, OED and other city departments about the timing and providing some of those infrastructure improvements that we'll need in order to fully realize the potential of the site.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Tony. And if I may ask a question of Theresa drew, I appreciate he flagged this for me about six, eight months ago. We him and I talked on the phone about the question of infrastructure. You know, was there going to be a general development plan for this site?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And how is it that infrastructure happens after the zoning? So can you please share with us what kind of infrastructure planning? So we already know about the sanitary sewer, but the residents have good questions about the rest of the infrastructure to support the site, what kind of process will use, and whether that process involves public notice or'",
        "'speaker_11': 'meetings or as requirements or encouraged so that we kind of can all live here. Understanding what city processes continue, it's great to know there's a committee that's forming, but we want to understand the city process that will follow this.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, but I am not the infrastructure person, so I have limited knowledge of that. I do know there have been some discussions on roads. Typically when we're talking about roads, we're also talking about what's underneath the roads, which are the drainage systems and all of the other systems.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that's really the extent of my knowledge on this. I know that we have discussed. The roads. The infrastructure that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Sorry, I did not prepare you, that I was going to ask that question. So I'm sorry about that. Tony, do you have can you answer with a better. Yeah, sorry about that, Teresa. I didn't warn you. I was coming.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I believe it's just a matter of coordinating the timing of the improvements. In fact, again, the Elyria Swansea plan and the National Western Plan call for things like sidewalks and extending 49th Street through what is currently today the DPS bus, bar and site to actually reach the station from our site.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So there are a number of pedestrian and roadway improvements called for in the plan as well. What I've been hearing in the meetings that I've participated in is it's just just a matter of the timing of implementing those in coordination with everything else that has to happen around the stock show itself as far as its infrastructure improvement'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Can I just clarify, though, Tony, some of these pieces of infrastructure are on your site, so they would go within the purview of your development. It wouldn't be so much a question of when the city is putting sidewalks across the street.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It's it's about what kind of sidewalks you're putting in and what kind of lighting accompanies those sidewalks, whether, you know, there's interior open space or, you know, those kinds of questions are the ones that I'm referring to, things that are and this was Drew's call to me is typically these are things done in a general development plan'",
        "'speaker_11': '. We won't I it's my understanding this site does not meet the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And again we may need to go those in that case we would be looking at those kinds of things. When we are doing a site development plan, we typically ask developers to put in the sidewalks, to put in as much open space as we can get them to put in and those sorts of things all of course'",
        "'speaker_6': ', according to what the zoning code says we can require.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Great. I just I guess I would ask Tony whether or not you are committed to making sure that whatever committee you establish to talk about the some of the issues the residents raised in, Councilman Brooks asked about, you know, the culture of the community and the uses and those questions, whether that community can also be closely related'",
        "'speaker_11': 'involved in the conversation about infrastructure. Sure. You see that that committee has purview over both those areas.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We'd actually welcome that level of input.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. And we may just want to follow up a little more with public works. They they gave me a slightly different answer than you guys have about there's something between site planning and general development plans that that and actually it wasn't public works, it was CPD might have been someone else in CPD, but there is'",
        "'speaker_11': 'another infrastructure planning process that we've used. So I want to clarify if that's happening or not. We can do that after the meeting. But thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman each. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Tony, I have another question for you. So, first of all, I want to thank you, L.Z., for all of the great things you do, just for our purposes and for anyone who may be watching, can you just sort of lay out a general timeline, approximately, of when we might see something there and just'",
        "'speaker_10': 'summarize the steps it's going to take to get there just so people are realistic?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, let me say, the best thing I can do to illustrate that is to compare it to our development at the 40th in Colorado station on the 9.4 acre site that we purchased there in 2013, we actually had a grand opening for the first 156 units on that site, the first phase the day before the A-line opened'",
        "'speaker_14': 'in April. So it took nearly three years just to develop one phase. What we are anticipating here for race, if we can quickly get to some understanding about infrastructure, we would likely solicit for a vertical development partner. Around September, October of this year, have a very definite plan for phase one in place and be able to submit'",
        "'speaker_14': 'for low income housing tax credits for a first affordable residential phase next year. If we're lucky enough to be awarded tax credits, which is a rare occurrence, we would be in a position to be able to start that vertical development by the end of next year.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But again, that depends on a lot of variables coming to fruition in a very short period of time, including having the community committee formed and actually participating with us throughout the process.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And you said if all things align, you will start in 2017.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. Thank you. And then I don't know if this is just a rhetorical question, but in light of what the man from meat and metal brought up, we have had some discussions about issues with zoning in this part of town and industrial zoning next to residential.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And are we and I don't know for you for you are anticipating any problems around those residential and industrial zone districts abutting one another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this might be the best picture you see that outlined in red is the transit oriented development of the site we're talking about. But the blue right next to it is industrial mixed use, which is an attempt in the plan to step back to the industrial, which is the lighter blue in this picture, and still maintain some'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the industrial uses but in between and have a transition area of industrial mixed use before we step up to the transit oriented development. So that's the direction that the plan gives us.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But this blue clad court, is that where Eaton medalists.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My understanding of Eaton medal? Well, it is directly to the east of the property. So my understanding is that the owner of that property was on the steering committee, supported this vision for the plan, and that we this is all secondhand that was told to me.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my understanding is that for their manufacturing portion of their business, we left them in the industrial portion and then for their storage yard and office, it would be the mixed use area, but actually they still have their industrial zoning and unless they come in and rezone, they'll stay in that industrial zoning.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The first one is for Teresa. So Illyria is one of our historical neighborhoods and I want to know what the requirements are for scale and impact. Directly across the street from residential as it pertains to the historical nature.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well it's that looked at is part of the rezoning for this project so it's not subject to review by the landmark commission. So I. So that really wasn't factoring in, in looking at the scale project. The plan really talks about it being a traditional residential area, and we should respect that and step down to that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, Tony, if you could come up for a minute, please. Thank you, Teresa. So you talked about timing and looking at low income tax credits from a. I'm assuming, given the scale of this, that you're looking at some commercial as part of the project?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Possibly, yes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Have you broached the subject with thorough to look at any tax increment financing for the project?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We haven't had a direct conversation about it, but it certainly has crossed our minds that this might be an avenue to pursue, to accomplish some of the infrastructure improvements that are necessary.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know in other there are rare instances that there are examples where a housing development has access to financing, particularly where it's not contributing to the. Volume of tax revenue that the site could generate. So I think that's certainly in line with the discussion that can take place with the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I appreciate the discussion and the questions that have been asked about process and engagement with the community. As you could see from the presence here tonight, that is a very clear expectation. So I'd like to go on to Drew and ask you if you would come up for just a minute.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'To you. You talked about the scale of this project, Drew, in terms of, you know, it's a six acre site. We're talking about 67 units per acre. Where? Give us an idea of where else we have that scale in Denver where we're developing on site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Wow.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know you work in this arena to some degree, but are you familiar with any locations?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I should have something better at my fingertips, but I think I, I off the top of my head, I can't think of 67 units per acre. I was recently the project manager of Phase four of the Mariposa Development for Denver Housing Authority.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which was near 10th and Osage.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, I worked at 10th and Osage, which was about two and a half acres. And that density I think, was about 25 to 30 units per acre. And there was considerable there was surface parking, there was an interior courtyard, there were this quite a bit of site stormwater management.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So there's all these. So it was a lot and it went from four stories to three stories to two stories. But that is at a TOD that was two blocks from the 10th on Osage State Station Derby. I'm honestly I can't.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Think of 60 question though, about that development sort of as a comparison. I'm familiar with that area. And there's there's one high rise building in that area. I don't remember what the zoning is in that area, but there's a senior high rise building.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. And then the rest of that scale is basically four stories I think is right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There's a mid-rise for senior housing. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I know the scale is a little bit of a concern. I mean, people in the community I'm just making a quick comment here. People in the community know that they need density in the neighborhood. But I think there's a concern being expressed that going to the maximum of what is allowed on the site is is a'",
        "'speaker_6': 'little bit much and it's concerning. And so the community process that you're going to be engaged in, I think, is extremely critical to really laying this out in the right way, that it truly is an asset and benefits the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Debbie. Thank you. I think that that's that captures very well the concern.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Just maybe this is something familiar as a reference. So the former baby knows Chili Peppers restaurants up on I-25 there and 23rd Avenue have five buildings there. That development is 45 units per acre, just about six acres. It's a very weird configuration.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It's not a true rectangle in any way, shape or form. The. It's also over parked at 101.69 parking spaces per. So there's a little bit more there. Anyway, I do have questions. Teresa, could you go to slide 15?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I will have questions, but actually I want to talk to Tony first. On Slide 15, you probably need a title. It's review criteria adopted. Consistency with adopted plans. Yep. So, Tony, I don't know if you can see that, but basically south of 48th to 46th between Brighton and York, there is a pretty established neighborhood there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'What is the am I of that neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I'm not aware of that number.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Anyone have that information in the audience? Yeah. Like, what would that census census track MIB? Is it 80? Yeah, I figured I wish somebody had that because I would actually probably posit that 80% am-I is actually gentrification. This area does not.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It has large households that would would reach down to some very low and high levels. 80% am-I are young professionals starting out.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And you know that 80% is not our number. That's the number.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'That's old agreement.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Up to 80%. It doesn't mean it will all be a fact. If we use low income housing tax credits, it'll be 60 and below.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what sort of unit breakdown are you thinking then? Right now.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If you got not that far along in the process, we have yet to even solicit for a vertical development partner. And one other thing I'd like to kind of maybe say at this moment is if we're talking about 400 units in terms of density, again, the 51% affordable overall out of the unit total.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'If you keep reducing the overall unit total, you're in essence reducing the number of affordable units.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So if we're trying to capture if we're if we're if there's a genuine concern about gentrification, how important is it to look at the image of the surrounding community and and make sure that the mix of unit and construction and amenity sort of balances out the needs of that community with your development.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It's quite important. And I would say to you, the Urban Land Conservancy, we're actually promoting the idea of a more traditional community land trust to actually go in to control some of the single family homes in that neighborhood, to keep them affordable, to keep people in place so they do not have to move to a new rental'",
        "'speaker_14': 'community that we can't build in time to prevent the displacement, as you heard earlier in the comments.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So how come some of those agreements and that those parameters aren't with us today? The reason being is that you said that you convened a series of meetings. Where's that output? How come that's not part of this? Why wasn't that shown to council?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'There is a significant public investment in this land and in your programs that you will see. It should be shared along with the specifics about what is desired and how it's incorporated.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm not sure what was in the package that you may have seen, but we actually included all of those things in our application for the rezoning. So there was evidence required of us of those meetings and what the outcomes were.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what were those titled?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I wouldn't be able to tell you that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So are there any firm commitments because you've spoken to them? Are there any why why were members of the community asking for your commitment to this community involvement? Were there any firm written agreements made so that it was it's that the community has confidence and assurance that they will be.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'll say this councilmember maybe you might want to ask about this. We actually proposed at one point a memorandum of understanding or something similar to actually document everyone's expectations. And I have not been able to accomplish that today.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And what do you think's the sticking point there?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I have no idea.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'No. And will the community have a role in the selection of the developer? Yes. Okay. And then lastly. Maybe it's people doing what they're not supposed to do. I don't know. But I have seen, in fact, a development proposal for this property concept.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It was not obviously it predates this rezoning by some substantial amount. What is that?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We actually generated multiple concepts as part of the process that I mentioned earlier last year. So you may have seen one of those. But I would say we were very clear that all of them were potential options and subject to us actually selecting a final developer and vetting those in terms of market feasibility.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The reason why I'm concerned is that those proposals, the concepts that were presented all pretty much pretty close to what I think is is actually a sensible way of approaching this land. My concern is as I come from northwest Denver and when you show me a box like that that Teresa is that defined the heights, we tend'",
        "'speaker_12': 'to get buildings like that and this is obviously a different area. And those schemes spoke to the sort of difference. But 400 units really speak to more of that density that was shown. So how do I comport? What is what is that you guys have yourself admitted that you at least tested versus what I have seen conceptually'",
        "'speaker_12': 'versus the the fabric.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The the diagram that you saw was generated by the planning department just to show exactly as you characterized it, the bulk that this zoning would accomplish on the site. But all of our building envelopes, which are smaller than that, both diagram fit within there.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And it gives us enough flexibility so that if we have to change some of those as we go through this partner selection, we're able to do that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So what sort of commitment are you guys willing to make on those bulks that have been laid out before because they are substantially different?'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I would say to you that there has never been any intent to build out that diagram from our part. Our part.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Great. But please don't let me see here about permits coming for that, because there's something intrinsically different between that in this. So then now back to to Teresa. I wasn't going to talk about this, but my my colleague here brought it up.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And the reason why I was going to talk about it is I do understand that we have the latitude as members of council to sort of, you know, pass zoning Arizonians that we see meet the meet our criteria.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And part of that, when we when we're granting essentially latitude relative to small area plans for affordable housing, that seems like a worthwhile endeavor to me, a good reason to grant additional development potential. That said, there there is you said you used your best judgment when you've read the text of the code.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So going back to the slide that has well, let's stick on this slide. Right. So you already moved there. I want to go back to the slide. We were just at that. We're probably going to go back in number 15.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Which you're talking about. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Because this if you look at that, those lines, what you have is you have an area of five story development that is clearly greater than 50% of the block. And we now go back to the slide. You were at 18.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'When you look at that eight story section, it is far less than 50% of the block. And if we're going to say that, we're going to rely on that on the text, why not just call that all residential between 3 to 8 stories and give it one color, rather than define these steps with the public and then'",
        "'speaker_12': 'get voted on and passed by council? If the language is of that 3 to 5 area, that it should step down closer to a particular street. Because that would then solve my dilemma here, which is that it clearly shows where those steps should occur and what you're clearly using your best judgment is sort of ignoring what was'",
        "'speaker_12': 'already agreed to by community and past council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think that it's a long standing tradition to look at illustrations in plans as simply that. An illustration, not a. Definition of proportion unless there's a proportion defined in the drawing.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So help me out here. This is a illustration on Slide 18, but if I roll back to say Slide 15, that seems to indicate why not just show those lines sort of anywhere? Again, I mean, we try when we're illustrating things to convey what we're showing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, it's it can't be a cartoon in one sense. And then it lost representation another.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're showing the whole neighborhood and we're talking about one property in that neighborhood. So when we're illustrating the plan, that little property is, you know, like a fingernail size on the map that we're creating. And so it's very hard to get an accurate picture of what we're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I just and.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's a blow up of a plan on whatever page in the planning document, I took that little piece of property and blew it up so you could see it better. But that's not how it presents itself in the plan that you adopted.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, it does, but it's all cropped to show just that piece of property. So it's it's very you know, we're talking about sort of graphic scales.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Okay. Then go to page 14.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Page four, slide 14.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'By 14.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'At the corner of Claude and 47th. Okay. It appears to me that there are two individual parcels in these C of single family duplex. Mm hmm. That are.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That are weapons of change.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah, I mean, that's pretty specific mixed use.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. According to this map.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And represented at this same. Nearly the same scale.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I mean, it seems like we pass this language to suit our whatever.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually, that map that we were talking about was developed after the plan was adopted. Again, using our judgment on what the language said and what we thought that illustration was depicting, that this would be a step down from eight to 5 to 3, the primary motivation being to step down to the existing residential and protect that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's why we use that protected zone zone district standard to to work with urban land and come up with the boundary of those areas.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. So just for future reference, see that is in fact putting there drainage for I-70 if it goes through, which is another sort of not merely great idea on clod. On on clod, which is one block went one block through there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So they'll be digging up and they're going all the way to the full depth of the lowest point of that thing right there. So, you know, let's don't put the infrastructure on top unless we know that they're going to replace that.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But we can coordinate with them if that happens. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right. Any other questions? 216. Seen on public hearings, not closed time for comments. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, thank you, Mr. President. First, I just want to thank Councilman Monteiro, who, you know, early on had this vision to work on this with Paul, Washington, with Aaron, Paul with Tony Pickett. And I remember when the idea was first floated, I didn't think that we could get it done that soon.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we did. And so kudos on the purchase of this property and moving forward on the merits of the zoning. I am supportive of this. This, you know, we just passed our guess neighborhoods plans and it's so exciting to see implementation happen just over a year.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so this this zoning meets the plan and in the context and it is I think it's it fits right in plans to counter my colleague over here plans are meant to guide they are not meant to be over prescriptive.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so we've had this conversation before in Cherry Creek. What they're doing is having gradient lines to provide that flexibility. And if that helps, maybe we should look at that. But to me, plan's guide we cannot over be over prescriptive in it to the actual implementation and development of of all of this.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I want to just say a couple of things. One. Councilman Ortega, you're exactly right. Tax increment financing can finance affordable housing. It's being done right now at 2300. Whelton is being done right now. 2460. Welton is being done right now.'",
        "'speaker_9': '2560 Welton and 23 Welton is all housing 30 to 60% AMI affordable housing. So that's a great idea for this would love to work with the community, work with the team to talk about Tracy Huggins, seeing if this is an area of opportunity to the community.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Hear you loud and clear on the infrastructure, the sidewalks, the 40, 47th and York overpass. These are things that in DCC public works. OED we all need to come together and find this. It's going to be interesting on the timing.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is it does the money come first? Then we find the developers and developers come at the same time. Let's let's all work together on that. What you did at Harp was probably once one of the most amazing transformative projects with a really hard neighborhood that's been ripped by gang violence.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And to see what's been done, I'm a big believer. How can that happen here? How can we bring this community is stirring community to empower them to see the vision that they desire to see. So I hope that this can happen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Our office wants to be a part of it and our office wants to help push in DCC OED on all of the infrastructure needs to make this a reality. This is a neighborhood that is, you know, going through a lot of change and we need to do whatever we can to make sure that we see sustainability within'",
        "'speaker_9': 'this neighborhood. And so I'm supportive of that and I want to make sure that it comes to fruition and and make sure that the neighbors feel empowered to lead that effort as well. So I'm supportive of this. I'm excited to see it come to fruition.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I will I hope my colleagues will be supportive of this as well. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez to Councilman Brooks, Councilman Lopez, rep.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Legendary district three.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I will be very brief. I think, you know, I was able to see this plan from its beginnings to see it develop and see the different stakeholders at the table. And, you know, I just I just wish that there were some other folks who are around anymore to see this happen and to see'",
        "'speaker_2': 'this implemented. I think, you know, a few come to mind. But here's here's here's the thing. The fact that this plan is actually being implemented and not be not just sitting on a shelf in CPD is a good thing, right?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In the fact that we actually have some table I, I trust you, the ULC and what they're doing. I think we've worked together in the past on Morrisson Road, which is you. I have some very similar challenges in terms of connectivity, in terms of infrastructure, in terms of bringing life back into into the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Here's the thing. Density helps achieve that. And you know, what we have to consider at this hearing is an issue of zoning. Right. And if it's the right zoning, you can't consider deals and considered deals. You can't consider anything else.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Although those are different fruits that I think this will help produce. And those are different trails that we can all go down and explore. And I think the city and looking at, you know, bringing some of these neighborhoods back on the grid and, you know, focusing in some of these neighborhoods that need that attention with the fact'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that you went on record and talked about the sidewalks and the infrastructure and the needs that go along with it, because the density will bring more foot traffic, more traffic all together. And the desperate need for that, infrastructure upgrades and the you know, what happens to the West doesn't necessarily we shouldn't rely on that one thing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We should rely on our regular general fund money to be able to do stuff like that. Here's what I will say and I think suggest move forward. I mean, I do support this moving forward because I think it does need that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It does that we need that density. I think this is. Zone districts are very appropriate for for the area. They're not a huge increase. I think they're gradual increase and it does get implemented over time. The one thing I would really push for any kind of development happening in the center, when we think of affordability, we think'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a density it's not just the number of one bedroom units is the number of two and three bedroom units that can be achieved. Those are the families that when you talk about displacement, those are the apartments, those are the units, those are the houses that we are dying to build.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And dying to fill in folks who who want to be able to call Swansea and still call Swansea home. Right. Those are the units that we expect to see and I think that's helped. How will you help achieve that balance?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So I'd like in the stages of this plan being implemented. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to express my support for this project moving forward. You know, we're seeing a lot of families in these three neighborhoods already being displaced. We're seeing landlords raising their rents. And families are struggling, trying to figure out where they're going to go next.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's too bad we couldn't have done this project like two or three years ago so that the units would be up and ready and people would have a place to go. And so that's that's a challenge in terms of timing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I just I hope that Councilwoman Montero routinely watches these meetings and that she's seen some of the fruits of her labor and know your efforts in having been involved with this as a staff member to Councilwoman Montero and in the continuity of your continued work in and with the neighborhoods to just ensure that all these pieces'",
        "'speaker_6': 'come together to Urban Land Conservancy. Thank you for your work. I know you guys have played a major role in a number of projects at TOD Sites in making sure that affordability continues to be a big part of many of these projects that, you know, if it if it weren't for that, you know, we would probably be'",
        "'speaker_6': 'seeing market rate developments at most of these sites and not the affordability mix that, you know, comes with the commitment of ULC seeking the low income tax credit resources that help ensure that people who most rely upon public transportation can actually live next to these stops and that they're not all occupied by people who pay higher rents'",
        "'speaker_6': '. So I think that's really important. I think Councilman Brooks covered most of my other comments, but I think this will be good for the neighborhood. The continued involvement with the neighborhood is a vital piece of just making sure that it comes together in the right way with that ongoing community support as part of what will make it'",
        "'speaker_6': 'work in that interface with the residents that are still in the neighborhood. So thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman, can each.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I just briefly wanted to say thank you to you c michael Sapp often uses this term Standing in the gap. And in this case, you stepped into a gap. We as a city don't typically own property, maintain it and plan for its future directly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We respond, but we're not a great person or entity to lead that. So thank you for stepping up and stepping into that gap. For that, I want to say thank you to the community residents for your willingness to help envision into the future enough to say you support this zoning moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Tonight, I heard that that hope and that belief and I think that's wonderful to hear. And I think, you know, we are dealing with an envelope tonight. I think the case is very strongly made for the envelope based on the neighborhood plan that just it's a very close match.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But we all understand clearly that there's more to fill in inside that envelope. And I hear that from all parties. So thank you for the diligence. I know having looked at some of the things in the communities email, it seems like some of those things might be in conflict with the rules for affordable housing as they come'",
        "'speaker_11': 'down from the federal government and how it's financed. But many of the things in there seem achievable. So I hope you don't let agreement on some things stop you from doing an MRU just because you can't get everything in the same document.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I encourage you to get those things you agree with documented and signed, even if you either can't, you know, come to agreement on all the other pieces or you're still working on them. But it seems to me like you've got a lot of a lot of ground here that could easily be documented.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then you can either understand more about the pieces you can't do because it doesn't always work with tax credits or the pieces that you just need more time to do. So that's my my hope is that you can get nailed down the things that you agreed to now.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So good luck to you all. Let us know how we can continue to support you. You're very good at doing that as community and the developers. They know where to find us as well. But but we have a lot of work left ahead of us.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And please know that this will stay on our radar even after we approve the zoning. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman, can each. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, I couldn't help but bringing this up because we just had the marijuana conversation. This is zoned iby today. So this is a for use by right for any marijuana business that wanted to come in here. And so I think it's important that when we talk about visioning the future, folks who are maybe against this project'",
        "'speaker_9': 'need to think about the consequences of the neighborhood across the street as single family residential. And so I just wanted to bring that up because we love that topic of marijuana so much on this dais. Thank you.'",

    "Designation of 200 Block South Lincoln Street Historic District as a Landmark Historic District.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a designation for 200 block of South Lincoln. My name is Karen. I am with Landmark Preservation at the CPD. This landmark designation was proactively submitted to us from the community. Three owners of the does three owners within the designated property submitted it to us.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When a property is landmarked, it is designated as is. There's no requirements to improve it or to restore it to a particular time period. Any changes would go through design review. That is an objective process and it's not frozen in time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can make changes to it. You can work on the interior of the building. We don't regulate paint color or anything like that. But within a historic district, demolitions are discouraged. There are also benefits to being listed in and being a designated property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In general, property values are higher in historic districts than in the surrounding neighborhoods. This is based on the economic power of heritage in place, which is a 2011 study done by History Colorado. And they compared property values of historic districts and then the property values of those around it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They looked at historic districts in Denver, Durango and Fort Collins and found that property values are stable or higher within historic districts. Also, if you are in a historic district, you have the availability to use the Colorado Historic Preservation Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which basically means if you are rehabbing your particular property up to 20% of the interior'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and the exterior repairs would be available for a tax credit, and I know that there are multiple owners within this district that are anxious to take advantage of this tax credit. So for this, the Landmark Preservation Commission reviewed it and recommended it be for it to city council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It then went to Planning Board and they also recommended it to come to City Council by the ordinance. City Council should give due consideration to the written views of the owners as well as the public hearing for the designation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The application was submitted to us in February. And when it comes in, land preservation staff does a thorough review and we actually do research on our own to verify that the information is accurate. Paucity permits from the 1890s to verify that the information within it is accurate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At that point, then we set a public hearing and put it before the Landmark Preservation Commission. It went before them and they approved it to go forward. It went to planning board as well is the plan committee. It went through first reading and we're currently here at the second reading.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We went through and did all of the notification that was required. The registered neighborhood organizations sent out all the legal notices and put it on our website as well. The applicants did a tremendous amount of community outreach for this particular designation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They've been working on this for several years. There were multiple community meetings with John Olson from historic Denver. He participated in one. I then went this past fall and met with the community as well to answer any questions that they might have for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what we're looking at is the 200 block of South Lincoln. It encompasses the addresses from 201 to 246. It's on either side of the street in general between Cedar and Alameda. There are 15 structures within it all would be contributing to the historic district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The period of significance for this is 1889 to 1895, which is encompasses the time period in which the buildings were constructed. So in order to be designated according to the ordinance, it must maintain a historic and physical integrity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then it must meet two criteria and one of the following three categories, and it must also relate to the historic context or theme in Denver. So this if you're looking at the historic physical integrity, well, you look at seven different qualities the location, the setting, the design, the materials, workmanship, feeling and association.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Basically, the idea is, would you recognize this when it was constructed in 1895? Would you still recognize it today? And this historic district has excellent integrity. There are a few alterations to the properties, but those are almost all primarily in the rear of the building as they have been added on to over time.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And overall it's in the same location. It's still along a historic thoroughfare. It retains its workmanship. The setting and feeling are also there as well. So after passing the bar of being maintained or meeting its integrity, it then has to meet two out of the three categories.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So under history it meets it as having a direct association with the historical development of the city. This is just a map of the area. The blue lines there show the historic trolley lines of the area. The district is outlined in yellow.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The little red is already an individual structure, and then the two brown sides on either side are existing historic districts. This district and its growth correlates with the growth of Denver in the 1890s, up until about 1893, when there was the panic of 1893.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the country went from from gold and silver to just a gold standard for our currency. Because Colorado was so highly reliant on the silver industry and the mining industry, there was a downturn in the economy, but this particular area was started growth prior to that, and it continued a couple of years after the panic of 1893'",
        "'speaker_7': '. It coincides with the growth of Denver as the city began incorporating other smaller towns to the south. And it also tax there's all of these trolley lines were developed in the 1890s and so the growth of this sort of reflects as people are able to commute in to downtown.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this area is sort of a reflection of the growth of Denver at the time. The historic district also meets two criteria under architecture. It meets it under the embodying a distinguishing characteristic of an architectural style or type, which is the queen and style.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This district is sort of a queen, a quintessential queen, and they have asymmetrical forms. They have corner towers, they have varying wall textures that are seen in the village board or the barge board and the gingerbread detailing in the shingles on the gable ends.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They have decorative chimneys and brackets as well. It is also significant as the work of recognized architects. There are two primary architects within this historic district. William Lang, who designed the Molly Brown house as well as the Castleman Mansion, designed most of the properties that are on the west side of the road.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And these are slightly smaller versions of these mansions that he built. And it sort of reflects that you had a different group of people living in this part of the town that's a little farther from town and also sort of reflects that the economy then had a downturn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so you were building slightly smaller scale versions then the Molly Brown house. It's also believed that this is the largest intact group of living homes in Denver. So this is a great collection of his work. There's also F.h. Perkins, who was an architect.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'He left after the panic of 1893, but he did design several homes on the east side of the road. He was noted in California and he's also noted in Washington. Several of his buildings are Seattle landmarks. This property, this district also meets it under geography as having a prominent location or being an established and familiar orienting visual'",
        "'speaker_7': 'feature within the contemporary city. Since I started doing this and talking about it, I've had a lot of people who come up to me and said, Oh, those are the tower homes or those are the turret homes. This is something that people are used to seeing as they're driving into Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's sort of the entrance into downtown. And since it's such a large collection of Queen Anne Homes, it's very noticeable and it's orienting to the community. They recognize this. As part of the ordinance. It also has to relate to historic context or themes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it relates to the growth of Denver, to the early streetcar development into late 19th century Victorian architecture. At the Landmark Preservation Commission there were a ten minute presentation done by the property owners and the applicants. There were 11 public speakers, ten were in support and one was in opposition at the time of the Landmark Preservation Commission'",
        "'speaker_7': '. There were eight letters of support within the application itself, plus 19 letters or emails received by our office at that point. We have since received one other letter that is not in support of this and it should be in your packet that was emailed to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So when the Landmark Preservation Commission reviewed this, they felt that it met the historic and physical integrity, that it meant history to under architecture and one under geography, and that it related to historic context or theme. The Landmark Preservation Commission voted unanimously, unanimously to forward it on to city council.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. We have 14 speakers on this one. I'm going to call up the first five. Make your way up to the first pew. Anita Lynch, Terry Garrison, Chelsea Wyatt, Charles Brannigan and Carolyn Bennett. You five can make your way up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And Ms.. Lynch, you may go ahead and begin your remarks when you enter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Good evening, council members. My name is Nita Lynch. I live at 2 to 7 South Lincoln Street and I'm one of the owners of that home and I'm also one of the three applicants. When this application was unanimous, unanimously approved by the Land Landmark Preservation Commission on March 15th, one of the board members even stated that it'",
        "'speaker_5': 'could serve as a template for other district request. Extensive research, thoughtfulness and outreach was done in preparation for this request. Of the 15 houses included, 14 of the owners are in strong favor of designation and one is opposed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do want to address some items maybe of misinformation that could have been presented to council. One is a question of did indeed William Lang design the houses on the West Side? I spent hours and hours and hours of research at the library on the history fifth floor, going through the great big, huge books, making copies, cross-referencing'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the building permits. And it is clearly documented that William Lang did for sure design at least eight of those of the nine houses on the West Side. One of them, we have not been able to find who the architect was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And further, it was mentioned that F.h. Perkins, who was a famous architect, particularly in Seattle now, because he has a number of buildings there that is designated, that are designated, that he was the architect of some of those on the east side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Another thing that might have come to council as not a correct statement is a question of are these clean and houses? They clearly are. They meet the criteria of turrets and the steep pitch roofs. All of this is documented and explained in the application.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also the Molly Brown house is a queen. And the Queen Anne's were eclectic. There was not one single type of queen and. The applicants have worked diligently to achieve the goal of preserving these buildings. And we have overwhelming support from owners, nearby businesses, neighbors which include our West WISCH Park Neighborhood Association and the Baker Historic Neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Association. We fully recognize that there must be a balance between property owners rights and the rights of other neighbors who strongly want these homes preserved. And it is important to balance change with the respect and preservation of historical architecture and history.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I believe that the balance tips in favor of the latter. I urge you to approve landmark designation for the 200 block South Lincoln Street Historic District to honor and protect the block, special place and Denver's history and architectural evolution.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Terry Garrison.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Possibly me. I'll be at Terry anyway. I'm Terry Gulliver. Oh, I live at 227 South Lincoln with Nita Lynch, my partner. I'm also a co applicant. Nita did all the work for the application for our house individually and obtain designation for that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some time ago, the point of this application that's before you now is for the integrity of the district. The cluster of 15 houses was two famous architects built in a period of just six years. At the end of the 19th century, individual owners have spent a lot of invested a lot of money in maintaining and in some'",
        "'speaker_2': 'cases, rescuing these buildings from. Pretty awful fate. And we have we have one member in opposition. I believe that most of the points of that opposition are actually addressed inside the application that you had before you. And some of the other points may be addressed by other speakers here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would ask you to support the application on its merits. Thank you. Thank you. Jesse, your wife.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi, everyone, and thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I own the home.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'At 233, South Lincoln straight and I am the sole member.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Who's opposed. There used to originally be eight out of 21 homes that were opposed in this group and minds the unfortunate one stuck in the middle. So mine's the unfortunate one that couldn't be carved out or excluded. According to landmark preservation, current regulations, which I recommend be strongly changed to be able to exclude those of homeowners who'",
        "'speaker_7': 'don't want to be included in this type of block. This was my first home purchase. This was a huge mark of pride and represents hard work paying off student loans, which I'm sure everyone is familiar with and is a huge amount of my personal net worth and eventually potentially my retirement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm in opposition to choose 72 because this is a bill that forces historic designation on something that's not the community's home, not the neighbor's home. It's my home. First, it places additional restrictions on the home. It reduces the number of contractors that I can actually use to those who may be able to understand or want to work'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on historic homes. And as we all know, the cost of construction is only going up. It also takes additional time for permits to go through for anything that I would like to do to the home. The current time for landmark preservation approval is an additional three weeks for anything that I'd like to do to the outside.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This was something that actually cost me personally, financially, an extra $3,000 in just the last month, because I was told by John Olsen through extensive conversations I had with folks as well, that a desired step out door to an upper deck that already exists, I would never be able to do I'd have to stick with the Juliet'",
        "'speaker_7': 'balcony. That's a window that's broken now. So that's a property improvement. That would be better for myself and my renters, and it's something that I would be unable to do if this had been passed ahead of time. Forth.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This not only limits development, but can actually limit the pool of buyers for folks potentially largely reducing value. There's a home at two 3 to 9 Elliot Street that had a published article on it in Denver describing how the seller actually lost 300 to $400000 in resale value upon this gigantic nation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the Supreme Court has already said as well, if you restrict property rights, you largely reduce value. You don't encourage it or increase it. So that's been stipulated different ways. I've suggested several other options to the Landmark Preservation Company or commission for excluding my home and having it left out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The response was that the current regulation says that this has to be a contiguous block. That's a landmark preservation rule, as far as I know, and maybe it's time to change that rule. When I offered another viable option that one neighbor has already taking advantage of for applying for individual designation on their homes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The Landmark Preservation Commission mentioned in their deliberation that this the case for historic to.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Acquire.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Several homes actually.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was to.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Charles Brannigan.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'My name's Charles Brannigan. I live at 2105 Lafayette Street in a house designed by the architect William Lang.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Who you've heard of today.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I'm William Lang's official.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Biographer.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I think. And I've researched him and his career both in Nebraska and Denver. I'm also the creator of the Lafayette St Historic District, and I am prepared to give you some ideas about why landmark preservation is good. First of all, take William Lang.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'He was Denver's best presidential architect of all times. And the proposed district includes a perfect collection of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'His middle class buildings.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'As opposed to the mansions that he's better known for. Lang began his architectural career as a grocer in Albion, Nebraska. Somehow he became an architect. In 1885, he moved to Denver and hung out there, single as an architect.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And over the course of the next the next decade, he and his draftsmen built hundreds and hundreds of houses. He met and met an untimely end. He died in 1897.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When he was hit by a train.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'He had red hair, blue eyes and a gold cap tooth. I got that from his autopsy report. This landmark designation accomplishes many good things. When we moved into what became the Lafayette Street Historic District, we were considered urban pioneers by the police.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Gunfire was common. There was a chop shop up the street from us, which was eventually gobbled up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By the hospitals.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Our house was in relatively good condition compared to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Most on our blog, but the water in the dog's bowl froze in our dining room in the winter.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Some of our neighbors protected their motorcycles by parking them in the living rooms. The landmark designation stabilized our neighborhood and made it to hospitals. Couldn't gobble up more land. There's been a steady influx of stakeholders who see this landmark protected district as a place that to achieve the American dream.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'State tax credits have helped with renovations. Property values have increased tremendously. Crime is down. Landmark designation started at all. Why do we protect landmarks? They give the city a sense of identity which is missing. When the bulldozer challenges Denver's heritage.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I encourage you to support the landmark application for this this district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Next, we have Carolyn Bennett. And as Carolyn comes forward, I'll call the next three speakers John Olsen, Simone McGinnis, Karen Hinkle, Anthony Hinkle and Lucia Browne. You can go ahead and get your remarks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Hi, my name is Carolyn. Myself and my husband Eric are fairly recent to the neighborhood. We purchased 2 to 4 South Lincoln in April 2014. After many years of looking to get out of the suburbs, we appreciate the architecture of the neighborhood and are honored to own one of the homes that are on the block that is'",
        "'speaker_6': 'up for historic designation. The history of the area was a huge appeal to us and the history and architecture of these unique homes is worth protecting and saving. We feel honored to be one of the owners who have the opportunity to buy here and hope we can maintain that for others.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We understand the responsibility of living in a uniquely historic home, and we want to respect and maintain its authenticity for future generations to appreciate. As we do, we are in the process of renovating and we would have no reservations going through the historic approval approval process or the extra time it takes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We want to get it right. We would value the knowledge and recommendations of the historic society and would not want to do anything that would alter the authenticity of our amazing Victorian home. We would like the protection of this designation so that no one could come and destroy the character and historic value of these homes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'For selfish reasons, we fully support the historic application.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Excuse me. Thank you. John Olsen and Mr. Olsen, you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'All right. Thank you very much. My name is John Paulson. I'm the director of preservation programs at Historic Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're a private, nonprofit.'",

I'm here to express my support of the Landmark District Designation Application for the 200 South BLOCK of Lincoln in Denver, Colorado. The application brought forward by residents on the block is for 15 properties in a contiguous geographic area along both sides of the street.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Currently, it is thought to be the most concentrated block of William Lang design houses in Denver. Eight, possibly even nine of the 15 houses are laying design, but all are various interpretations of the Queen Anne style. Built between 1889 and 1895, Lang was one of Denver's most prolific architects of the late 19th century and the architect of'",
        "'speaker_14': 'historic Denver's very own Molly Brown House, a Queen Anne style building.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In its own right, though, it's very different from the.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Elegantly muted style that we find here. The neighbors first brought their hopes of designation to historic Denver way back in January of 2013. They were seeking our assistance and our advice. The very first outreach meeting for neighbors took place in March of that same year, and I was privileged to attend this meeting to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Outline that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Outline the district designation process and answer questions, as well as pass out informational sheets related to the responsibilities of owning a home in a historic district. Further outreach was conducted by the neighborhood through the spring and summer of 2013.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An application for district designation was submitted.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'To the LPC later that year. However, that application was ultimately withdrawn on the recommendation that the applicants conduct additional outreach to ensure that all affected property owners had all the necessary and accurate information to achieve this goal, the applicant group hosted several additional gatherings to which all property owners were inviting, leading a very proactive effort.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Additionally, handouts and summaries of meetings have been mailed, emailed and or hand-delivered to every household and owner in the district. The handouts and discussions targeted common questions about the effect of historic designation. One of those relates to property values and historic districts confirming that they tend to go up, not down.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The assertion is conferred by both a local study of three historic districts in Denver and as a part of the economic power of heritage in plays published by History.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Colorado as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As several other.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'National studies. And the value of these districts is due in large part not to the individual building components, but to the collection of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Buildings as a whole, providing both.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Stability.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And context. Historic. Denver wants to commend the neighbors who have worked diligently and patiently to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Achieve this goal.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The overwhelming, overwhelming support for this district from the owners and nearby neighbors is a testament to their dedication. A historic district, like a zoning district, does not require unanimous support. However, this district has demonstrated tremendous favor from its residents.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'We are very pleased with the application and believe a historic district on South Lincoln honors an important part of our local history, fosters our city's unique identity and character, and supports economic vitality. It is a pleasure to support this work to protect an integral piece of Denver's history.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Personal property ownership. I was immediately.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Drawn to the beautiful architecture in the neighborhood and it was about eight years ago, 2003, really rough in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At that time. But it was definitely something to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A vision.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'For the future and invest in. And I just couldn't believe anyone not wanting to protect that and having an opportunity for anybody to come in and get rid of any of those buildings.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A little.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A little hard to handle. So I didn't write anything down, but I just wanted to come in and say that I support this and I hope that.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I couldn't afford a house in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'However, I could afford.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This house because it had two rentals in it. I lived in one, I rented out the other two, and I was able to afford a house. And that's how I bought 243 South Lincoln. And I lived there for three years in and then the house down the street went on the market at 209, South Lincoln, the single'",
        "'speaker_4': 'family house. And I was thinking, well, I've got these rentals now. I add to my income, I can buy this house too. And I did. So that's how I ended up with two houses, and I could only afford them if they had rentals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was a flight attendant. We didn't make a whole heck of a lot of money at United Airlines, even though we had a lot of fun. So that's my story and how I ended up on Lincoln Street. People told me I was crazy to buy on Lincoln Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I looked at Lincoln Street. I've traveled all over the world. I grew up in Nevada. And I said, You call this a bad neighborhood and the house.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just love the house. I didn't care.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where it was. And it's not a busy street. I don't care. I've spent years fixing it up. I don't have the big money to go in and totally redo everything. So I've been doing it slowly. However, I just did refinanced.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I put up new gates and new fences and painting everything. It's going to look beautiful soon as it stops raining. So I take a lot of pride in it. And my neighbor Grady, who's lived across the street from me since 1976, proposed that we become a historic district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'When I first bought there in 2000, then I.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Looked in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Awe how our block was really, really trashy when I bought there. I mean, the police were in our alley every other day, sometimes twice a day, people peeing in the front yards and, you know, and it was like, I didn't care.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had a house and it was beautiful. And and slowly over the years, people have moved in and fixed up. And then in the downturn, which actually was kind of good for us, people died there of foreclosures where flippers came in and they actually did very good work flipping these houses where they're still historical.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're still they created a house that invited people to move in. And so now we have a good concrete group of people who live there and who support the designation of being a historic district. And it's unfortunate, I think, that Chelsea doesn't support us because she's our neighbor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, she's also our friend. And I would hope that she would see that this this is going to be good for us. I agree. I think so. I agree. I support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Personal property.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Rights 100%. However, in this instance, I think the whole is is takes precedence over the individual because it is a whole block. So I urge you to support us to become a historic district. And then next time you drive down like this, Hinkle, and say hi.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It remains minutes thank you and I to work for you tonight. It was a lot of fun. Anthony. Anthony Hinkle.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening, everyone. My name is Tony Hinkle. I live at 209 South Lincoln, along with my charming wife, Karen. And I just wanted to say, you've heard a lot of arguments, mostly for, I think that the for far outweigh any negative impacts.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think that the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Benefits to individual homeowners as well as the. Population of Denver and everyone who drives up the street and notices all those homes. I think the benefits far outweigh any any detriments. So I'm totally in favor of this, and I hope you are, too.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Q Jay Brown. And as Ms.. Brown comes up, I will call the last four speakers. Carey Samuelson. Cherry. Gordy Grant. Adrian Brown. Charlotte Winsberg. In any good beginning remarks.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Us get it, get it through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it has worked out wonderfully for Baker. Our property values have gone through the roof, no pun intended. When we're talking about houses. There's no need to fear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of any values going down in this location.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's for certain. Had we not received the designation, we would have seen wholesale.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Destruction of the houses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Which is now happening on the western western unprotected side of Baker in our neighborhood. So designation allows future generations.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To enjoy the beautiful.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And representative homes of the 200 block of South Lincoln. And I do encourage you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All to support this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Designation. Thank you so.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But my thinking was Brown. Kerry Samuelson.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I hate speaking in front of crowds, so my presence up here should be evidence enough that I support this this designation. My name is Carey Samuelson, and I'm here to voice support for the Landmark District designation of the 200 block of South Lincoln.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My husband and I own and reside at 214 South Lincoln Street. I'm a Colorado native. My parents are natives. Their parents are natives. My mother's side of the family moved to the state.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'During the silver rush.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My great uncle was actually the mayor of Fairplay. Most of my relatives settled in Castle Rock, where four generations of my family graduated from Douglas County High School. I know Colorado. I am part of this state and I have spent my entire life watching it change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I still remember when County Line Road was a dirt roller coaster. I still remember when the star of Castle Rock could be seen for miles and miles because there wasn't an outlet mall or a suburbia maze blocking its view.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I also remember what a pain it was that only one grocery store existed in town. I remember when my mom cut her arm on her windshield wiper and we had to drive 4 hours to find an emergency room which would stitch up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good things come with growth and good things can come at a cost. As I say, you can have your cake and eat it too if you want. Convenience. Perhaps the forfeit of the small, quaint town you remember from your childhood is inevitable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have seen the benefits of growth in Denver. I did not grow up in the city and I don't have the same childhood memories of Denver as I do of Castle Rock. But my husband and I have lived in the city for over ten years.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'd be lying to say we don't enjoy the new and nicer restaurants that have accompanied the growth or the fact that by person parks are clean and safe. But it's no secret that there are quite a few more people in town.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It takes a long time to keep down Speer Boulevard. It's nearly impossible to find a quiet tree under watch. Read a book at Wash Park on a Saturday afternoon. It's crowded. This is an unavoidable cost to all of the great things we are enjoying, enjoying about our growing city.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm willing to accept the pains of growth in Denver. I am not willing to define the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Potential removal and destruction.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of our city's history and beauty as one of these growth pains. We purchased our home because it's stunning, because the care and attention that went into its construction does not exist in homes today. Prior to living to our home on Lincoln, we lived in a similar style home in the Baker neighborhood, which is under historic designation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This designation did not prevent us from purchasing the home, but rather.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Compelled the purchase.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Much like Castle Rock. Denver will never be the same once. A Cowtown is now one of the fastest growing cities in the nation. As a Colorado native, I am a dying breed. Every everyone I meet is not from my state and they don't know the Colorado I once knew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And they crowd the parks and they jam up the roads and they cheer for teams other than the Broncos. I guess I accept this, but I do not accept one of them tearing down the gorgeous home next to me to build a modern cement spaceship.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The block on which I live is beautiful. There is no reason not to protect the beauty of the older homes in Denver, if possible. The 200 block of Lincoln submitted. Miss Samuelson. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'You did a great job, though. You do a great job. Next, we have Jodi Grant and Ms.. Grant, you have 6 minutes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Good evening, members of City Council. My name is Gurney Grant or Gertrude Grant, and I am one of the three applicants for this historic district. I want to thank the landmark staff and historic Denver staff for their help and support.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I also want to thank Karen Henkel, who started this process, and Nita Lynch, whose drafting and diplomatic skills have brought us thus far. I bought 242 South Lincoln Street in 1977 when I saw it from a bus on my way home from work.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I also co-own 246 South Lincoln with Doris Bird, who is here tonight. We bought it a few years after I bought 242 because it was only four feet south of our house. And the thought of someone playing loud music late at night was disturbing to folks who work 8 to 10 hour days.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm also a member of an LLC that bought 213 South Lincoln a year ago to save it from demolition because it sits on a large lot and was in deplorable condition. The four LLC members are working hard to save the House.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In 1977, I was the youngest owner on the block. Now I'm almost the oldest. I bought my house because I love the fancy woodwork both inside and out of my house, but also the houses across the street and the other houses on the block.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Since 1977, I have witnessed many challenges in the block drug needles, in the bushes, in front of my house from a drug dealer who lived across the street. Bullet hole in my front living room window when former gang members lived across the street, intoxicated men across the street celebrating there in their boxer shorts on a porch roof'",
        "'speaker_6': 'after a successful garage sale where some of the discards from our alley were sold to homicides in the block, a porch across the street collapsing after the intoxicated men removed the support columns in their jubilation for the roof.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now people are improving the houses and I welcome the change. This group of 15 houses presents to today's passers by and I hope for passers by for years to come. Examples of the 1880s and 1890s Queen Anne style architecture built for families of different size and of different incomes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They were all built within a short span of six years when the Broadway trolley was extended down to Alameda. The houses on the West Side, most of them, those wonderful torte houses, were built on small lots for working folks who could take the trolley in to downtown Denver to work and shop.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The houses on the east side are a little larger on slightly larger lots for people of slightly higher income. And all those had staircases down the back for a maid's room into the kitchen. But they were also built so the residents could take public transportation into downtown for work and shopping.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In this one single half block, viewers can see the contrasts and yet the similarities. There are similar front setbacks, front porches, some with fancier brickwork than others, and none out of character. Owners of 14 of 15 of the houses support this historic district.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Both named both Baker and West Watch Park. Neighborhood organizations support it. Numerous letters in your file support it. I hope you will support the creation of this historic district. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Amos Grant. Adrian Brown.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening. I'm Adrian Brown. I live at 132 West Fourth, and I share my house with my lovely wife, Luciano. I wanted to make two points. First, in response to the concerns, Speaker was while I was president of the Beacon Neighborhood Association, which just before in fact was registered as a historic district, and there were opponents and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'vehement opponents who really were concerned. There are none now after the council and the residents took this important but dangerous step. So I can offer that comfort to the opponents to this. But I also want to point out.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'What a wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Opportunity these residents have given the city in offering their homes to be a cornerstone on a very busy road. And I applaud them for doing that, because otherwise it would be denuded of these historic houses, as Broadway has been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we lost all of those wonderful mansions because it was a main road. And single family homes particularly ceased to be viable on there. These people have done a wonderful job for us as citizens and for you as the council in coming forward to make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I certainly hope you will you will support it. Finally, you in doing so, I think you also make some sort of a commitment to at least think about ameliorating traffic on all of our main roads and from this all the way through to our freeways.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think this council and subsequent councils need to take a long, hard look at the livability of of the houses along major thoroughfares. And you make a wonderful step in approving this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. Brown. Charlotte Winsberg.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'My name is Charlotte Winston. I live at 590 South Sherman. Not. Not on the famed Lincoln Street block here. Batting cleanup and going be kind to you because you have heard so many wonderful things about why you should support this landmark district.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I can't think of anything I could add that would improve it. Everybody almost everybody in this town recognizes those houses because everybody has driven up and down Lincoln and many don't. And they there's dependance. Those of us who live in all Victorian homes treasure them deeply.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I wish my block could meet all the criteria for designation as well. But I want to hold you. Why don't you just all raise your hands and vote yes now and then you can go home. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Mrs. Lindenberg. That that concludes our speakers. Now, time for questions of counsel and I will I'll chime in first. Chelsea, you want to come back at the podium? I'm curious. How long have you owned the property?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've owned it since 2012, and it was a lot more affordable.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I'm curious, you know, this they they mentioned that this process has been going on for a couple of years. And I thought I heard you say that you weren't at some point you weren't the only one that was against it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Did you say eight of 21? I wanted to make sure I heard that correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, there were eight of 21 in the original 2013 application, and this has since been carved up so that there aren't any additional opponents. There also are two opponents who were on the east side who sold in that time frame.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they've decided to reapply. And now I'm the unfortunate one stuck in the middle.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So of the eight. So the other seven that were against it. The other the other seven you were saying were carved out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They were either carved out on either side of the historic designation because it apparently still has to be a continuous block or those two sold.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. And if you could just and I apologize, I had to cut you off because the 3 minutes is up. But you could just kind of some kind of summarize what your what your concerns are and why you're opposed to this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So unlike some of my neighbors, I'm a young person and I have potential, you know, young family needs for growth. I may want to expand the back of the house. I may want to make modifications to the house.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I love Victorian homes and that's one of the big reasons why I bought this as well. I would never demolish the home and I don't think any of these homes, which are all largely valued over half a million dollars now is in danger of being demolished, except for potentially 213, which has already been purchased and is being'",
        "'speaker_7': 'lovingly restored. I don't know that this is something that needs to be an application for all of these homes. I think that individuals can do the applying.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Great. Thank you, Mr. Olsen. Yeah. I'm not sure if you were a part of the original application, but I'm curious if you were if you could explain why I went from 21 to 15. Because in the original application, Chelsea was saying it was 21 home, but then it was done again.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And just to the 15, I'm curious what the reason was for that.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Well, you know, it was based.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Some reevaluation of the what style of homes were being a part of it, as well as the geographical aspect of getting all those homes together. So there were some homes to the south that were were decided that they did not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Fit necessarily with the.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The type of architecture so that were taken out. And also they were, you know, Chelsea is correct that they were opposed. And so because they were on the edge of the district or at the edge of the proposed district, it was possible to take that out and still have a very viable, historic district.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Her situation is that she's in one of the Lang homes right in the middle of the district. And from a standpoint of, you know, in terms of how districts are formed, they're formed in a contiguous way, especially for a district of this size.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'It needs to have a cohesiveness to it. And her home fits all of the criteria. And so it needs to be included in that as a part of the district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Then I do understand, but I'm just curious if it the optics of eight out of 21 homeowners are opposing versus one out of 15 certainly goes better in your favor. So I was just curious what the real reason was for the shrinkage.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So if you say it's it had a little bit to do with architecture or was it just because, you know.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The ones on the ones on the edge.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'In terms of I believe in and we're not a co-op looking on this one. Of course we support it. But, you know, the three applicants were their reasons of, you know, why they're there. Certain homes are included or not included.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'But from from a standpoint.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of initially it was trying to get as much of the.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Block as possible. And then after, you know, having that outreach and then realizing that there were some opposed, it was a relatively easy factor to be able to carve out those edges to the district.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And then, you know.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'There were some aspects of a couple of.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Sales did happen.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So, you know, everybody that's involved now.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'As much as.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Possible.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'You know, is for that particular district.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'And in terms of the you know, in terms of the outreach, the original application in 2013 was put forward there. And because of the opposition that came forward, it was the role of the neighborhood in the role of historic Denver and really even the role of the Landmarks Preservation Commission to do even more outreach to show them'",
        "'speaker_14': 'because.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They're some of.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'The reasons for the opposition were based on inaccuracies in what they thought the district would actually mean. And in that conversation, we were also able to have, you know, some clarifications of that, why that was occurring. And so when the new owners came in and when the owners that were a part of this, they understood everything you'",
        "'speaker_14': 'could possibly understand about being in historic district. This is over three years of doing, you know, outreach. And I had several discussions early on with Chelsea about those, you know, issues in terms of, you know, what are the responsibilities and what are the benefits.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Unfortunately, a number of those things that I offered in terms of additional advice were not taken up by her. And I you know, in the in her testimony talking about, you know, what I was saying, what is allowed and what is not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'I advised her to contact both the Landmark Preservation Commission, as well as just the city, from a permitting standpoint to figure out what would be allowed and what would not be allowed. Like when she's talking about putting additions onto the back, those are very much allowed as a part of historic district.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'So I feel that those are fears are on fire.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I absolutely understand that. And I just wanted to question about the the downsizing and I got my answer. So thank you. I appreciate that. That's all my questions. Councilman Flynn, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Gurdy, would you mind coming back up for a second? Thanks. I used to take the Zero Limited also all the time, and I wanted to thank you for bringing this forward because one of the nicest parts of the commute on up from Broadway station to Civic Center was passing through this part of Lincoln'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Street. But I notice that you also own two other houses to the south of this district, to 58 and to 60. That's correct. And the reason for not including those is exactly what we've been exploring here, the lack of contiguity because there's a house in between.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Is that one of the properties that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Queen Anne's and the houses, the one house in between 246 and the two houses that I own is in. It's owned by an absentee landowner and it's an incredibly bad shape and I think it will probably be demolished when it's sold.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. Thank you very much. Kara, can I ask a quick question? I guess that's. Can I ask a quick question? Because everybody's wondering that I notice that there are some historic districts that also that lack contiguity along a block face and are some like Wyman that actually has an exclave or an enclave of non historic within it'",
        "'speaker_13': '. What is the rule that prevents us or prevents landmark from considering not including a a certain property or otherwise along the block?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We generally like to have historic districts that are contiguous. There are cases where it's not. Sometimes those were cut out. Sometimes they were for political reasons. They were often designated a while ago. So I personally don't have a history of why they were done.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But in general, it's preservation policy. It's part of the landmark ordinance and part of what we look at here in Denver. But it's also overarching preservation policy that you try to have something that is contiguous, that doesn't have what we call a donut hole, which is something in the middle that's missing or that has not just cut'",
        "'speaker_7': 'in and out. It's something we try to avoid.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Okay. But we haven't been able to avoid it all the time in the past. It has. But does that reflect a change in the policy or could that happen again?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, it could happen. And again, when you're looking at something that's a district that's this small and you start cutting things out, you lose the continuity of a district that's only two faces of a street. If you're looking at a larger district, you can still maintain the continuity and the history of it a little bit better'",
        "'speaker_13': '. So a non contributing structure might be carved out in a larger district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, well, it would oftentimes just be non contributing. It would still be within the boundary of the historic district. It would just be determined, non contributing. These all were built at the same time, so they would all be contributing structures.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'I think that's on this problem.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn, Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Just maybe a question for John and possibly for Chelsea as well. What is that? And I feel bad because I'm a licensed architect here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. What is that? What does that turret form that. What is the official name for that thing.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'For the turret. Yeah. I mean, it's. It's a.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Turret. All right. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'All right. That's exactly what it's called. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Question for Chelsea. Is your house one of the turret houses?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'My husband's one. Chelsea, we're gonna we're going to need you to come up to the podium, please.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have a loud boom, but sometimes not that much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My home is one of the targeted homes. I also, in my letter of opposition, question whether these are all Queen Anne's. There's other impacting factors like Queen Anne's are usually would a lot of these are brick that don't meet Queen Anne architecture whatsoever.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is the first time, Kyra, that I've ever heard that it was a possibility to have the home excluded. I was told through and through, including at the landmark preservation hearing on 315 that that was not an option.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that's very shocking information.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But so here's the question for you, Chelsea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So did you know that you can, in fact, do additions? There's this looking I've been exploring the aerial maps.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To the back. I have been told that some things that I actually do want to do that I've now gotten permits for, including renovating the deck or doing a window to a door conversion to my upper deck to make it easy to access and actually step out to the upper deck rather than winding a window and trying'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to crawl through which you currently have to do would not have been an option.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So it's really in the how. It's not necessarily the what unless it's really sort of egregious, but you'll find that, yeah, these really want to use this opportunity to let everyone know and yourself that actually there's a lot you can do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'It just has to be within reason. And then there's going to be an emphasis on one side of the building versus all sides of the building. You know, there's there's other, you know, caveats depending on the house and everything else.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'But it isn't as if people sort of bothered to take their ideas to the landmark commission. I think you'd be surprised how much latitude you have and being part of the district does in fact give you access to other financial tools that that don't that aren't afforded to people outside these districts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think the other concerns of the time frame it would take for approval and the additional cost, I've been told by several contractors who I got to come.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Over for the original door to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Window conversion that I'm trying to do. They won't even touch a historic home. It's just not within.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Their contractors will tell you a lot of things that you know and a lot of it is and it's just I'm being asked not to be believed. Sorry. It is additional time, but with a little bit of planning, it makes no difference in the in the end result.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And and I just speak to that from experience, having renovated the state house of this of this entire state.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Give me some good contractors if it goes through.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'All right. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Just a quick question, Carol, or one. I wanted to allow you to provide feedback. After what Jose just said, that that was the first time she had heard from that. Did you want to respond? Look like you want to respond.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we it wouldn't be allowed to be cut out just simply because of the size of the district. It isn't something. So while it has been allowed in the past, it's not something that would have been an option here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't know that the landmark commission would have allowed it to go forward as that. So while yes, it has happened in the past, it isn't appropriate for this historic district.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. And so in the district, there are 15. Every house is a contributing structure to the district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct? Yes, they all are.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm looking at it here and I can't tell. Are there any empty lots in the district there?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not necessarily an empty lot. There was a house that burned down. And so that lot has been combined with the one that the LLC purchased, I think. And so it's just one larger lot. But it was basically a sister house to the one that's currently there and it burned down a hundred years ago.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So can it be built on?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Sure. Come on. If you want to keep going after that. Come on. Come on up. You got to come to the microphone, sir.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We actually I purchased.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Two feet of land from the vacant lot from my neighbors in order to further prevent the double lot from being split and also to add a walkway path from my front yard to my backyard which the property was lacking.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Formally a double lot any longer. It is two feet under, so 48 feet. So it's not you can't legally build on that.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. So is there a you know, in just all are in this district? I just I'm curious can you build anywhere in the district?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not that I'm aware of. No.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Great. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Actually, I want to make the exception you could build out and on. So I mean that there's space there that theoretically could have something built on it just couldn't do a new stand alone as a usable right. But with variants, you could also look at that because we've done that in Ghost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Right. Any other questions to 72? So, you know, public hearing and now closed time for comments. Councilman Clark.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President, and thank all of you for sticking it out this late with us tonight. I. You know, whenever we look at these designations, you know, one of the things that always weighs heavy is property rights and personal property rights.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this one's a little bit different in that it's not a hostile designation, but there's one person who feels that it's hostile. And for that property it is. And so, you know, I think that does weigh. But I think in this case, it it is outweighed by what's going on here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am a Denver native who always cheers for the Denver Broncos. And I, I remember as a kid trips up and down Broadway and Lincoln to get to downtown. And I remember this block from when I was a kid.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's a block that I always look for as I'm driving and as I'm riding through this part of town. Because it is it's this place where all of a sudden you're transported in time. And it's just a very, very special place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this part of town has, as Denver has grown and will continue to grow, has absorbed a lot of that growth. We have to light rail stations that are very nearby. We just approved, you know, a stationary plan for the former gate site, which is less than a mile away, and the Almeida site around it that has'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a development plan for a lot of density that's a block away. And I think that, you know, as we grow and as we change, we have to identify those areas where we can do that, where we don't just sprawl out and we have to be smart about that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And those areas are identified around those two light rail stations. But then we also have to find that balance in preserving the magic that is Denver and our history. And this is one of those places that I think is is a slam dunk for us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Preserving it is that gateway to downtown. It's also that gateway between a traditional neighborhood and neighborhood in which park that so many people think of when they think of Denver. And it's that gateway now between that and between multimodal development and a light rail station.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I think that we have an opportunity in front of us to preserve something that is very, very special. And we have a group of of neighbors who are so passionate about where they live and about this preservation that a group of them have come together to buy a house when it came for sale, to restore it'",
        "'speaker_2': ', to protect it and to bring it back. And so I am I'm very excited to represent this group of people. And I, I will say to Chelsea that I will be voting to support this. But if you are lucky enough to still own this property for as long as Jersey has owned hers, I'm I am positive.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And you can come find me and tell me I was wrong that you will not lose money because this is preserved, that this historic district where it's located, unfortunately for affordability and for other young people and young families who want to live there, it's not going to get cheaper and it is really going to be a gem'",
        "'speaker_2': 'by our city that that the value will will be tremendous, both to us as a city, to us as Bronco loving Denver rights and 2 to 4 generations to see what what the city was and how it how it grew up.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I will be supporting this tonight, and I strongly urge all my colleagues to do so as well. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilman Black.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I couldn't say it better than. Clark just said it. So I'm not going to add much except for to say Chelsea. I also am supporting this, but you do not have to wait as long as gurdy.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I'm not calling you old Gerd, but it's 1970. Whatever was a long time ago. I would. I believe in personal property rights. I know your property is going to be worth more as soon as this passes. The tax credits are available.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I, too, have driven down that street. I continue to drive down that street on my way to work every day. It's an important block to preserve in our city, and I know it will not be a negative thing for you.'",

        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I couldn't say it better than Councilwoman Black, but I want to and I just want to put out there that in my district, there are some. There's an enclave of historic homes that's not designated.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'But there are people in there who are faithfully restoring them to the mid-century modern style. And the folks who are doing that are realizing substantial increases in in their values compared with the few, unfortunately, that have been re re styled outside of the bounds of the mid-century modern cliff may style, they have sold for substantially less than'",
        "'speaker_13': 'the gain of the ones that have been faithfully restored. So I just wanted to echo what Councilwoman Black said, that I believe historic preservation in a district context will will only add to the value. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I hope for your sake that Chelsea is not a hoarder and a cat woman. In 40 years, that could be a rough property. You're in one of the tenant homes and. And that matters. And that's unfortunate for you, but it's actually, in the long run, going to be fortunate for you.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I would support it because that because I've seen this property over the course of 30 years, used to commute right by it every single day, and you don't not notice the turrets. What you did notice was the condition of that block, which was not good for a really long time.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And when one person finally there was one person that always sort of maintained his house, but then when one person took one that was in that was very much neglected and started to transform it, that transformed that block.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I don't know what you guys were all doing, but at some point it turned a corner and a domino effect occurred. And the profit that log went from from one of roof rental to one that that's achieving a potential that it had always been there.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'The nice thing is these are durable homes that are that are capable of withstanding neglect and then being brought back to life to their former glory, which is really tough to say for I mean, I can't say that for some.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'A lot of the new construction that goes on in in northwest Denver, a lot of people, when those things start to leak, are going to be coming looking for you to pay with their million dollars, provided you take care of it, asking for a real house, one that's got more than a 30 year shelf life.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'So that's the thing is it would really I, I respect the fact that they they basically insisted that you be part of it because because you you notice the pattern, you notice all those turns and your eye is drawn to it and it makes part of commuting up Lincoln wonderful.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so it's a sacrifice, but it's, it's, it's part of what makes Denver unique. And I'm going to be supporting this, but I do think that in the long run, you'll find that you can capture most of what you want to do.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You can do it not as economically as you need to. And and you're going to have a very stable neighborhood, because that's what happens in historic districts, is is it becomes a known quantity and a very, very desirable part of town.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. President, I. When I saw this come up, I just had a lot of memories. And that memories, those memories for me are living off a link, living right off a Lincoln Street on 664, South Lincoln.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I was when I first had my first apartment and 17, 18 years old, and that was it. And so commuting up and down, I remember walking every single day to school over at UCD, every single day going up Lincoln on the bike, walking with groceries and those.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The thing about historic districts is as you know it when you see it. Right. And and this was one of those areas of town you come in from South Lincoln where you you know, it. The houses have a particular flavor to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The block has a particular flavor to it. And, you know, I you know, I definitely understand your concern. It does it does bother me that this is the first time you realized that you were able to actually possibly opt out of it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know, the question of how they were selected still remains in my mind, because I think there's probably some houses there that are probably left out that perhaps could be included in it. And when you drive down that, you just you just see it, you know it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so, you know, I, I know that you have a great councilman representing that area. And, you know, I think, you know, any time you have any kind of issues running into permitting or questions about what you can and can't do, I think that's a just an amazing resource to have as that, you know, as it develops'",
        "'speaker_2': '. But, you know, I, you know, I have a villa park Bab house on a slab. Right. And it's nothing like the house that you were in. Those houses are solid. They last for a very long time. And if you take care of last forever, I just you know, I'm supportive of the of the historic district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am supportive of this moving forward for preservation. However, I do think that we should be, as we start identifying some of these blocks, that we should be mindful and very, very flexible with some of the residents. I had no idea that they're going to be buying into a historic district.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. So thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I'll try to be brief and not be redundant. I live in a very old home. Mine was built in the late 1800s and just being able to do work on these older homes that have just incredible woodwork and just unique characteristics, it's it's a work in progress and it takes time and money to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be able to do the kind of improvements that we all want to do on our homes. I also was very intimately involved in the Baker Historic District. The Lower Downtown Historic District and the Potter Highlands District, which are all some of the larger districts that we have in the city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And in every one of those districts, the property values immediately increased. And this was long before we saw this uptick in our economy and the impact to the housing market all across the city. These were neighborhoods that saw some real stability in knowing that, you know, the property next to them was not going to be torn down'",
        "'speaker_6': ', particularly in the lower downtown district when we worked on that. We had a number of property owners who were reluctant to have their building designated as a historic building. But, you know, fast forward to today and everybody really appreciates the fact that those buildings were, in fact, preserved.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's a thriving part of our downtown. I mean, you know, we've extended the downtown all the way to include lower downtown and beyond. And so I think the concerns that have been expressed about. Impact to property values are not going to be realized.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think you'll you'll see just the opposite of that, as we have seen in other parts of the city where these historic districts have been around for some time. And I don't I don't see John Olsen still out in the audience, but correct me if I'm wrong, but in these historic districts, you can actually access grants to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'be able to do improvements to your properties. And if you can just kind of shake your head to confirm that. That's correct, John, because we're in comment period now, not question answer, but yes. Yeah. Okay. So, you know, I think there are opportunities available to folks who have historic properties.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it's to that that very point. But this is a beautiful part of the city. And being able to preserve it for future generations is, I think, important. I regret the fact that we had some incredible buildings that were in our downtown when at one point our urban renewal authority was part of the the vehicle that was'",
        "'speaker_6': 'helping tear down and work with developers to do some of these buildings. And there was a big push from folks to try to save some of those buildings. And, you know, we're lucky to have a number of them along our 16th Street corridor and in other areas of downtown.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So. For people who come to this city and to try to recall what once was in my neighborhood in lower highlands, which is drastically changing, you know, being able to see some of that preservation is is really important to just knowing the history and the culture of our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I will be supporting this tonight. And I just want to thank the community for all of the hard work that went into putting this together. It takes time. It takes a lot of energy. And for every one of you who were involved in shaping this, congratulations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I have a much more pedestrian comment to make. Not so high minded as my council of people. Thank you for one of the most entertaining public comment period we've had in a very long time. I appreciate it very much.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Sussman, in the comments to 72. I will I will chime in briefly. One thank you all for coming out and sitting here in those chairs. I thought they were going to be here sooner than we got to this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But Chelsea and and being knowing you're the one lone opposition to this is come and speak your mind I appreciate you doing that. I didn't I didn't ask this question. But I imagine one of the reasons why you purchased a home was because of the charm and the esthetics is something that you really appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And you even mentioned yourself that, you know, you wouldn't even consider tearing it down. And I understand your concerns, and it's easy for us to say we're property rights advocates when it's not our property and how we can easily just wave that magic wand and say, Oh, yeah, we should do this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I don't think it's a slam dunk as much as other people say this is something I will support. But I, I have concern about the optics of that and whether or not it was intentional to shrink the size to have a better view.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I just think that that doesn't look right and doesn't sit well with me. I also think that we're a little naive to say you can accomplish all the things you want to do. It's not that hard. I respectfully disagree.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I, I was looked really long and hard into finding an adaptive reuse for the Stapleton Tower, and one of the things we considered was historic preservation. And when I did some research and all the restrictions on that, and once you did, that gave me pause.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so that's something that I didn't want to consider, and that was just my personal opinion. So there will be some challenges and that's just the reality. But the greater good is that we'll have a beautiful collection of homes that show a part of Denver that can never be taken away.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that that's something we need to consider as well. But I just think it's unfair for us to just look at you and say, Oh, it'll be easy. You'll gain all this money back. And that's just not the reality of it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But we appreciate I sincerely appreciate your comments and sharing your thoughts. And I also appreciate all the other neighbors that worked really hard. And I know we love our neighbors and we all want to get along and sometimes we don't.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But I, I can tell you, I really do get along. So I think that that's great. And no matter how this felt goes, I can I can imagine still be good. Neighbor So see no other comments, ma'am. Secretary Roll call.'",

    "Preservation Designation for Emily Griffith Opportunity School.": [
        "'speaker_7': 'Oh he's excited about the owner supported. Yes so it is an owner supported this is for the entire block and it is divided into contributing and non contributing areas. The contributing areas include the 1926 schoolhouse as well as in 1847 and 1956 editions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This was submitted to CPD on April 1st. It went through the Landmark Preservation Commission. It went through the committee first reading and second reading is right now. All of the notices were done correctly. It was posted on the website in legal journals and all of the RINO's were noticed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a slightly different application, so I'm going to kind of talk about this as being Denver public schools were involved as this is their property. They have a policy called the fee policy, which deals with historic schools.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the intent is to facilitate the long term preservation of the school district's most architecturally and historically significant schools, but also to meet the board's ongoing responsibilities for educational requirements and to provide flexibility for future generations to construct new facilities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The route for this particular designation started with a certificate of non historic status in 2012. Denver Public Schools withdrew it after historic Denver expressed interest in landmark designation. They initiated the FB policy evaluation. They hired the architectural firm of Slater Paul to complete the historic structures analysis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The HSA confirmed the National Register of Eligibility Determinations that there was that it is eligible and that there are adaptive use potentials for the building. So Denver Public Schools convened the Historic Evaluation Committee, which is made up of historic Denver Landmark Preservation Staff and History, Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They basically agreed with the HSA findings and the committee determined to prioritize the designation of the Welton Street site as an option. Denver Public Schools formed a sales advisory committee and they wanted to balance capital needs, downtown development, zoning needs and preservation values.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city and county of Denver then hired Humphrey Polies and there is actually a representative of them in the crowd as well. If you have questions to do a study of this and to rate the designation and they felt that that they wanted to preserve the most significant buildings, which are those along Welton Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so the recommendations from this study were the basis of the application that's before you. This is a slightly different application. It's going to be kind of three parts. There's the standard designation that you guys have seen in the past.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then there are two other sections, one that deals with the design and development patterns, and it's an addendum to it. And then there's also a supplemental design standards and guidelines, which is an attachment. So part one for the Emily Griffith School.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It is designated as a structure. Its zoning is DC and you one it's for the entire block of 170, which has been the historic boundary of the school since about the 1940s. But we understand that there's a large redevelopment for this particular area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this is an opportunity to integrate the older historic building along with new construction. So the contributing area is along Welton Street. These are architect designed buildings. They were purposely planned and designed as the main street of the school.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They were the primary operations and classrooms here. And these have the strongest association and history with Emily Griffith herself. The non contributing portion along Glenn Arm has some consistency in the architectural style, but it's much more simple. These parcels were purchased over time and there's less of a design plan for those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So in order to be listed, it has to have integrity and it has to meet two out of the following three categories and relate to a historic context or theme. This particular property has very high integrity. The school, while it was originally built on the edge of downtown and had more of a mixed residential and commercial setting'",
        "'speaker_7': 'originally still is in the same location. The original architect's design is intact, the brick and terracotta is visible, and it still has a really strong street presence. It meets the criteria under history for direct association with historical development of the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The school was founded in 1916 and it provided an alternate education for the residents. It's a very innovative and early form of this kind of education. There was a lot of work for workforce training, for auto mechanics, plumber, plumbers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It helped build a competitive, competitive workforce for Denver. And there were a lot of partnerships during World War One and World War Two with the Emily Griffith School for Training the Workforce. It's also directly related to Emily Griffith herself.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She was the driving force behind this. Behind this school, she is was the principal until 1933. She founded in 1916. And she is recognized at the state capitol as a very important woman within Colorado history. The property is also significant for its architecture.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The original 1926 design has Renaissance revival styles with Beaux-Arts embellishments, and it's done with a lot of brick and terracotta details. The 1947 and the 1956 additions integrate the brick and terracotta, but they use an international style. And this would be one of the first international style buildings in Denver if it is designated.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And finally it meets it under geography. This is a prominent location. It's just off of Colfax. It's highly visible. This school was called out on travel maps of the early 20th century, and it's one of the few remaining historic schools in the downtown area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It relates to the themes of vocational and continuing education, as well as women's history. And the period of significance for this property is 1916 to 1956. The Landmark Preservation Commission determined that it had physical integrity, that it met the criteria under history for historical development, as well as being associated with an important person that embodied distinguishing characteristics'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of an architectural style or type, and that it had a prominent location and was geographically significant. They also believed it in its historic context and themes of Denver, and they voted unanimously 6 to 0 to recommend it going forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So part two of this particular designation is intended to help preserve the most significant parts of the building that are associated with Emily Griffith to retain the sense of massing and form as these distinct buildings and to make sure they're visually, visually prominent on the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it's also to accommodate new construction and the idea that there's going to be new, dense development primarily along the glenarm side of this. And so it's to ensure that you can integrate both the old and the new.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So within this there will be a contributing a non contributing section within the non contributing section. Applications for demolition would not go to the Landmark Preservation Commission, but would be approved by staff. However, they would not be released until there was a replacement plan that was approved by the LPC.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That is actually also true within the most part of the contributing areas. There's the demolition area for contributing that could also be approved by LPC staff for demolition. However, it would have to have a replacement plan improved in place by the approved by the LPC and also a plan that would show if you demolished part of the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'contributing building that the rest of the building could still be retained and would still stay up. That does not include the demolition, does not include the initial 1926 building, building, as well as the facing of the 1947 and the 1956 addition.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Within that, what we're calling the preserved area that would go through the typical landmark preservation design guidelines would go through on the typical design guidelines that are currently in place. It includes the significant buildings along along Welton Street on the key Frontages and retains the cantilevered vestibule that's on 13th Street.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any part of demolition that would go through on the preserved area would be subject to the general chapter 30. So in terms of design parameters for this, there are two areas that are restricted, firm, any type of development.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There the small yellow areas, restricted areas one and two. And the intent of that is to preserve the size of the buildings and give some sort of allow those buildings to remain prominent, the historic buildings on the site, while also allowing for development and growth in the transitional height area, which is the area that can be demolished'",
        "'speaker_7': ', although it is a contributing building that would be allowed up to 112 feet. The remaining part is only restricted by zoning and the state owned state capital of you in terms of the size of the development and in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Part that faces glenarm. And so this is kind of just to illustrate some of the areas that could be preserved in the areas that would allow for development. The yellow portion of that is the preserved area, and it's illustrated above is the part that would be protected and then you would have the non restricted height envelope and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'would allow to go as high as a zoning would allow for that area. So in order to sort of enforce that and to maintain that part of it will preserve, but also allowing for new construction. There are design standards and guidelines, and these are intended to be customized design guidelines for this particular site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's to allow significantly larger construction abutting or connecting with the historic building. And so it's to encourage and integrate both the old and the new and to ensure thorough and high quality architectural design, articulation and materials for new construction.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is a separate document that would be approved as part of this designation process. Landmark Preservation reviews the design guidelines and standards as part of the designation as a whole, and then they in the preserved area in the other areas, they would combine the traditional design guidelines with the new design guidelines that are attached with this designation'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Those design guidelines are intended to address the transitional height area, the restricted areas, as well as the zoning restricted areas. And there divided into four parts with an addendum that talks about the character defining features of the historic building at the Landmark Preservation Commission.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There were there was a letter from historic Denver, which is a co applicant, as well as 30 additional emails and letters of support. We have not received any other emails since the Landmark Preservation Commission Commission hearing. There were four comments from the public.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And design guidelines has been carefully considered. Having the support of the historic community as evidenced by historic Denver being a co applicant. There is a testament to what is possible.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Of collaboration, the willingness of the civic, business and development communities to engage and provide input on how to balance the goals of the school district and the interests of the broader community has been invaluable.

        "'speaker_5': 'We found dozens of them.

Denver schools were built to last 100 years and more. And they have, consequently. All the schools first surveyed met Denver's landmark commission criteria for designation to designate all would devalue the recognition.'",

        "'speaker_7': '5157.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you. That's almost perfect. I just want to get a sense of the scale.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Brooks?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. Kira, quick question. Thank you, Mr. President. Gina is the Gina guy. Is he the one who who wrote or that person? Is that the one who wrote the letter of opposition or spoken opposition?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can double check the name. I don't have it right here in front of it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It is. But just can you give us for just this?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'She was basically concerned that designating the historic property would lower the value that Denver Public Schools could get for the land. Another member then of the community then spoke up who was part of the sales advisory group and felt that this would allow for a good value for Denver public schools.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Knowing the surface.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Is Gina a part of DPS at all or just a concerned citizen?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I not that I'm aware of. I believe she's just a concerned citizen.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember in other questions, 311. Seeing on public hearing is now closed. Comments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Councilman Brooks, how many questions for this one, huh? I am excited and really happy to support this designation. I always love to hear KERA Dona Dona owner support it, but I personally was involved this couple of years ago with in the process and was in the early meetings with Down Syndrome in partnership with Davida, leading those meetings'",
        "'speaker_9': 'with Annie Levinsky with many stakeholders. And I want to be clear that we are celebrating today, but there were many days in that room where I think I think folks were pretty far apart. And it's just amazing to see the community kind of come together.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think Bradley can and played a huge role in that as well with his ideas as well. And so I'm excited to support this. Sara, I appreciate you bringing up Jennifer Moulton. You know, for for some of us younger urban leaders, she was a visionary that we long to live after as we're city builders here.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so I appreciate you bringing her up. The other reason I really am supportive of this is I think it sets a precedent for what we can begin to to see the integration of new development in historical buildings in downtown begin to look like.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So thank you for the Denver Public Schools for being a part of this and being so open around this whole issue and everybody else who works so hard to be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In Katherine Brooke. Councilman each.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Brooks, for the role you played in the process. I was actually going to remember a time slightly even before that, which was with my former colleague, Councilwoman Raab, who really we have to credit her for helping to start the conversation early when the certificate of non historic status was filed'",
        "'speaker_11': '. Our first meeting that I went to with Councilwoman Raab with the district was not so supportive. There was a flat out statement that there's just no market potential for this site if we do designation. And Councilwoman Raab, with her experience, was really able to offer the ideas of bringing in developers with expertize to get their input.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think there was a walk through that happened really early in the process, even before there was a commitment to the committee. And that walk through is an example where folks were in I don't remember who we got.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We had suggested folks like Dana Crawford and Charles Wooley and and but to to hear from folks to say there are ways that this could be done. You know, and I think that that first seed of it could be possible.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to thank Councilwoman Robb and for her, I think, diligence in helping to kind of help plant that seed and and help do a little activism. And I'm very glad that we have the happy story that we do.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But sometimes in those early days, it takes a strong advocate to get that started. And so in this case, I just want to honor her and I'm excited to support this today. My experience with Emily Griffith is through the amazing construction apprenticeships that they have hosted at that school, all of the construction apprenticeships, including most of the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'union and a few of the nonunion, they get 42 hours of college credit and they've been earning them through a certification that Emily Griffith provided. So one of the things I hope with this designation in this redevelopment is that we get apprentices working on this building as it's rebuilt around with the new development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That would be a great way to bring Emily Griffith's legacy to a completion. So I hope you negotiate that in your sale contract because it would be a missed opportunity if we didn't anyway. Happy to support it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilwoman. Can each next. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'Yeah. Comments. I just wanted to say, this is brilliant. This is a genius. Love it. Love how creative everybody was. And I like the councilman, Brooks said. I hope it sets a precedent. I know this is not easy work and we can't always do this, but I do think we should.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'We should be able to figure out how to when we have those buildings that we go, oh, when we see it, when a proposal comes in, whether they've applied for historic MENA status or, you know, it's going to lead, there is do we have the tools to sort of capture both new development in a creative fashion?'",
        "'speaker_12': 'I think part of the charm of Europe is they figured that out. And so we sort of have the two extremes. It's either preservation and maintaining it in its in in an intact form or gone. And there's actually a lot of potential in in this sort of blending.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'And so where we have those opportunities, I'm glad to see this this happen and this tool exists because I think we're seeing it over there potentially at the tavern as well. So thank you to historic Denver, Annie and John Annie.'",
        "'speaker_12': 'You guys are doing a wonderful job and CPD staff. Thank you, Brad. Thank you. So thanks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Shooting. There are very few places in Denver that I think can match this site for its historical significance, along with its connection to so many, probably thousands of residents of Denver. I can think of maybe Union Station as another example where not only a historic structure, a magnificent structure, a beautiful structure, but one'",
        "'speaker_13': 'that has a connection to the daily lives of of so many people who grew up in Denver. And it's just a pleasure to to see this. It's it's almost an emotional connection to this building with a lot of people in Denver who took advantage of what what Emily Griffith established in 1916.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think, Mr. President, my only regret is that the building on the on the Glenarm Street side is is going to be demolished because we taped so many programs from DPS on Channel six of Don Kinney's State of Colorado show in there.'",
        "'speaker_13': 'And I think just for that reason, it ought to be historic, but it'll be sad to see that one go. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I know the answer is no. I know you want us to stop talking, but I just have to say, I have a long personal history with this school. My dad taught there in the fifties.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He taught bookkeeping and accounting. And I have a very long personal history with the Denver Public Schools. Hello, David. A long time supporter of DPS and the Emily Griffith Opportunity School, which is no longer called that. And as co-chair of the 2012 Bond Committee, we talked about this building a lot because its sale was supposed to fund'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the purchase of 1860. Lincoln, which is the home of the new Emily Griffith Technical School and High School. So I know everyone figured out a way to make it all happen, so I couldn't be more thrilled and also thrilled that Emily Griffith's legacy continues at 1860.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Lincoln, which is now called the Emily Griffith campus and all of the things that she worked for are still happening today. And it's really incredible. And it is one of the greatest success stories of the Denver public schools.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I am picking that up from that screen. I am super enthusiastic about this designation. You know, I think Councilman Flynn really hit the hammer or really hit the nail on the head and that it has so many such a big connection to so many people in the area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I talked about him earlier, but my grandfather was pictures right here and played the role of my dad. He was called to service in World War Two before he can finish high school from Ault, Colorado from up north and really use a beat picker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'He ended up coming back and was able to finish that a program for folks who if they had, he was an older high school student. So after they came back from the service, he came back and finished his high school diploma at Emily Griffith.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that was the impact that that had for him in his life. But there's so many people around that time in Denver. Emily Griffith was the school. It was the school to go to. Yes, it was west and east and north and south.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But you still had Emily Griffith right there. And he was able to do that, finish out and. You know, provide a foundation for a lot for a lot of his children and grandchildren. And I think, you know, that that's the historic nature of the school.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can talk about the architecture, but in its walls and in its brick and mortar, those kind of stories throughout Denver. So, you know, thank you. I'm proud to vote yes for this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. I believe that all the speakers.'",
        "'speaker_14': 'Are actually all the councilmembers are chime in our.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Screens. Kind of crazy right now. I think that's everybody. So they were good. All right. So you know the comments, Madam Secretary, wrong call. Roll call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Brooks. Hi, Clark. Hi, Espinosa. Hi, Flynn Hi. Gilmore I can eat Lopez. I knew Ortega I black I Mr. President. All right.'",
