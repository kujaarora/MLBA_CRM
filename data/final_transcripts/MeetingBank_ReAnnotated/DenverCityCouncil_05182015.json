I, I just can't speak highly enough for this department, and I think you guys are kind of the unsung heroes.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you very much. Thank you for a proclamation. But more important for the relationship that the members of the council have developed with public works, I think this is very, very important that we have this type of relationship in order to not only maintain the city, but continuing building the city the way we were doing.'",

It affects people in middle age, in forties, fifties, and it affects the baby boomer cohort that was born in 1945 to 1965. Unfortunately for the past, for the first time in the past 30 years, we're seeing an increase in new infections from hep'",
        "'speaker_3': 'C. There is a huge amount of transmission in the seventies and eighties and then the incidence went down and as I said, for the first time in 30 years, the incidence is increasing again. Our current data suggests that in Colorado the incidence is stable, but our data is based on surveillance from 2012 and 2013.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's the most up to date numbers that we have statewide about hepatitis C in neighboring states, including especially the ones in Central Appalachia or Appalachia, depending where you're from. They've seen a 364% increase in hepatitis C among people under age 30 from 2006 to 2012.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, 30 states around the country have seen an increase in hepatitis C and in that same time period. The CDC reports that in those Appalachian states with which are Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, they've seen a concurrent increase in admissions for treatment for opiate abuse and specifically injection drug abuse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The link between opiate abuse, injection, drug abuse and hepatitis C is very clear. This has been well documented in Colorado. As you all know, we have an increase in prescription drug opiate abuse in Colorado. And similarly, we have an increase in heroin use in both urban and non-urban areas in Colorado.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In fact, from 2012 to 2013, there was a 27% increase in heroin use among people ages 18 to 24. We hope that harm reduction measures like needle exchange and increased testing that have been implemented to prevent HIV transmission will stem what seems like an inevitable increase in hepatitis C among young people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'However, as treatment is not widely available for hepatitis C, the increase in hepatitis C that is coming to Colorado seems unfortunately inevitable. The second large population that's affected by hep C is the baby boomers in Colorado, specifically in the Denver metro.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have an increase in liver related cancers, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and liver related death. Many people were infected before hepatitis C was even discovered, and the blood supply wasn't tested until 1992. So now, as the people who are infected in the seventies, eighties and early nineties are approaching 30 years of infection, they're developing complications of hepatitis C'",
        "'speaker_3': '. It's a very indolent virus. But when it develops into hepatitis, into cirrhosis, the risk for decompensation and liver disease related death increases significantly. Our estimates from the state level suggest maybe 3000, maybe 7000 cases of hepatitis C. However, estimates from local data from Adams, Arapahoe and Denver counties suggests we may have 20,000 cases in just those three'",
        "'speaker_3': 'counties. Therefore, the cost, the morbidity and the mortality from hepatitis C will be increasing in the coming years. The majority of patients have Medicaid, so there will be an increased public burden of the cost of these treatments or lack of treatments.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Testing for hepatitis C is the most important way to start the treatment process and to stem the growing morbidity and mortality. As I've mentioned to you the past two years, we've been doing a community testing initiative at Denver Health where we test in all of our community health clinics.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We found that of 3000 baby boomers tested who had never been tested for Hep C before, 9% have hep C. So these are folks who never knew they had Hep C of the African-American men tested. 16% have hepatitis C.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is an incredible disparity in our community that needs to be addressed and also speaks to this increase in morbidity and mortality that we will be seeing. That concludes my comments and I'll be happy to take any questions.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'I'm sorry. Wasn't able to get the details on this, but I can definitely clarify for you and send you an email in the morning. Okay. I would appreciate it. Absolutely. I'll let it go forward on. Thank you. On first reading.'",

So I'm trying to understand what the total amount is for the 61st Avenue Pioneer Boulevard Transit Station. When I add up the numbers from the first two bills, it looks like it's $38,139,192.'"

    "Intergovernmental Agreement with RTD for Light Rail Station at 61st and Pea Boulevard.": [
        "'speaker_3': 'But then Council Bill 260 speaks to 35 million. And so I'm trying to understand what the total cost is on this project. It looks like the city via DIA is up fronting $17 million. Is that accurate? At least that's what I'm accountable to.'",
        "'speaker_3': '60 is saying. So, Stuart, are you the point guy or. Dan, would you mind coming forward and answering my questions?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Council president and council members updated Perryman, the senior vice president of development at DIA. And to answer the specific question on cost, the total cost for phase one of the Penn Station Toad Project is 58.7 million, and DIA is contributing 38.14 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The neighbors are contributing about 20.5 million neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Meaning? You said the neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The neighbors. You may remember that breakfast at this 400 acre Todd project in addition to these 60 acres. There's actually three other landowners of the fallen water company. Elsie Fuller Minor owns about 150 acres. They are the lead developer.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Ferd Belz is here tonight representing Fuller Weiner. There's also the Smith estate, which owns an additional 150 acres. And there's a smaller piece, the same tea parcel. That's about 20 acres. There's also about 38 acres of open space.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So these four owners have come together and process this Todd transportation oriented development plan over the last several years with a number of related agreements through council and have worked out now over the last couple years this plan of financing development for the Phase one infrastructure, as well as the Penn Boulevard East Line Station at this location'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and the connecting infrastructure and station together totaled a 58.7 million of which DIA is contributing 38.14 million upfront. Two things to remember. One is that DIA is projected to be completely repaid for that investment through metro district levies that are assessed on the neighbors property that I mentioned.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And over 40 years, it's projected that we will be returned about $41 million, actually $42 million in total reimbursement. The other thing that's really important to remember is that this opens up for DIA a consistent and rather large non airline revenue stream that totals we're projecting somewhere between hundred.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Let me just check my figures on that, between 132 and $194 million over a 40 year period. So we're actually projecting that the DIA investment of 38.1 million is repaid within a period of about 15 years. So to answer your your part of your question, which was within the financing concepts, the reimbursement that comes through the Metro'",
        "'speaker_9': 'District, repayments on the neighbors property, we actually those those are tied to specific interest rates against specific dollar amounts that are just portions of the total investment that was really done for financing purposes. But those two reimbursement amounts are 35.6 million and 6 million.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And those total, the 41.6 million that's being reimbursed to DIA over time through these MIL levy reimbursement mechanisms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So then can you just clarify, you spoke to this being the first phase. So what entails any additional phases that will include additional cost to the city, whether it's from DIA or somewhere else within the city?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The the phase one infrastructure as well as the station costs or the the lion's share or the great majority of the total development cost for this TOD. But there are some future phases that pertain to the installation, primarily of streets that go into expanding the development sites.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'At DIA's projected future phase, investments are in the range of about $6 million today.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Which is the 6 million you just talked about.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It's not directly tied to that, but we are projecting a future contribution required from DIA of $6 million, and that's generally generally related to installation of street cost. And again, that's strictly DIA cost, not not city of Denver General Fund.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. So the total cost then, is it 58.7?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That is strictly for the phase one of this project, which as I mentioned, is the lion's share of the infrastructure. There will be minor costs, additional costs over time, but we anticipate that those will be a number of years into the future.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. I appreciate you explaining all of that. I know you came to committee and sometimes, you know, the way the details are presented don't always give that full picture. So I needed to understand that as we're. Looking at all of these different bills before us tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I appreciate.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You're welcome. This is a complicated package with five agreements. And we were working on the closing today and we figured we can add up that there are actually 50 to 60 separate agreements and supporting documents that actually will be needed to support the final closing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And if you could just clarify one last thing. This is where Panasonic will be as well, correct?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yes. And these are the infrastructure costs that are necessary to make their site developable and they will actually be breaking ground on their side projected in October of this year.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'I have some questions.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'The second question, the I had received a letter of concern from a constituent in Harvey Park, and I wanted to be sure that a couple of these questions were asked. She was concerned about having a ban on outdoor our public use of tobacco products.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I want make sure it does not do that except in certain circumstances. And the last thing is, she was very concerned about since you can't give away tobacco products. Of having the vet, the vape and the electronic cigarets.'",

And I am just wondering if if you if you can't give it away, can you charge a penny or a nickel fee on each of I mean, this is a legal question, but I would like to know, is there a way'",

There is a definition in 2435 502 which refers you back to Title 1813 121, which defines cigaret tobacco product or nicotine product as follows A product that contains nicotine or tobacco or is derived from tobacco and is intended to be ingested or inhaled by or applied to the skin of an individual or'",
        "'speaker_10': 'any device that can be used to deliver tobacco or nicotine to the person inhaling from the device, including an electronic cigaret, cigar, cigarillos or pipe.

        "'speaker_10': 'But again, what we're doing tonight is essentially updating the definition of tobacco products. The original version of this law was enacted in 1998. A lot of products have come to market since then, which were not contemplated back in 98.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the intent is to update the definition to include all of this products and treat the products in a similar manner.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Just as a follow up on the latter one, then I'm not exactly sure from what the sampling has done since I am not a smoker at this point, and so I have not partaken of any of this. But can a person have a method to at least sell a puff?'",

But you didn't read how ours was different from it. What were the characteristics that are so different from what the state says?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What are we fixing in this city?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, again, there are sort of two components to the bill before you tonight. One is an update of the definition of tobacco products, which we just talked about. Mm hmm. The other piece of it is to remove some restrictions on advertising of tobacco products at retail.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Similar provisions have been struck down by the Supreme Court in the Lawler v Riley decision. So the intent of tonight's legislation is to address those those two issues. The state does not have a sampling prohibition akin to the city's sampling prohibition.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. You don't believe it would?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'and they asked to get a hold of them 60% of the time they were successful. And so we want to be able to address that. That is an issue. Yes, tobacco use is a preventable issue and it is a death from tobacco products is preventable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We want to make sure that this bill, when we looked at we originally looked at this as licensing. In looking at licensing, we realized that we were behind were behind the times in our own ordinances. And so in doing that, we realized that, one, we can preempt federal law in Supreme Court decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we wanted to eradicate those that language. But two, to add to update the universe because since 1998, there's been a lot of new products out there. We're looking at cigarillos, dissolvable electronic cigarets who could tobacco not listed in and so we want to do is update it because you know nine times out of ten you go'",
        "'speaker_4': 'into a shop, a lot of folks know what they're doing is not selling to anybody under 18. But there are some bad actors out there and we want to make sure that we are going after those bad actors because it's not right minors being given these products.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. And we want to protect that. So, you know, I was unaware of the email until today. And, you know, not to say that it doesn't count or doesn't matter, but we did have a public hearing committee. We discussed this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You invited a lot of folks to the table or you outreached with the business community, the Retailers Association. A lot of those folks, you know, at the end of the day, they were okay with actually updating our language is the license, the licensing scheme that generated a lot of the heartburn.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So, you know, the result of it is, is we're working on it with the task force at Denver Health and we're going to look at it closer and see what we can do to prevent the usage among youngsters with some of these products, but also to make sure that that we are doing our best in the city'",
        "'speaker_4': 'to understand who is selling these products, update that database because it is defunct, it is disorganized, and also to make sure that at least from our in our enforcement is up to par. And I think that's something that we discussed in that process.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So like I said, the intent is to clean up the bill and the intent is to clean up the universe, make sure that we're in stride with with regulation.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'And it was enough for me to to bring it up to you, councilman, and to, you know, whoever you're working with was staff. But the issue is the vamping stores are feeling like if they don't get a chance to, you know, we're hurting our whole industry, right?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If they don't get a chance to sample in there. And so I just wanted to make sure you were they were able to reach out to you, that you had a conversation with some of those folks. And if so, who who were those individuals?'",

        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Well, I guess there was a blog, an announcement that sent out. There's something. I had no idea. Had we known. We've been invited to the table. I'm the intent is isn't to hurt the shops itself, but it's to tighten up our laws to make sure that we are were up to date.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's the chapter 24 to point out. You want to make sure that we're up to date and that we are mindful of what products are out there. And we want to make sure that they're out of the hands of minors.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now, is this something that would prevent your business from succeeding? Is this something that will prevent you from sampling? Absolutely not. Charge a penny, charge a nickel, whatever it takes. You know, I can't go into a cigaret store and say, can I sample a cigaret?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can't. I can't do that with a lot of products. That's something that, you know, we worked out. But that's not the intent. The intent is to keep it out of hands of minors that our our laws. You can still sample.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Bricks. You have any other.'",

        "'speaker_5': 'I did to receive the emails today and once I read through the bill and realized these are fairly minor changes that do bring it up to date, I am in support of the ordinance.'",
