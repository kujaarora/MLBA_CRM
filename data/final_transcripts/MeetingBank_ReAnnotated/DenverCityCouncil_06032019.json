        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is proclamation number 19, Dashboard seven, for declaring the first Friday in June, June seven to be National Gun Violence Awareness Day, whereas every day 100 Americans die by gun violence. And on average, there are nearly 13,000 gun homicides every year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Whereas, in 2018, 885 men, women and children died by firearm in the state of Colorado, more than three quarters of which were suicides, which amounts to 15.5 firearm deaths per 1000 residents, the highest rate since 1986. And.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'WHEREAS, Denver's statistics show 3103 gun related offenses in 2018, including three 300 shootings, 63 cases of domestic violence, including a gun, 35 gun related suicides, 49 gun related homicides, and 1551 gun related violent crimes. And. Whereas, Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed with guns than people in other high income countries.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. WHEREAS, in the past 20 years, beginning with the horrific day at Columbine High School in Littleton in 1999, 14 students and one teacher have been killed in front range school shootings and almost three dozen injured in incidents at Columbine High School, Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Deer Creek Middle School in Littleton, Arapahoe High School in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Centennial, and most recently at STEM School Highlands Ranch. And. Whereas, protecting public safety in the communities they serve is the government's highest priority responsibility. And. Whereas, in January 2013, Hadiya Pendleton, a teenager who marched in President Obama's second inaugural parade and was tragically shot and killed just a few weeks later should be now celebrated her celebrating her'",
        "'speaker_6': '22nd birthday. And. Whereas, to help India and the hundred Americans whose lives are cut short and the countless survivors who are injured by shootings every day, a national coalition of organizations has designated June seven, 2019, the first Friday in June as the fifth National Gun Violence Awareness Day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Whereas, the idea was inspired by a group of ideas friends who asked their classmates to commemorate her life by wearing orange because hunters wear orange to announce themselves to other hunters. When out in the woods, an orange is a color that symbolizes the value of human life.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And. Whereas, anyone can join this campaign by pledging to wear orange on June seven to help raise awareness about gun violence and honor the lives of gun violence victims and survivors. And. Whereas, we as Council members renew our commitment to reduce gun violence and pledged to do all we can to keep firearms out of the wrong hands'",
        "'speaker_6': 'and encourage responsible gun ownership to help keep our city safe. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that the Council of the City and County of Denver declares June seven, 2019, to be National Gun Violence Awareness Day and encourages all citizens to support their local communities.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. I do have thoughts, and I'm going to do my best to honor our five minute time limit. It is wise when there is an open flame around your home that you keep combustibles at a safe distance, be it a gas stove, a lit candle, a cigar or a fireplace.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's prudent to be sure the flame does its job cooking, illuminating, igniting or heating without causing unintended, disastrous collateral damage. How often have we seen the results in an unexpected breeze from an open window, blowing a cloth curtain onto a nearby candle, a cigaret or a cigar accidentally dropped between the pillows of a sofa or a campfire'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that is not properly extinguished, resulting in catastrophic damage to property and devastating loss of life. We have chosen to not outlaw the use of fire except in extreme conditions. But over the years, federal, state and local governments have put forth continuing public education campaigns, as well as ongoing changes to our building codes that have dramatically reduced the'",

But as a society we have been very intentional about recognizing the potential for danger that is presents and doing everything within our power to reduce the frequency with which it negatively, negatively impacts our daily lives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In America today, we have open flames everywhere that some do not recognize as such. The firearms that many of our fellow Denver aides and fellow Americans hold dear for protection, for feeding their families and for recreation. Some 330 million of them sit smoldering as well, free of unexpected situations.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'These guns and rifles should benignly and holsters, drawers, safes, racks in closets awaiting the call to whatever legitimate use their owner intends. But nearby, wherever these firearms are standing, we have accelerants in close proximity that can turn lives upside down in an instant.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Accelerants like normal human forgetfulness that neglects to lock cabinets or empty chambers. Accelerants in the person of those with nefarious purpose in mind that intentionally misuse with evil intent. We have the hopelessness borne of an ever growing economic divide between rich and poor that is crushing the American dream, along with untreated mental illness and drug addiction that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'has an ever increasing percentage of our population ready to explode unpredictably at a moment's notice with the awareness burned into their brains, courtesy of social and mass media that firearms can help them ease the pain. Real or imagined that tortures them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Mr. President, we have not, as a society, done the same job keeping our communities safe from the unintended misuse of firearms as we have done in keeping it safe from the unintended misuse of fire. That has got to change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have children who have never felt safe, never feel out of the reach of gun violence. They're aware of mass shootings at their schools, mass shootings in movie theaters, mass shootings in shopping malls at McDonald's restaurants, not to mention the everyday individual gun related injuries and deaths that are a part of their daily lives.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I sat with my 14 year old granddaughter on election night in May as we awaited the returns, and I watched her break down in tears. As the news recounted the shootings that day at STEM school in Highlands Ranch.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I sat in the audience last week at Stephen Knight Center for Early Education at a forum focused on keeping our kids safe at school. And was stunned as a seventh grader read the will she had written while I'm locked down at her school a few weeks ago.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Her name is Ali, and she stepped up to the microphone, pulled out her cell phone and said, so this is my well, my best friend Blake gets $200 and my best wishes she gets to become a professional soccer player.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm sorry, but when it gets to the point where a seventh grader is writing her will because she believes dying in a school shooting is a real possibility, there is something very, very wrong. We have figured out a way to preserve our right to use fire without seeing families incinerated on a regular basis.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We haven't figured that out around firearms. That very important and very intentional conversation simply needs to take place. It needs to take place now at a city, state and federal level. Thank you, Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Absolutely. Thank you so much, Councilman Cashman. I will make this as quick as possible. This past weekend, I celebrated my friend Drew Leinonen, 35th birthday. Unfortunately, he did not. His life was taken almost three years ago at the Pulse nightclub shooting.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the time since, as Americans, we have seen on average, 100 other people per day lose their lives to preventable gun violence. In the time since my home state of Florida has proven time and time again that they are being held under a petri dish by the NRA.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'While in Colorado, we are still subject to mass shootings and gun violence. I feel fortunate to call home a place that represents me and my values. Denver has always had my back from stepping up to enact laws to protect the most vulnerable constituents and expanding health care reform to passing marriage equality before the rest of the country'",
        "'speaker_3': 'to fighting for gun it common sense gun reform keeping us all much more safe. Three years ago, shortly after Drew's funeral, I returned from Orlando to Denver. A month went by before I decided it was time to stop sitting in my own grief and rejoin society.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And since I lost one of my best friends to a senseless act of hate. I wanted to make sure other people didn't have to. I wanted to spare others from the pain that I felt, the pain that I still feel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I had to remind people why common sense gun laws are so important, even if it was just volunteering. I knew I had to do something. My very first action item was to create the website for the DRU Project, a nonprofit organization.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Dru's friends and I started to honor him. To date, we have given away over $30,000 in scholarships to LGBTQ youth and have created and distributed curriculum for Gay-Straight Alliances in Florida to continue honoring Drew's legacy. This guide has been downloaded all over the world at this point.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Drew started the first gay straight alliance at his high school in Seminole, Florida, when he was 17 and won the Holocaust Museum's Anne Frank Humanitarian Award for it. He was truly ahead of his time. His kindness and desire for inclusion and unity would be the encouragement we all needed to continue with his work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There is not one single person whom I encountered at his funeral who didn't refer to him as a best friend. That's the type of person he was. He had a best friend from high school, one from college, one from last Tuesday.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This didn't make him a flake. This made him a person whose warmth was undeniably strong. My second action item was to get involved with on demand action for gun sense. I've spoken at several of their rallies and testified against dangerous gun bills on their Andrew's behalf.'",

My third action items tenure just ended when I stepped down from running communications for the Matthew Shepard Foundation and fighting daily for those we have to protect from violence.'",

If you can, I encourage you to attend the West Orange event this year. It's Saturday, June 8th at Park Field Lake Park from 12 until three, and we're holding it in partnership with Councilwoman Gilmore.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'How is CPD looking at the they looking at citywide that 10%? So if we were to say somehow map this entire neighborhood to capture Adus and all properties were to get 80 use. That's way more than 10% for this local area.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But is that if if Kevin Flynn's district also has the same yellow coloring and it's part of the 10% does that is that what balances it out or what is the general vicinity that we're working with so that we know going forward?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm I think we've quantified the 10% that I've read in the blueprint, but I'm still reading from print, to tell you the truth. It is fairly new, but I would say that it's sort of it's a replacement for our areas of change, in our areas of stability, where we expect to see the most growth or the least'",

And they decided they wanted a new concept land use, which was single family with an accessory dwelling unit for their area.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'outright rezoning so folks can take advantage of, you know, just the development opportunity. But we need to figure out an incentive for affordable housing at some point.

        "'speaker_1': 'You will be use for those who have displaced because of because of I-70 and working with the global Elyria, Swansea Coalition and brother's redevelopment for those. And so it would be great if we can come together as a council CPD to come up with an incentive for affordable housing to use.'",

We're seeing these same things happen in the whole neighborhood and you know the rise in land value it it makes it an opportune time for an investor'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, I agree. I'll support this as well and I love to use it, but I agree with you. I'll talk about a voluntary. I would try to do a mandatory area rezoning. It has to be property owners opting in to from the experience I had.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'You're welcome. This is a second one. But let me get out of this 1/1 and.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this one is a legislative rezoning. It is for the University Park neighborhood, and it is to rezone from urban edge single unit D X to urban edge single unit D several properties in the university neighborhood university. I'm sorry, University Park neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's approximately 1051 properties, about 183 acres. The reason, again, the rezoning is from urban edge, single unit D X to urban edge, single unit D and the applicant. Here is Councilman Cashman. So what the effect of this rezoning would be, too, would be to remove the suburban house form from an allowed building use.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So a little bit of background. Back in 2003, there was a quick wins to that did address oversize homes or additions to homes. And then in 2010, we modified that. And then we, we developed the urban single unit, d-essex, which does allow both the suburban and urban house form.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Effectively turning back the clock to pre nine 2003 standards. And so this is an attempt to take us back to some of the wins in quick wins to where we were paying more attention to the form of the homes being built.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the suburban house formed the issue with suburban house forms that it's two and a half storeys or 30 feet in height or up to 35 feet if you have a wider lot. And it allows you to build up that form from the front of the lot to the rear of the lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a ten foot bulk plain on the side and then a 45 degree angle where the bulk plane curves over the property. And this gives you an idea of the form that could be created under that built building form.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So as you can see, it kind of doesn't fit with the area. So the Urban House form is that two and a half stories, but only in the front, 65% of the lot. And then a one story part of the house in the rear.'",
        "'speaker_7': '35% of the lot can only be one story or 17 feet. And this gives you an idea of what that bulk plane, it looks like for that building form and does fit a little bit better with the existing homes in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So. The existing zoning in the area is ESU X to the north is more single unit to the south more single unit. There is some multi unit to the east and to the west and then some mixed use and multi unit that's higher near the do campus to the west.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the land use is mostly single unit residential land uses, mostly through the center of the area, but again, multi-unit and retail off to the east and then the campus to the west. So some of these photos give you an idea of the existing homes in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some are single story, some are two story. The zone district does allow that two and a half story. So Pre-Application review of this started back in December of 2017. And then there was an extensive public outreach by the councilman and the neighborhood organization, and there were two meetings, some mailings, a couple of open houses and a survey'",
        "'speaker_7': 'on the web. And then the proposal was submitted in December of 2018. In April of this year, planning board unanimously recommended approval. And then this was seen at the Land Use Committee on April 23rd and then first reading on May 6th.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then we're here today. There is a letter of support by the University Park Community Council and eight other comments supporting the proposal. You know, their letters, one letter of opposition and one letter simply just asked some questions about the application.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So because this is a legislative rezoning, there are three criteria consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, and furthering the public health, safety and welfare. So the plans that are apply are Plan 2040, Blueprint Denver 2019 and the University Park Neighborhood Plan of 2008.'",

Current plan tells us to enhance our neighborhoods through high quality urban design and use urban design to contribute to economic viability, public health, safety and environmental well-being, neighborhood culture and quality of life. And to preserve the authenticity of our neighborhoods and celebrate the history, architecture and culture of our neighborhoods.'",

It has always been, according to the plan, a variety of architectural styles. But there was concern at that time that the new homes were not consistent with the overall fabric in terms of open space, tree canopy lot coverage, building orientation and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'building mass and building heights. So the plan did talk about single for the single family portions of the neighborhood, preserving the single family nature of the of the area and respecting the urban design and architectural character. And so the proposal to rezone from the assumed text to the study fits that very well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So staff does believe this is consistent with current plan 2040, Blueprint, Denver, 2019 and the University Park Neighborhood Plan by using a standard zoned district where furthering the uniform application of our zoned district citywide and by and we're furthering the public health, safety and welfare by implementing our plans and also furthering the general welfare of the University'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Again, I was against this because a lot of these rezonings involve a lot of displacement and gentrification. But I'm real good friends with this councilman at his district. So I trust his judgment and trust that he will do the right thing in regards to this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So with that being said, we're in favor of this. We need to maintain the character and and architecture of our neighborhoods. So. Yeah, we're in favor of this, I guess.'",

As Coloradans. And when we take the opportunity to go back in our history to reclaim our identity, it means and blends the old with the new in a way that's harmonious.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And the people come and have no respect for our culture whatsoever. They think we're a country with this world. Well, if we all of that and you all are distant, why are you here? So why are you here?'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And as discussed earlier, this was a part of our general meetings at three different general meetings of the neighborhood organization. We had a survey on the website, a couple of open houses. One of the reasons that I'm speaking here tonight is I live in the areas that were being considered for this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And one of the things that I want to kind of bring and draw your attention to is the idea of living within these icy canyons without access to sun exposure. One of the things that is the criteria in looking at this tonight is the public health and safety that was discussed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And as we look at work as a city to reduce our carbon, our drain on resources and reduce our carbon footprint, I think one of the things that we must consider is solar access for solar panels, heating homes, maybe even heating water and the ability to grow fruits.'",

Although we actively participated in the 2010 zoning code update process. We and CPD overlook the fact that the little X in the EFC would x zoned districts could be a problem.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We see the removal of the X as a tweak or as one planning board member said at our public hearing the correction of a mistake. Our goal is to take away the suburban house form option and return the protections granted by quick wins to the rights given to neighbors for privacy and a sense of openness in their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'backyards. It is not taking away square foot square footage potential, although square footage would not be impacted in this rezoning proposal. I'd like to repeat a comment made by another planning board member that zoning is not a property right and that maximizing square footage on a parcel has never been a property right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He added that it is not a diminishment of property rights if you even get ten or 20% less floor area. He termed our proposed rezoning a thoughtful, judicious way of matching the forms with the character of the neighborhood as we Gaza City.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that the notion that maximum square footage equals maximum value becomes more nuanced. Our outreach, our I.R.A. outreach included a mailing to every property owner in our ESU, Dickson districts. It explained the rezoning effort and included a link to a survey on our website.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We received 67 responses with 65 in favor. Councilman Cashman held two open houses with city staff, and presentations were given at three neighborhood general meetings. We appreciate CPD recognizing that this was an issue that needed tending, and thank Councilman Cashman for taking this on as a legislative rezoning.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'It is also my understanding that the total square footage of both home styles is similar. So given that I personally cannot see an advantage to building a longhouse as they are, it's unsightly and uninteresting in my opinion. I am in agreement with my R.A., the University Park Community Council, that the longhouse should not be allowed in the'",
        "'speaker_3': 'University Park neighborhood. In our fast changing city, I feel that we as its residents have a choice and how we want the city and our neighborhoods to look and feel. Allowing the building of long houses absolutely changes the charm of my neighborhood and therefore I speak in favor of eliminating the longhouse form in University Park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Next up, Jeannie Tubb.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Good evening, Jeanne Tubb.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Let's give you my address to 601 South Saint Paul Street on my street. I have two houses between me and a long house. I see a two story wall over my fence.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Scoring the entire length.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And its two properties are between mine and the other. The neighbor next to it has an ice field in their backyard with the kids play equipment all winter long. The person on the other side with the bank of Windows have had to put in new blinds, put up a screen for their barbecue area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You can see every square inch of their house in their backyard from the longhouse with the bank of windows.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'She has and she's written a letter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Jody Thompkins, about the effects on them. The other side of her is another long house, and she sees the back of the longhouse. So she feels she's in a canyon between two long houses, one that takes all her privacy to windows.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The other is.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A two story wall with very few features.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would be more appropriate for an apartment block. The neighborliness side of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has really been reinforced by the fact.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That I can pop my head over the fence and say, Hey, Kerri, do you want to trim this branch together? We've got this tree overhanging each other's property or he was just in hospital. How are you doing with a two storey rather long house?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You have to walk around to the other side and make an effort to figure out what's going on with your neighbor, who they are. So not only does it stop the filtering of light.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that sense of community that I feel is very important to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'University Park. There's a lot of.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Opportunity with building and prices and scrapes that can be done to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Continue to build long houses in our neighborhood, which I feel seriously affect the character of our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In the neighborliness, the light.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Filtering through back the various backyards and the feel of the neighborhood, as well as the type of trees that can be planted with about a five foot setback. You can plant some aspen or birch, but it also affects your design of greenery.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So those are some key factors that I would appreciate it if you would consider. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? All right. Seeing no questions. A public hearing for Council Bill 380 is closed. Comments by members of Council Council in question.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm appreciate the neighbors who brought this issue forward to me. And I've sponsored the legislative rezoning in hopes of preserving and reinforcing historic patterns in the university community that make backyards urban sanctuaries, where homeowners and their families can relax in the sun and tend to the gardens that put fresh food and fresh'",
        "'speaker_6': 'flowers on their tables. When this was first presented to me as as Mr. Phil said, we were reminded at Planning Board that maximizing your square footage is not a zoning right. However, it was something that I wanted to understand and wanted to judge the impact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And as Pat Cashen indicated on the suburban form, while you can build two stories front to back, that second story is narrower than the first because of the bulk playing on the urban form. You get to build the full width of your second story.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so the modeling that was done shows that the square footage is is right on similar if not actually a little bit greater with with the Urban House form. I believe the proposed rezoning is in the best interests, the best long term interests of this community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It preserves the ability for families to grow and provide the space in which they can enjoy the various generations living together. And it still preserves that neighborhood character. And especially, I appreciated Janey's comments about the ability to really grow community by connection with your neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So with that, I'm in full support of this rezoning and hope my colleagues will join me.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thanks, Mr. President. I hit the button right after you had asked me if there are any questions. I actually had a question. I don't know if you would allow that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. And maybe Councilman Cashman could be the person to answer this. As I looked at the two building forms and read through the staff report and the presentation and the letters that accompanied it, I was wondering. It seems to me that a long house can still be built in the Urban Forum.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But what you're saying is that the rear, the rear portion of the rear, 35% has to be restricted to one story. So the effect of it isn't to increase the backyard space or the lot or decrease the lot, decrease the light coverage, but to decrease the height in the rear.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Am I right about that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I don't. The term long house specifically has come to refer to those two storey homes. Build two stories front to back. The reason two to limit the growth to the construction to one story isn't so much to deal with light coverage because that's covered in other parts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But to increase privacy, since you don't have those long walls overlooking a backyard from the second story and it allows for more sunlight to filter through to the neighboring properties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So a house could still be as.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Long.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As an urban house could still be as long as a suburban house, but not as tall in the rear.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct. That's my understanding. I see. Teresa.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you. That's the clarification I was looking for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary. Raquel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Oh, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Black Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Espinosa. Swain. All right. Gilmore. Herndon. Can it. Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'New. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Madam Secretary, please. Because voting announced the results.'"
