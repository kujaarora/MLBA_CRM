    "Contract with LexisNexis Risk Solutions for Investigative Database Access.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. No items have been called out and under pending. No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? All right, Madam Secretary, if you please put the first item on our screens, which should be 485.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Councilmember CdeBaca, go ahead with your questions on 45.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you so much, Mr. President. For 85, this is the bill for a tool that I think is incredibly important to our democracy. Lexis-Nexis is kind of the way that we can look up legal information at multiple levels of government.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so my question here is, who is this contract making LexisNexis available to in the city of Denver? Sky Stuart mayor's office. We actually have, I think, Chief Ron Thomas here. He's probably making his way in from the other room.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm going to have him come and try and tackle that question. Here he comes. And perhaps you can explain which components. Go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you could keep your mask on, even at the microphone. Sure, please. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, what was the question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the question is, what applications are we using or what is this contract for? And who has access to it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is a suite of products that provide access to databases, law enforcement records, public records. It also provides crime mapping tools. And police officers have access to US city attorneys. It's unlimited access as far as licensing. So all city employees have have access to it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The Denver Police Department specifically has a policy regarding you can only you can only access it for law enforcement enforcement purposes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so how would individual council officers be able to get access to, like LexisNexis outside of our central team?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I honestly don't have the answer to that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Does it go through or who does it?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Guy Stewart might have an answer to your to that question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm guessing here. But it sounds to me like you are thinking about the Lexis-Nexis functions that are more with the city attorney's office uses to do research on bills and other things like that. The police department uses it for a completely separate purpose.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's a separate tool from LexisNexis. We do have LexisNexis licenses through the city attorney's office. That is a limited number of those. But that's something I could have the city attorney's office follow up with you on who has access.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Certainly, John Griffin would have access to those LexisNexis tools through the city attorney's office. But we can provide you with some information on that separate Huell, if that's what you're looking for. So our council office wants access to all of the tools within this suite if we are allowed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so I would want some clarification. He mentioned that it was unlimited licenses and you said it is limited. So which one is it? So the LexisNexis tool through the city attorney's office is a limited number of licenses.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I would have to ask Chief Thomas about this particular tool.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I can tell you that for the Denver Police Department, it is unlimited licensing. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So would it be available to council officers so we don't have to wait for the request when we're doing the legal research or using any of the tools in the suite?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sure that that could be made available.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Awesome. Thank you.'"

    "Contract with Mile High United Way for Small Business Emergency Relief Program.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. Anything else on this item, Councilmember? Okay. Um, Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens and that's 530. Councilmember CdeBaca, this one's also yours for questions.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. Is there anybody here who can speak to the Mile High, a united Way component of this? So I will do my best again. We have been asked not to send people down to the meeting unless bills are called out.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we got this call out too late tonight right before the meeting started to get anybody around here. So I'm going to do the best I can and we'll follow up if we need to. But go ahead and and I will try.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And and we make it we we do our call outs on Mondays so we can check in on Monday mornings for the call outs. But we are curious about the equity rubric here. We've been giving out small business relief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We haven't gotten a full account of what each business is getting and which businesses fall under the disadvantage business classification. We also haven't gotten the rubric that we've requested multiple times regarding how we prioritize equity in our small business relief.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can you speak to any of that? So we have sent out a number of materials about how prioritization is going on. I'm happy to present those again. And our report was put out on Friday that talks about the number of businesses that are female owned, minority and female owned and minority owned that was sent out to all'",
        "'speaker_3': 'of council on Friday. We have about 500 grants that have been made. 75% went to grants of businesses with less than 500,000 in annual revenue, and 65% went to either women or and or minority owned businesses. Half of the grants are more than half are sole proprietors or micro-businesses with five or fewer employees.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So that report has been sent out. I can resend it if that's helpful. That's not what we're looking for. That's the aggregated data. We're looking for disaggregated data by districts in a spreadsheet that shows us next to the business.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If it is classified as a disadvantaged business and how much each business is getting. That is not data we've gotten and we've made several requests. And so I would like to make sure that going forward, that's something that we're getting because the disaggregated data is critical for us.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And that report has listed the individual businesses that have been awarded to your point, that does not identify whether they're disadvantaged. So I will pass that request on. It does identify the council district for each of those 500 businesses and the amount request on.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, thank you.'"

        "'speaker_0': '534.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. It does. Just to comment tonight. As our nation is appropriately focused on the history of racism and its impacts on black lives. The bill that is before us tonight in front of you is the resolution approving a contract that helps to mitigate harm experienced by another community that has also faced bias and exclusion'",
        "'speaker_6': '. If we think about the thriving city that we lived in prior to COVID. Hotel workers, restaurant workers, janitors, cleaning buildings, window washers, many of the jobs that were impacted during the crisis, they were held by those who are left out of many of the systems in our country because of their immigration status or because of how they've'",
        "'speaker_6': 'been categorized by the federal government. These folks pay taxes and they helped our city thrive, but they're now unable to access the relief that has been set up for other workers. They can't access unemployment insurance or they've been excluded from the CARES Act.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, these workers face the same challenges with housing, with food, getting a cell phone bill paid so that they can keep in contact with their loved ones, their doctor or their employer to be called back to work. So the city is investing in a left behind worker fund that will help $1,000 per eligible worker to help them'",
        "'speaker_6': 'with their emergency COVID relief. This bill was a partnership between the mayor's office, the Human Rights and Community Partnerships Team, and my office, and many community partners who really helped to bring this issue to the forefront and tell us the stories of the impacted workers.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I want to thank the immigrant defense table that was represented by the Colorado People's Alliance, by SEIU Local 105 and by together Colorado. And I want to help the folks who created the Left Behind Worker Fund. We are not the first ones at this party.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Left Behind Worker Fund was put together by two co advisors, Marc Newhouse and Katrina van Gas, and I would like to thank them personally. This is a passion project for them. They're not paid for this work, but they attracted funders together and said, Let's pool our resources to make an impact.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Foundations like the Denver Foundation and the Rose Foundation and the Open Society Foundation put their dollars in to help attract our dollars and to help make a bigger impact for workers. And so I would like to urge other local governments in the metro area and across the state to consider supporting their residents who've been left behind from'",
        "'speaker_6': 'federal and state programs, just like Denver's doing. And I'd like to encourage other foundations to continue to grow their investments. And lastly, you can contribute individually to the Left Behind Worker Fund. If you got one of those CARES checks and maybe you didn't do anything special to earn it, and you were able to keep your job through'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this crisis and you didn't need it to pay your bills. Think about contributing a portion of it to workers who were left behind. You can find a link on their website. I want to thank my colleagues, each of whom took time to get briefed on this program, which was a direct file.'",

So I want to thank all the partners who made this possible and say, I'm very proud of our city for standing in the gap'",

And along with Councilwoman Torres, this earlier comment, may I pray that Dakota recipients don't need this assistance because our Supreme Court will honor their role in our economy and in our communities.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. I wanted to encourage my colleagues to challenge DPR, not to put this kind of agreement in front of us. Next year there is a short fuze on this agreement. Skyline Park is our downtown park. That is often a space where a lot of our unhoused individuals congregate.'",

They have taken the initiative to activate this park without this going to an RFP and creating equal access for other members of the community, other community organizations to have access over deciding what happens at'",

        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President, because we have so many people who aren't typically engaged in city council. I want to also bring to your attention this is a little bit of the education that Councilmember CdeBaca was talking about. Our job, one of our core jobs in city council is land use and planning and the relationship between land use'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and how to get to and from it. So basically we have a committee called Ludy and that stands for land use, transportation infrastructure and inner urban core. It is tough to get around. However, you choose to get around by car, by foot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And and so as a city, we are prioritizing where we're rethinking the way we get around our city. We have the opportunity we have the the the potential to totally reshape. So 70 right now, 73% of Denver workers commute to and from their job by single occupant vehicle.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And particularly downtown, we have options because RTD may come back soon in full shape. You know, RTD, it's a hub and spoke model, but it's hub is downtown.

        "'speaker_5': 'I talked about how we all need the freedom to get from A to B, regardless how we choose to get there. So why am I bringing all this up with Skyline Park? I would say I am frustrated with Skyline Park because the vendors that would be activated by this contract constantly and consistently use the bike lane and'",

        "'speaker_5': 'By foot. By a wheelchair. By bike. And so I, I, I hope that if this were to be approved, that we would strongly consider ways for vendors to get their their stuff to and from wherever they're vending without having to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To have cyclists and pedestrians constantly dodge parked vehicles on the sidewalk or in the bike lane or have cyclists go into traffic. That's the whole point of protect the bike lane is to keep cars where they are and keep bikes in a in a safer place.'",
