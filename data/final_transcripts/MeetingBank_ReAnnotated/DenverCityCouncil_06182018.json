The property is about two and a half acres, so there's a 40,000 square foot building used for marijuana cultivation and extraction. The request is to rezone from I am x three, which is industrial context to mixed use zoning with a three storey maximum height to I.A.'",

The existing marijuana cultivation use is considered plant husbandry, which is not allowed under the existing. I am extreme that that use is considered non-conforming and the proposed rezoning would bring that into conformance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The property is surrounded on three sides by the same ix3 zoning and to the north by the EIA. The requested zoning to the south across 38th Avenue is a mix of single unit and two unit residential zoning. You can see the surrounding uses mostly industrial in the area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Across Holly Street is the District two police station and then again, south of 38th is a mix of residential uses. You can see the subject property there in the center and then some of the surrounding buildings around it.'",

There was no public comment at that meeting, went to the Liddy Committee on May 8th.

Holly Street is an industrial collector and 39th Avenue is a non-designated local, both consistent with the proposed zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The third plan is the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan from 2000. The Park Sale Plan calls for keeping a separation between the industrial uses north of 38 and the residential uses south of it.

The definition of area says it is compatible with adjacent residential and this rezoning would not put a directly adjacent to residential.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There would still be some Annex three between the residential south of 38th and this property. And it would help act as a a transition from the residential to the Annex three to eye to eye, be the heavy industrial further north north of the railroad tracks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So staff finds the proposed rezoning consistent with the adopted plans and the first criterion met. The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of the zoned district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and facilitating the continued existence of a building or a business in an existing building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds the proposed rezoning is justified by change conditions. When this property was rezone to I Annex three in 2010 as part of the citywide rezoning and adoption of the new zoning code.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'Then in June of 2010, with the citywide rezoning, the property's zoning was changed to IMX three, which doesn't allow plant husbandry. The use continued as legal non-conforming and the non-conforming status has been maintained with great expense and effort.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'The non-conforming status creates an increased administrative burden on the applicant and on the city. The non-conforming status gets flagged every time the applicant goes to the city for any sort of interaction, whether it's building permits, inspections or licensing.'",

I made a formal presentation to the Northeast Park Health Coalition and their letter of support. A letter of support is in the staff report. We attended a Greater Park Hill community meeting.'",

The goal of this rezoning is to remove administrative burdens and create certainty. The operations at the property are going to continue unchanged.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have invested approximately $8 million into this facility thus far. We were in front of the Board of Adjustment because the building department thought our use permit would only let us use a small part of the space. We have a 43,000 square foot building, though that variance was granted.'",

Through careful compliance efforts, hard work by our architect, engineers, lawyers and compliance staff, we manage our nonconforming status.'",

And these are the same folks in the industry who sit by silently and have our sons and daughters locked up in jail without any moral authority to even speak upon it. As they gather up millions and millions of dollars of the blood, sweat and tears of our people.'",

And yet nothing is said about what's happening right here in the city county of Denver, where they're proposing to do this to get rich on the misery of our people.'",

No voice, no reason to look the other way, because the real truth is this industry is putting money in your pockets to finance your reelection.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Now tell me a lie. Tell me I'm lying. Jolene taking no money from the marijuana industry to get reelected. And then you vote for this speaks of corruption. So I'll close with this king. One, said the. Truth. Like a mighty river.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'There is not. The air is governed by a floor area ratio instead of a height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So I want to ask the representative, maybe, Mr. Daly, if you can come forward. So there's an operating business in the facility. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Since 2010.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And. The nonconforming use is something that. Requires an annual application for their permit or. Help me understand why that's been an issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. So any time we go to change anything, for example, adding a new grow room or using our trim area differently, whatever under the normal permitting that we're going for, we'd be permitted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To do the same footprint of the existing building. That is.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'We do not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So it's really just to not have to go through that brain damage each time you want to do something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right. It's it's extremely costly and time consuming.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I think that's the only other question I have. This is very helpful.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. From CPD, that five three planning board vote. What was that about? Yes. Yes. Three of the from what they said at the meeting, three of the planning board members had concerns that the request did not meet the fifth criterion consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They felt that the. The buffer or the transition between the residential south of 38th and the industrial area was better served by the larger I am x3. That was more appropriate for that context and and the district purpose and intent.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If we were to vote no on this, the operation wouldn't cease. It would just continue to be hampered.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A bit by regulation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct? Yes. They can continue indefinitely as a non-conforming use with the restrictions and burdens that have already been mentioned, but they would not have to leave or close the business. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Cashman are currently.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just heard. I'm sorry. I forgot your name. You said that the facility opened in 2010. Yes, sir. And there was nothing. Are you the owner of the building?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not. Mr. Moreland. Douglas. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're the owner of the business. That is correct. I am. The business opened in 2010. That is correct. And do you represent Mr. Moreland?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We're here with authority from the Moreland family.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When when did when did Mr. Moreland buy the property?'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Or just recently. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So you saw the business opened under the prior owner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Now, in 2010 is when the zoning code was changed, so this immediately became a non-conforming use. Scott, could you explain the timing?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. So this mindset is the business went in in early 2010. Okay, the new zoning code was adopted summer of 2010. So it was June, a matter of months after months opened and when the zoning changed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So it became non-conforming almost immediately after it opened. Do you know and I don't blame you if you don't stop it. Do you know how many nonconforming uses exist right now in the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I do not.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Who would it be?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Like dozens. Or could it be hundreds? Marijuana specific? No. All non-conforming users.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Hundreds?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, hundreds.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So would the fact that a nonconforming would we consider it as a justifying circumstance in all cases of any non-conforming use to change that to a zoned district that would permit. That non-performing used to be an allowable use?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Or do you see circumstances where that would not be the case?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, I could imagine circumstances where that would not be the case. If it's a sane industrial use embedded in a residential area, right, there would be a non-conforming use.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You wouldn't want to resort to an industrial.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The changes in the area would notate against zoning to industrial.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the cultivation facility were to. Well, let me let me back up. The extraction the right to do extraction there was obtained subsequent to the 2010 zoning code. When did that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Occur? 2014, I believe.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And what kind of process that required a zip c?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. A special zoning permit with special exception review. Right.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. If that facility were to close with this new zoning, aia in right in the middle of an image three zone. What types of uses would be permitted there that might not be permitted otherwise under its current zone?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have the full list of uses. If you have a couple examples, I would help you out. Yeah. Besides the obvious plant husbandry. I believe it allows more manufacturing uses than the iron actually does. It does not allow the residential that the Annex three does.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, yeah, there's a difference in.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Immediately across 39th.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Avenue to the north.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is the idea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If this building were magically overnight.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'To move a block.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'North, this wouldn't even be an issue. Correct. Okay. That's that's all the questions. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. That's a question for the business operator. And I was really going to comment on it. But since you're here, I might as well ask one of the one of the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Opponents.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That spoke spoke about sort of the you know, I don't expect you to solve all the problems of of us as a society. But there is a we do know demographically there is a bigger big difference between ownership of these businesses versus the population in general and the lack of minority representation in these things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You are now obligated to produce a community engagement plan. Do you do you think that there is at least some some daylight or opportunity there in a future community engagement program to maybe make some inroads to sort of that might help introduce or create opportunity for local residents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To work in the facility? Or are you talking about sort of just in work or train or education.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or leadership or there could be so many different things very open.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But. So our company has about 20% of our roughly hundred employees are minority at the moment. And several years ago we had engaged in the community by growing organic vegetables and giving them away at the community center just down the road on Holley Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that was very successful and a lot of gratitude from the people there. The media ultimately disallowed us from growing organic vegetables in our backyard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's that was all I was going to do is in my comment, sort of expressed my my, my desire that you you always maintain that that level of creativity and openness and see what you can do to sort of address just sort of historic inequities that persist in the neighborhood that surrounds you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely. I think, you know, collectively, our organization, one of the reasons we undertook this business was because of the inequity in in terms of the drug war and how many particular people of color have been locked up. I think that's one of the things we're trying to change through this business.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we've been very active. My partner and I were just in Washington last week for three days meeting with several justices on that very matter.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's that's a great response. And that is one that was one aspect to this. But one part of that problem was the lack of opportunity. And so absolutely, let's hopefully you can help complete that cycle and reverse that trend.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, thank you, Mr. President. This question is for Scott. So looking at the PowerPoint presentation, it shows that this site is pretty much surrounded by IMX zoning. And typically the planning department does not like having zoning. That is not consistent.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So were there other considerations besides the EIS zoning that could have been? Used as opposed to AA.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, first the idea was the zone district requested by the applicant. And so we process the application that they submit. But as far as what would work, there is probably the best zoned district that would work for their needs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Plant husbandry would also be allowed in the EIB, I believe, but that's the heavier industrial, so that would be less appropriate and then it would be allowed in some of the open space zoning, which obviously would not be appropriate in an industrial area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So it really was. Kind of by default that I really kind of made the most sense.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Yeah. For what their needs were. I think the idea was the most logical choice.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So even though you all typically don't like changing zoning, that's not contiguous to one another. Mm.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well it is contiguous with the air to the north across 39th Avenue. But yeah. Ah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This map isn't showing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sorry. Yeah, the the line is 39th Avenue between the three. So yeah, it is contiguous with the air to the north. It would be contiguous with the air to the north if approved. And yeah, we don't have any longer, we don't have minimum area requirements or these contiguity requirements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we evaluate the request against the five criteria. And as I said, we found all five criteria have been met. So we recommend approval.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So under the IEEE zoning, if they want to expand, they would have the ability to do that. They just have to go through the process with exercise and license to be able to expand their building beyond the current footprint.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. I haven't looked at. You know, all the the regulations, the setbacks and my coverage and all of the things in the air. But yet, presumably, they would be allowed to expand the building under the ACA if they got approval from exercise in license.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. All right. That concludes our questions for members of council. And the public hearing is now closed. Comments by members of Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Herndon. Thank you, Mr. President. I've been in this building. I've toured it. I'm very familiar with this because as it was mentioned, it's right across the street from Police District two or Northeast Park. You'll have their community meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so this is something that I am supportive of. We have an owner who wishes to do the right thing by put himself in conformity. It will not be an impact to the community if this council would ever want to have a conversation about marijuana and its impact on communities of color.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I've been speaking about that since we legalized it. So anyone want to join me in that conversation? Let's have it. But for this sake, we're having a conversation about changing the zoning, and I believe this is something we should support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, I just wanted to thank Mr. Markovsky and the rest of the ownership team for hearing my concerns and the things that I expressed at LUDI and doing additional or seemingly doing additional outreach and coming together with a complete for me, a truly complete application.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And with that, I will be supporting this rezoning. All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I don't believe that I can support it. I find that it does not meet some of the criteria despite the recommendation of planning. I agree with some of the planning board comments that were related to us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'In fact, I don't I believe the current zoning actually conforms to the neighborhood plans better, particularly where it calls for a buffer area between the industrial and residential uses in the neighborhood. Here, we're moving an industrial zone closer to the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The other three citations from the Park Hill Neighborhood Plan all are met by the current operation and it's with its current non-conforming zoning. The 2010 zoning overhaul actually violated blueprint Denver's area of stability an area of stability criterion where.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Let.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Me let you get back to it. Where said that it may be appropriate to change the zoning to better match existing uses. In 2002 and then in.'",
        "'speaker_10': '2010 we changed the zoning to make it non-conforming. So we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Actually the 2010 rezoning didn't meet the criteria, but there obviously had to have been a purpose to it or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We wouldn't have put the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The IMAX three in that location. We wanted to have that buffer with the neighborhood. So I agree with the dissenting votes on the planning board, and I vote no on this. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. See no other comments. It's been moved and seconded. Madam Secretary.'",

It's also the case that we need to really strengthen the first and last mile access to folks within the neighborhoods, being able to access the full advantages of the economic opportunities for work around the cities'",
        "'speaker_10': '. How do we do this seamlessly? How do we recognize that this is an asset? How do we make this an asset both esthetically, economically and culturally for the historic statistic? To Statistical Globeville neighborhood. I want to end this by saying the historic statistical Globeville neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I wish that the Planning Department would always add historic and not just statistical. There are 78 statistical neighborhoods in Denver and many more historical neighborhoods, and I hope this project will help reflect that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Ms.. And Elizabeth. All right. This concludes our speakers questions by members of Council Councilwoman Kenney.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think my first question is probably for someone from the ascendant team. I wanted to ask about the total acreage of the your proposed development, broader than just this stationary plan and the total potential number of units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's a couple of references to the potential in the developer agreement, but if one of you could just summarize that for me, please. Acreage and total potential number of residential units that are being discussed. There's a reference in a document.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If someone wants to just read it, that's okay to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hi. So the total property is 41.5.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Acres and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Current developed developable acreage totals about.'",
        "'speaker_3': '30 acres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're looking per the IAP at.'",
        "'speaker_8': '2800 residential units in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Total for the site. Great. And can you just. Do you know what percentage of the total area is represented in this rezoning? We've re zoned several other portions. So I just wanted to have you what is it, about 50% initial rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There's 12 acres of the 41 that have been resound. So I think we're.'",
        "'speaker_3': '30% as kind of represented. That's a rough estimate here on the on the stand by, about 30%, 30% has been risen. 60% were were asking for a rezoning. And can you clarify, this is the last rezoning for this this proposed area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, for this for this full 41 A.C.P.O. And then if someone from the city staff could answer the next questions, please. There is a pending bill footing the bill for 43. I believe it is the developer agreement. And I wanted to ask about the legal relationship between this zoning and the pending bill.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where is staff? Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hello, Councilman. Jill Jennings goal at Community Planning and Development. I just want to make sure I understood the question. Are you asking about the legal sort of tie between the rezoning and the development agreement? Yes. So I have Brad back with me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The city attorney's office who may be better able to answer.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm Brad, back with the city attorney's office. And I'm I'm not quite sure what you're asking.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if this rezoning is approved, is it contingent in any way, shape or form on the developer agreement that is pending and not before us tonight?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I think we're presenting all of these at the same time for that particular reason.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Number 443 is not. We don't have a pair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. So the order in which. No, no, no. So the question is, is if 422 fails, is it contingent on the others for 43 in the other things that are in a block here, are they are.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Could could this developer redevelop this if this zoning is approved? Could they redevelop under this zoning even if they had developer agreement fails?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No. I think if the if the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If the rezoning is not approved, we would withdraw opposite question.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sorry, I'll start over. Yeah. If anyone else wants to jump in. So this zoning, let's imagine it's approved tonight. Okay. And let's imagine that the developer agreement is not approved. Can they build? It's my understanding, as it was presented to me, that there are certain land use rights in the developer agreement that are not unlocked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so those those other terms are met. So what I want to understand is what is the relationship between the two, between the zoning and the developer agreement? We have a presentation that focused on just one thing, but there is a much bigger package that we're in.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so you're going to find, I think, in the question, answer that to the extent that we have shared this with the world as to linked pieces of legislation, we need to talk about them as two linked pieces of legislation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I'm looking for someone who can help describe that, particularly for our community. I, I feel like I understand it, but I want to make sure that I'm hearing and you guys are putting it in your words, how the two the two pieces relate to each other.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The approval of the second.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Rezoning is a condition precedent to sentence obligation under the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So if you don't if you don't approve it, then the development agreement doesn't spring. But.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sorry. This is Jill again. But I do believe if you were to approve the rezoning and not approve the development agreement, yes. That you would have changed their zoning and they would not be bound to the terms under the development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There would still be an infrastructure master plan in place for the property guiding the overall infrastructure and guiding that element of the property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I think that gets to the answer. Thank you very much. Can you please can someone please describe to me what the terms of the development agreement state with regard to affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, Councilwoman Connie Chung, Doug Salbi, housing manager with the Office of Economic Development. The development agreement currently extracts from the developer in any affordable housing build as chosen as a build alternative plan in alignment with the ordinance on the linkage fee that 25% more of the units will be extracted on any vertical development for units on'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the site. If there is a choice of paying the linkage fee instead, then 25% more of the linkage fee will be paid.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And does anything in the agreement require the building of a single unit of affordable housing? Or could they fulfill the agreement solely by paying money?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They could. To answer your first question, there is no requirement to actually build affordable housing or build any type of hotels or any of the commercial developments that may be proposed on the site. And there is there is the choice that they could pay the fee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then in history. Can you recall, have there been other large redevelopment agreements where the department has negotiated agreements that required the building of affordable housing as part of those developments? Such an agreement is is legally possible, is the question I'm asking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Under the previous ordinance, which called for units under the IATO ordinance, there were the allowance of affordable housing plans for large scale developments as part of that ordinance, in which case there was specific affordable housing requirements put in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Currently, we operate under the linkage fee ordinance, which calls to be paid by the developer, or they can choose a build alternative plan for whatever build is going on industrial, commercial or residential. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well, it does, but I don't think it's complete. The linkage fee ordinance also includes an option for otherwise negotiated plans. Correct? Correct. If you are exempt from the ordinance, if you are under an otherwise negotiated, affordable housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If you're under an otherwise negotiated affordable housing plan, you are exempt from the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I just want to close the loop. It would have been legally possible to require the construction of affordable housing on this site as a term of an agreement. If there was a negotiated agreement where both parties signed it, that that would have satisfied they could have legally satisfied the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It could in past plans that has been negotiated with a subsidy of funding from the OED.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. My last question is for the planning department. You've mentioned several adopted plans, the Globeville plan. In the 41st and Fox plan, there's approximately 13 mentions of affordable housing in the first, 41st and FOX Plan. There's also a number of them in the Globeville plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In your analysis of the conformance of this zoning with adopted plans, did the Planning Department specifically analyze the language in these plans related to affordable housing as it relates to the development agreement that was negotiated? So was the analyst.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Did you all do a point by point analysis of the language in the plan and the development agreement that was negotiated with regard to affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Jill Jennings. Gorelick We acknowledge that the plan discussed the importance of affordable housing and felt that that was an incredibly important need, which is why we had the developer engage with the Office of Economic Development to have conversations around affordable housing for this site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is it your recollection, I guess, that any of those plan references related the payment of fees? Did you guys is that your recollection?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I don't believe that was the case because both of the plans were adopted prior to the change in practice related to the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what would you describe the gist of the language plan about the importance of affordable housing? What were what was the plan talking about when it when it brought up affordable housing? What what did it value? And what was it pointing to?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So generally speaking, obviously, this is next to a transit corridor and we want to ensure that there is a mix of housing for different incomes and different populations at our transit stations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And did you do any analysis about how the payment of fees that would not result in units might impact that that goal language terms of conformance with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I believe that already looked a bit at some of the fee numbers on their site and what that might generate. So I might.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Turn it over. But the plan doesn't relate to money. The plan relates to right there.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The plan talks generally about the provision for affordable housing, but does not put a requirement for a certain number of units.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I just want to clarify that the plan we agree at least that the plan does not talk about funding. It talks about mixed income housing. Okay. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Kenny. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is for Graham. Then if you can come to the microphone. So my my first question is about. Whether you're looking at master planning the site or are you looking to develop any of the actual structures yourself, or are you just looking at building the infrastructure that then attracts other developers to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'come to the site to build on it?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, Councilman Ortega, this is what really is the next step that really lays out the infrastructure for this site, the roads it has streets section. So it's much more detailed than what we had gone through before with the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This ownership groups desire is not is not going to be to develop vertically. So this group is mainly laying the foundation for others to come and either master plan the site in terms of going vertical, the plans that we have in place pretty much lay the foundation so they there's not too much they can bury in terms'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of street grids. So that is the plan is to have somebody come in and do the master development and vertical development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And in doing so, then you would sell the land to those developers that would build on.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And are you looking for one master builder or are you looking at multiple selling off multiple sites?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One one developer, one purchase here would obviously be the the most, most the best path forward versus multiple developers.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Let me see if we have another question for you. Yes. One of my questions about the the acreage, let me go to Chris Nevitt. Chris, if you can come forward, I want to ask some questions about the infrastructure master plan, which I'm not clear.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Is that the same as the next step study or are those completely different?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hi. Chris Nevitt, the city's top manager. Councilwoman, I'm not the expert in the infrastructure masterplan. I may call on my colleagues from CPD on that, but then the next step study is focused on figuring out how we can get to a more precise configuration of the particularly the transportation infrastructure that's necessary to serve the area, get to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'some concept level pricing, and also figure out a plan of finance so that we can actually construct all those components. So the infrastructure master plan lays out a lot of stuff with respect to the street grid inside the area, particularly with respect to the the parks in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a big contribution to regional parks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's specific to the site that we're rezoning tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The infrastructure master plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And does that include the other 12 acres? Yes. Okay. So the next step study is outside the boundaries. So let me ask a couple questions about that. You keep talking about transportation, although we know there is a serious drainage problem in this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So number one is this within the Utah Junction Outfall area?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Boy, you are stumping me if you're asking me for the name of it. But there is a a a drainage master planning process that is focusing on all of the basins that drain into the Platte River there, and particularly go through Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because as you know better than anybody, there are serious flooding and inundation issues in the Globeville area. And so this master planning study, the the drainage study for Globeville is focusing on all the sources of water that that that converge there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. So we know that there is one road into the site, which is Foch Street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, that's not true. There's two roads from downtown.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We're not counting that. We do not want to see traffic go through Globeville to get to this site. That community is going to be inundated with traffic for the next five years, dealing with the construction of I-70 and National, Western and Washington Street and a ton of other private development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So to say that we're going to put traffic on 45th Avenue and put that traffic through, we're trying to keep truck traffic out of the neighborhood right now because right now trucks are routing through that street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, ma'am. Let me answer when we correct. Yeah, let's get to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's get to the question because we've got a long list behind.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So. So. Is there expectation that Fox Street becomes a four lane roadway?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, ma'am.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because it's a white street. But it's it's one street into this site that 2800 units is a part of many other developments that have already been approved by this council. Two, to funnel into this what you refer to as Fox Island because of the limited access to this area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so how do we expect to move traffic in there? And until we fix the first mile, last mile that and Elizabeth talked about, people are still going to drive their cars in this city. And we know there's a RTD corridor there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But so you're saying. The plan talks about or the rezoning talks about addressing the bike and pedestrian connections. But we're going to bring all that traffic in on two lanes, one in and one out to the site unless we see the next step.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Study out a new road. Right. Which has been talked about. So can you just speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, ma'am. So just to go backwards for a moment, with respect to the 45th Avenue connection, we've made it very clear all the way along that we have no anticipation of 45th Avenue and the connection through the main street of Globeville being any different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, better, nicer than it is today, but not carrying more traffic. We're not going to reconstruct that road to carry more traffic. That road will be reconstructed to be a nicer roadway for that community. With respect to Foch Street, the anticipation is not that Foch Street will become, you know, a four lane superhighway, as it was.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Through the major collector. That's why I'm asking the question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. But but that's not our anticipation reconstructing. And these are all subjects that the next step study will address, reconstructing the very suboptimal interchange of Park Avenue, 38th Avenue, Foch Street, and the on and off ramps for I-25.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's a key important move. And another key important move that the next step study will address, as you pointed out, is creating a third connection to the area on the northwest, and that is memorialized in the infrastructure master plan currently and will be explored in more detail in the next step study.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I think I just want to add a gloss. If we do everything business as usual in this area, we will not be able to accommodate the traffic that might ordinarily be associated with this kind of development.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a mess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Today. We will not.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do business as usual. Yeah. Understood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I have one more question. And this is I'm not sure who can probably someone from the planning department. Kyle, do you know if there are any court setbacks that address shading because 12 storeys is going to be allowed on the north end and you've got I-70.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So if we have 12 story buildings, you're going to have a lot of shading. And so when it snows, you're going to have more ice on the highway. So can you just address that issue?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I don't believe there are serious setbacks for buildings.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And do we have setbacks at all from the edges, from our 12 story buildings?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just nonexistent. I'll let him answer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Jeff Brazel With any plan in development, the ANP envisions a road that parallels the interstate. Okay, so the road is, I believe, is about 65 to 67 feet of total right away. And then there's a buffer on top of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right up against the right up against the seatbelt right away. So while the underlying zoning would allow zero LA line development, there's an actual wide roadway right there.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that would address that concern for. Okay. Just one last one. And this is for. I'm sorry. I thought I had. This is for Mr. Dennis. Do you have any intention of requesting tax increment financing for the site?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At this time, we do not have any plans to request tax increment financing for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it's not totally.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I mean it just yeah. That's that's that's a next step that, you know, a developer could could definitely take that path.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Mr. Venizelos.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Come back.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You might not stay in that for a while.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to follow up on him.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Councilwoman Cain answers questions about the development agreement. Does the development agreement require you to build affordable housing? I want to just clarify that in my own mind.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It does not require us to build affordable housing on the site.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You plan on building affordable housing in this project?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're not the vertical developer. But what we've said all along is we are very committed to seeing that affordable housing comes to the site. When we when we undertook our last rezoning, you know, we were under the dijo.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And since that time, you all passed linkage fees. So we want to go above and beyond linkage fees. We went to OSD and said, we see we don't want to be an unaffordable city. That's bad for business. So we went to OPD and said, we want to do more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They said, Well, you can pay more in. Money's great. So we've agreed to pay more. And the bigger picture is economics. We've talked to every single affordable housing developer in town and. We have such a better opportunity to have affordable housing at our site in this neighborhood than any other place in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're not looking to cap it by saying we're going to build 80 units of affordable housing. We look at this as this is the the basement. And we have. Unlimited opportunity for workforce housing at this site based upon the economics of our land value, nobody else in the city is going to have the land value that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we have had the opportunity to create as much affordable, attainable, diverse housing businesses, fresh food markets, businesses, so other neighborhoods don't have that opportunity.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It sounds like it'd be easy to commit to affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With that kind of description.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You're easily I don't know, one of the developer agreement didn't address this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And why? Why there's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Not a commitment more of a commitment to affordable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Housing. We don't want to tie up the future developers. We're not the experts on vertical affordable housing. So we didn't want to restrict another developer coming in and said they're going to do X times more than what's required.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Doug, what about you? I mean, as Doug said, always. Thank you. Doug, what about any requirement at all for affordable housing about this project other than buying out of it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What's the question? I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is there going to be any requirement for affordable housing to be built with this project? Or is it just going to be a fee, additional fee that's going.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To be bought out for the development agreement? There can be the additional fee paid in the linkage fee that goes directly to support affordable housing, you know, through our investments. Or if there is a build alternative plan chosen, then there will be 25% more units extracted from the actual build alternative that's proposed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And this does not preclude any future investment. If only affordable housing development is proposed on the site. The OED would be looking at that as we do our projects to invest in those directly and extract the units directly, contractually.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe outside of this project. But. Right. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr..'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You know. You know, let me just follow up just because you've mentioned percentages. What is the actual payout? So don't mention and don't mention a percentage. Tell me, what per square foot will they be paying out? So it's very clear.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To the public. It depends on what's built on the site in. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So there's 2800 units can be realized here. What if there's just.'",
        "'speaker_4': '13 to 1500 to 20, 300? I would say if it was a full build out under the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let's go with the 1500 number. What per square foot are we looking at?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Probably about under that. Maybe I was looking at the numbers more in the improved mobility plan of an.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adventure for folks who are listening, folks who are even here in. If they were doing it under the affordable housing link it free plan would be a buck 50 a foot. So what would they be paying for? Regular residential?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well for the improved mobility plan. Should those go through, it would be $6.9 million. Okay. Of the total development of the site was projected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. 6.9 million for transportation and then for affordable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the linkage fee today, the fee does go up. It's adjusted annually starting July one. But currently, any multifamily residential development that's built under the international building code pays a dollar 60 per square foot. Okay, so we're paying 25% more.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They would be paying $2 per square foot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. That's what that's what I wanted to say. So everybody gets that. So two bucks a square foot for residential. All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Kyle, could you tell us what was the reason for the single dissenting vote at the planning board? It's not meant. It's mentioned in the staff report, but not the reason.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thanks, Councilman. So there was one dissenting vote and it was the same vote that dissented on the the rezoning three years ago on the southern part of the site. That person, that planning board member disagreed with the retention of the you oh two billboard use overlay and thought there wasn't a justifying circumstance to retain the allowance'",
        "'speaker_0': 'for future billboards.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That was it. Okay, that's not at all what I expected, but thank you, Graham. Can I ask you a question I think I've asked you before. You're probably wishing that RTD had bought you out by this point, right?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You wouldn't. You wouldn't do that. Right. And I think I brought this up before with your team. This was part of this site. The northern part of the site was part of the Argo smelter site. And I'm just wondering if there has been any analysis of the soil.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The heart of the Argo smelter is right where I-70 goes through. But there were buildings on the Denver Post site and there are buildings north of I-70 that were part of the smelter operation. I'm just wondering if there's been any analysis of what might have been left behind.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, we've done extensive analysis because you accounted for the brought this up since we bought the site. You know, we're fortunately not affected by the Argo smelter. Our biggest environmental issues were from the railroad track that used to run through the southern part of the site for the old Denver brick and pipe.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right. You know, arsenic containing railroad ties. So all those areas we've you know, we've come across through the various construction of fast tracks. We've come across, you know, unmarked underground storage tanks that we've remediated. So we have a little bit of everything on site, but nothing that requires stopping.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, clean up. Yep. So it's all fine for residential. And but we have had an extensive study, as you know, based upon your comments and and others.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I'm glad I could cost you the money. Did the Denver Post leave anything dirty behind?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Never mind. You know, as you know, ink is water soluble, so there is nothing dirty.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There you go. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. I've always said this to everybody. Don't entertain them. He'll keep going. Councilman Espinosa. Kyle got a question for you. And it might be like Councilman Flynn was a little bit surprised. We have three recent plans, all within the last six years that say urban, residential, urban, residential, urban residential, nearly 100%.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The only exception being open space. So help me out again with that, the sort of introduction of commercial and why that is consistent with adopted plans and why we haven't considered an OSA or SB sort of zoning in in is part of this entire package because to my counsel, my colleague, Councilwoman CNOOC's point is once this is'",
        "'speaker_0': 'free zone, they have entitlement. And and so we will have gone against not just the urban residential components of these plans, but also the open space component of these plans. Sure. So let me take this one at a time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So first, regarding the urban residents of land use designation, we took a close look at the language of the plans as well as the language in the neighborhood or in sorry, in the zone district intent statements for the various districts that the applicant applied for.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And in each of them, it indicated to us that while residential was the primary character of the area, they all called for as well some complimentary serving commercial uses that would serve those future residences and act as a transition between an entirely commercial or industrial area and an entirely residential area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so what when we took a look at those plans and the language behind what urban residential means, we found that those land uses and the mix of uses and the building forms that would be allowed in the districts that are proposed by the applicant, we found that it could be found consistent with those plan recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So that's where we were. And Planning Board concurred with that analysis. Regarding the open space zoning, when you take those one at a time. So first with the OSA zoning that can only be applied to lands owned or operated by Denver Park.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in the future, as this area develops and if parts of the park go to Denver parks, I think you will maybe see Denver Parks bring you an OSA application or something like that. But this is a private owned, so OSA isn't even an option for them.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You have a fair point, though, about what? About open space? Generally, what we find is that applicants who are at this stage of development don't zone to open space because they're, you know, still to the boundaries of what ultimately become the parcel lines will change a little bit over time as phases develop.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a large site will develop in phases. And so what we find is that typically folks are going to ask for zone districts that allow open space but don't only allow open space so that that open space can be provided for, but with the flexibility over time for the definition of those boundaries.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So in order to compel the open space you've heard about the infrastructure master plan and the development agreement will ensure that we get the open space that is new, that is will be enabled through the zoning in the rezoning bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I'm going to have to follow up with you to sort of better understand how we sort of articulate zone lots and things like that because they seem very specific in the developer agreement down to the hundreds of Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Down to the hundredths of a of an acre on what, how much open space will be provided. So it seems like they have a pretty developed idea about where that is and what that is that I almost wish we were capturing it, you know, other than through a private party agreement.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That is not part of this council's consideration, although it sort of weirdly is. But yeah, sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I do want to just note the development agreement to Kyle's point about OCA that it can't be applied until it's actually sitting on land. The development agreement does call for the largest parcel to be called right now anyway, Fox Park of 2.52 acres that once it's developed and through the warranty period and then transfer to the city'",
        "'speaker_8': ', we would designated as OSA at that point.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But again that's. Through private.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Party action. The. How big is this going to come? More questions. Yes, for more. These are all quick. How many square feet is the printing facility? The Denver Post. And since we're.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the existing funding facility is about.'",
        "'speaker_3': '227,000 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. The linkage fee is 25% more. The examples are residential. But I think Doug alluded to this. If if if it's commercially developed square footage, it will be subject to the commercial linkage fee. Is that correct? Okay. But it has to be new construction.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the 227,000 square feet of the printing facility would not be eligible for a linkage fee. Is that correct? It doesn't have to be new construction.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So per Jill Jennings calling again, per the linkage fee ordinance, it does not apply to existing buildings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm asking that because because Doug made it sound well. In his response. Does that mean that that that sort of square footage and the potential for that to be the commercial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which would be subject to the highest linkage fee sort of. You could surround that by urban residential and be consistent with the plans and really not get a 20 net 25% linkage fee for the totality of the site because that's a huge amount of money that is wrapped up in the considerable footage that would not be eligible'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And so I just one is, you know, without knowing what the total development potential is.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, I mean, yes, that's true. But it applies citywide today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Okay. And then Chris Nevitt. Where is the next step? Studies. Can you give me an update on that?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. The next step study. The scope was approved after going through the mill with various agencies. It's now on the street and so we expect to get proposals from consultant teams in a couple of weeks and then we'll be assessing who has the best proposal and moving forward.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what is council's involvement going to be with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Will be letting the contract.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Just the contract. But when they go out and start doing public outreach, are we having a dedicated.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah. Well, we'll be consulting with you guys with respect to all of the the public communication and participation from the community. But the the the contract, actually, it's a pretty small contract. It's $380,000, I think.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it may not come here, but. If you make us, we will.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Yeah, that's why I just wrote down. Asked for a briefing. Okay. Then the last question is. Yeah. You know, this is. This is a heavy lift for council, but it's an easy lift for a member of the administration.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'In your past life, you were a very strong labor advocate. One thing that I was always looking for is, you know, could we introduce project labor agreements? Did that ever? You know, when you're negotiating all these sorts of things in terms about about affordable housing, about transit.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Did you were you able to have that conversation about the delivery of these construction projects? Because that, too, is one way we could address affordability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Wow. You put me on the spot there, councilman. I'm that's that's not really in my current job description, so I haven't beaten that drum very hard. But I will say that constructing things is a job creator. And the I-70 project, the National Western Project, these are all projects that have a big apprenticeship and training component to them'",
        "'speaker_4': '. And my hope would be that that would bleed over into other big construction projects in this area as well. It's all part of the same neighborhood. Understand that we're not at a construction project yet. We have to do the next step study to figure out what we're going to build.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we have to figure out how to raise the money to pay for it. And then we're going to get to construction. But I think there's plenty of room for conversations between now and then.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Don't stick your neck out too far. But but you're on that side. We're on this side. You still have advocates and support on this side of this. Yes. So by all means, feel free to approach that. Thanks. Okay, Councilman, I take you back up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Do you want Councilman Cashman to go first?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'He said he was right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'His question is answered. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked to two quick questions. The first is. And I'm looking at you, Mr. Harrigan. If. Tax increment finance is requested. Typically, that gives us a second bite at the apple, if you will, to look at extracting more affordability in the housing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can you speak to whether or not the housing plan set some guidance for because those get negotiated by Durham, not necessarily by OSD, unless they check in and weigh in with you on that, which I'm not sure what that practice is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But did the housing plan set some guidelines for Durham on how that gets done so that we have a floor to work from, if you will?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, that's a very good question. So we do engage with Dora, with Tracey Huggins and have regular meetings.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If there is tax increment, finance.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And public dollars are being utilized. It is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Different discussion.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's individually negotiated and we are going through that right now. And some discussions in this case as we had discussed this potentially being tiff and then not being TIFF and had other discussions. As I understand, we have an opportunity to reopen discussions and address this topic again.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's a really good question because as we evaluated this and there's a lot of discussion over one times the linkage fee, which are developments and the city is required to pay versus 1.25 you have here today. And then as we look at the 30th and Blake overlay district and the four times fee, we see that as'",
        "'speaker_4': 'having public subsidy in the form of that density bonus.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So you have different.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Different types of negotiating depending on the circumstance in the case so that the tax increment finance, should it be one times linkage, three or four times the linkage fee? I think that's a negotiation and discussion in this case with the Metro District being on the table here and not taking city taxpayer dollars.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, I think this is a very fair deal to get 25% above and beyond. We really, as Department Office of Economic Development, we really want to provide a sense of market stability. And right now, there is not a policy to say for metro districts it should be 2x3x4x.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think that's something our department needs to really look into going forward, especially as we reopen or reassess the linkage fee next year.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I'll save the other part for my comments. But my next question. Did Chris know through your. Chris, I just wanted to to sort of push a little further on the next step study because I keep hearing that it's focus is on transportation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I want to know how drainage plays into the next step study because we know that the the global storm drainage study is underway. How much does that shape what falls into the next step study in addressing both drainage?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because if we only address transportation and we don't do anything with drainage and we have flooding, 38th Avenue is going to create further gridlock at that intersection of 38th box I-25. And. What's the other one?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Park.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Park Avenue. Park Avenue. So we won't be doing any justice to the collective work we're trying to do if we don't truly address that intersection problem and the drainage there. So just help me understand, is it just transportation or is it transportation?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And drainage is part of what that next step study is addressing. And then the next piece of that is how do we anticipate that all of the property owners in this area, not just this particular site, because we've got a number of that have been rezone, but they haven't built yet and we've got some high densities that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'have been approved in this area. So how will they all then contribute towards addressing the infrastructure challenges that we have in this area?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got it. Yeah, that's a great question. So the next step study is primarily focused on transportation, but I think this is a good example of all the pieces and parts in the city working closely together and working in harmony.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the Globeville stormwater study that's been sort of up and moving forward for about a year, and the group that's working on the next step study for this project met with the project manager and principals in that project and tried to figure out exactly because we didn't want to waste money by doing redundant work.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I agree with that. We wanted our work to be complementary and so we've worked very closely with them. What's the work that they're doing? How can the their drainage work inform the transportation infrastructure that we will be focusing on?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also, how will the transportation infrastructure that we're working on inform their drainage work? And I'll give you in fact, the 38th Avenue Canal is a great example. If one of the big moves is the reconstruction of that 38th Park Fox 25 interchange and how it interacts with the 38th Avenue underpass.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'If the drainage study is talking about moving or building new drainage infrastructure there, the transportation project would be the perfect opportunity to execute on that. So that's how we're going to be working closely together so that they they complement each other.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Your question about the funding is, is right on the money, if you'll excuse the pun, and we don't have the answer to that yet. And this next step study is going to be very different than a next step study, the next step studies that we've done in the past in that it will focus explicitly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the scope elements is to focus explicitly on all the different ways in which money can be raised to meet the the the need that's identified in the study. Usually the study identifies the projects and comes up with a concept price and then kind of leaves it at that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This study will also begin to answer the question How can that be paid for? Who pays and how much?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So in that, is there an expectation that the developers in this area will contribute towards that so that it's not expected that we just build it to max capacity? Yes, ma'am. And the taxpayers end up dealing with trying to solve the problem.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes, indeed. So in the development agreement, that is the companion to this rezoning and that also gives legal teeth to the infrastructure master plan in the development agreement is a limited to a couple of things. There's a limit to the amount of development that this project that these developers or the vertical developers that that that follow.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There's a limit to the amount that they can develop based on the capacity for traffic in the neighborhood. So they cannot you know, you refer to while there's this entitlement and they could build to their full entitlement and that's going to blow up the infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We won't let that happen. They can't build beyond that capacity, number one. And number two. The development agreement actually anticipates it. We don't have the answer yet, so we couldn't really memorialize it. But the development agreement anticipates a more comprehensive mobility solution to which this property owner and other property owners in the neighborhood will contribute.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that just raises one quick question for the city attorney, and I just want to make sure that by. Approving the rezone with the density allowable on the site, that we're not putting the city in a situation where we're going to be in a legal entanglement because there's a perception that they could build to the approved height'",
        "'speaker_5': 'limits, but yet we're putting this cap on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I get the question you're asking. And Brad Beck's coming up here. You're asking if we say here's your entitlement and then they try to execute on that and we say, no, no, wait a minute, how do we deal with that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah, and I understand you've put some language in in the agreement, but there's some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Brad Becker, the city attorney's office. There's a chip count mechanism built into the development agreement so that we can meter that out. And the city always has its health and safety hammer if it needed to if it needed to exercise it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Who counts on us. When I was you, you became a city attorney. Needs to stick around. I just wanted to know what established the capacity of the neighborhood. That's. That's a new one. You know, I get why you're saying that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But what sort of documented or scientific evidence do we have that there is a capacity to a neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'From an infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Infrastructure perspective.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'However, your.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Staff might have to. It's probably a better answer by. Chris, now that or perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because we're talking.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'The traffic studies that have been.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Because we're talking trip count. Are you just talking peak hour because you've got a 24 seven day and you're essentially saying that only transit would only occur? Or are you saying that that this new capacity of a neighborhood is an F intersection on both routes?'",
        "'speaker_0': '24 seven. You know, what is this?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So we worked Jill Jennings school like we worked very closely with our friends in public works and unfortunately Eric Osmonds and couldn't join us tonight. And looking at traffic studies done in this area, traffic studies prepared by the developer in this case, we were able and recent traffic counts to come up with a number related to how'",
        "'speaker_8': 'many trips are already out in this area. And then based on current roadway and intersection design today, how many trips that can handle before essentially there is failure and no one can move safely through the intersection. So that's how we came up with the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Number at peak hour or how many hours during actually actually, don't worry about it. If you could just get me that and have a look. I want to have a better understanding because there are other neighborhoods that basically feel like they're at capacity and we can't get that sort of scrutiny.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what we've learned is that the threshold for pain is very, very high. And in part of me thinks that if we develop this, if we plan this area and developed it in a way that was more holistic, where the services and everything were there, you could actually reduce trip counts and and and actually hitting capacity might'",
        "'speaker_0': 'actually spur that sort of growth within the boundaries rather than encouraging migration out.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So, so there are a couple of things with this development in particular as the development agreement requires that with a site development plan, they submit a transportation demand management plan to look at sort of how are they dealing with trips and reducing trips overall?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Because we know that is an issue here. That is something I think we're starting to have conversations about citywide. I think we've done it and a couple other developments through development agreement in the past. And then to just add on to what Chris was talking about, the framework in this development agreement, we are working and have already'",
        "'speaker_8': 'started drafting rules and regulations that would apply to this entire area, 184 acres, if memory serves, to set this trip capacity in place for all development coming forward. So we are going to be piggybacking on the parking maximum conversation that we have started with in community planning and development for this area.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, aimed at how do we reduce trips and ensure that there is enough capacity for existing and new redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Have you considered to to my colleague's question related to that about this developer versus prior rezonings that we've already approved, have you considered that the potential for the TDM component in some of these transit components being an overlay so that it's not just applicable to this and everybody going forward, but that we could sort of retroactively apply'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So the rules and regulations will require any time someone within this development comes in with a site development plan, they would have to provide a transportation demand management plan, assuming the rules are adopted. But that's what we are diligently working to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So whether it's been zoned or not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Oh, great. Thank you. All right. That closes the you make sure questions and also the people here before 12 are going into comments by members of council. Representing this district. I'll I'll go first. Couple of things that I'll start off with, number one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think every rezoning in this area for the last. Three years. There's been one to maybe three people talking about a mobility and transportation plan for the zone. And this is the first rezoning where there's a plan and there's actually a dollar amount that is committed to it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I just want to say, you know, we've been talking about this for a long time. You know, those of us who know this area, I just walked this area on Friday. I don't I don't think people understand the existing condition of this area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And if you haven't been there, you need to go. And so I appreciate the investment now that we've tied a dollar amount. And I appreciate my former colleague from president of City Council, Chris Nevitt, working so hard on this along with all the CPD and all the folks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for that. Speaking to the existing condition, we talk a lot about, you know, do it, do it yourself. Artists, nonprofits. Do you know where those people exist right now? They exist in this area, and not a lot of people know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I want to thank you all from a for for helping folks at Taco Fest. There's going to be thousands of people there this weekend and there are a lot of artists I went and visited last week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I know a lot of people think this area is going to get developed very quickly and it's going to be a while. And I hope that we don't displace those folks who are currently in all of these buildings that are in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So so that as far as the zoning goes, I mean, as I look at their criteria, as I look at the consistency with the adopted plans that just got approved in 2014, uniform uniformity with district regulations will hold on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Number three to further the public health and safety and welfare, justifying circumstances, consistency with neighborhood context that the rezoning actually applies. And the public health and safety to me goes directly with the community benefit agreements. I should say the development agreement agreements that benefit the community and you know, totally on board what's going on with the transportation'",
        "'speaker_0': 'mobility plan. Loved the maximums parking maximums when you be doing that all over the city, especially near transit. You know, I feel like on the, you know, councilwoman and each and I have talked about this a lot and I feel like her questions were right on point at the beginning of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we've kind of debated this issue. I know. Which what didn't get shared during the comment the question period. I know that the developer came with a plot of land to dedicate as affordable housing. That plot of land was on the north.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'West, northeast side of the property. That particular location to OED and others didn't feel like that was the best location. And so they negotiated a one point, whatever you guys call it. We'll just say two bucks a square foot, 11.2 times the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, the question here is, should OED have negotiated a better deal for the land? Because I agree with councilman Councilwoman Kenney. We do need to get land. But when? How long are we willing to wait to that land gets developed for affordable housing?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Or do we take the cash and begin immediately to put it into a fund and begin getting getting affordable units now? So that is kind of the consideration around the affordable housing that I have been wrestling. Two things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'One, if we could if we have the authority to negotiate, we probably would have pushed a development to see if we could get more of that Southern property, knowing that we would get that development much faster, knowing that you could get utilities there much faster.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I feel like that northern property you will not get utilities to and you will not see those unit realized as fast as you as we could see them to. If we do get the cash, can OED direct those dollars to the first developer who steps there and buy down affordable units, much like we've done on Welton?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so those are some considerations that we need to begin to look at. I am, you know, mostly appreciative of the efforts going on. I feel like we could have done a little bit harder job on the development agreement regarding affordable housing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to support this. I'm going to be watching this. I'm going to be working with with Eric Harada and working with OED to make sure that those dollars get invested right back into the site. I do agree with my council members that in the plan, all it talked about was affordable housing around this station, and we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'have to make sure that we build those units. But the negotiation wasn't as easy, I think, as sometimes we talk about. Right. There's a lot of there is a lot of difficulty in this. And so this is part of the tough constraints of being the council, the legislative body, trying to step into the executive body that makes'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the agreements. And so I'm going to support this, and I'm excited to hear what my colleagues have to say. Councilman Espinosa. So this one, this one's frustrating for me. You know, traditionally, I you know, I spoke out on a few of these exile in Arizona, and they spoke out about the need for infrastructure and some of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'things we were overlooking. And and then at some point, I just was like, well, I guess we'll will meet this problem when it finally manifests itself and and continued to support subsequent rezonings without speaking up. And then this comes through and it's like, oh, we expect this developer to sort of now start to finally address all of'",
        "'speaker_0': 'the concerns that some of us have been articulating from day one on Fox Island. And I get frustrated by this because to me this is not enough density. And I've said that privately and now I'm saying it publicly because the developer has made that move and made that proposal to retain the Denver Post building on an area'",
        "'speaker_0': 'that was mapped 12 storey. It's a huge cut in the amount of developable development potential there. And rather than sort of squeeze it back onto the available development footprint to increase density and help support this station area, we just said, nope, you're capped for some arbitrary thing that we're creating when all of those plans were developed around'",
        "'speaker_0': 'those existing roadways with a planned connection to alleviate this concern. And so rather than do all the infrastructure things that we need to do, which I've been articulating since day one on this council and asked for for funding in the Geo Bond to ask, we have said no, we're going to depress the scale here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Which when we do that, we depress the potential to do land value capture and work with developers to deliver affordable housing. And instead we're paying for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A. Trickle of the of the need and. And so. I continue to watch this area. Flounder through some sort of vision without a real vision. It will be successful eventually, but I wish next steps had occurred when I got elected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When this council was articulating this concern and that we had land value capture in a meaningful way. You know, and what I mean by meaningful way is the thing that I have been throwing down constantly for about two months now.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I want you to hear this, Erica Raga, because you're the one person that I need to talk to that I haven't walked through this area with this proposal. But I think there is a way to do revenue neutral development to the city and largely to the developer and deliver units with each project that gets constructed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Through this land value captured and incent this so that we're not just because we are not going to subsidize our way out of this problem, we have to construct. And provide I mean, have these housing units available. And I know it can be successful in a mixed income environment and it will be healthy to develop around our'",
        "'speaker_0': 'transit stations. And so if we thought about this and we did this, and I would I will sit down with you and other developers in this room. Tim Santos, you're a very savvy, housing savvy individual as well. Let's talk about this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the question of where. I mean, will there be housing and where will affordable housing be in projects? Will should never come up anymore. We know in our Todd areas we will get them as a product, a byproduct of any development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the only reason you wouldn't get it is because nobody's building. But as soon as somebody is building residential, there's going to be an affordable component. And yeah, we can't mandate it, but we can incentivize and we can do it in a way that is far more productive than anything we have approached thus far, because a four'",
        "'speaker_0': 'exit at 38th and Blake is really a2x, it's just doubling the linkage fee when you do all the math and massing of those projects. And here. 1.25. It's just it's a drop. It's a it's the word pathetic is going to come out of my mouth.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the response from a developer when they say we want to do more is should never be. You can pay more. Money is great because I say homes are better. I've already said it. We will not subsidize our way out of this.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We must build inclusively and we can do it so that it is revenue neutral for the city. And will benefit the developer at the same time. So regardless, I will follow the the this is not the reason I have laid out a much bigger problem.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It is not the function of this particular reasoning to capture and resolve these issues. These are city issues. These are matters for council and the administration to do a better job in addressing. And I'm just saying that what this is does not do a better job at addressing, but it is consistent and better than anything we have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'put forward on Fox Island to date. So with that, I will continue to to support these rezonings. But I ask, there are still tons of opportunity. I mentioned this last week on the Evans rezoning and another Todd area where we have massive industrial land and we have several others like that that are opportunities waiting to happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we have to lay down new provisions, new regulations to address these concerns in real time things. All right, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank Councilman Espinosa for those remarks. I agree with him and I adopt them. And I'm going to support this rezoning because I believe it meets all of the criterion criteria that are required.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And not only that, I think that this is a project that that is necessary up there. That's why we're building transit. I think we dodged a big bullet, Grandma, when RTD wanted to build a commuter rail maintenance facility there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Imagine if a massive part of this station area had been taken up with a rail yard and a maintenance facility that RTD ended up building on the north side of the highway instead. In fact, I remember Carl Marcello, the late Carl Marcella, when he told us that Mayor Hickenlooper called him into the office.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Graham I don't know if you were there, but Mike Shanahan was in the room and Mayor Hickenlooper said that Carl Marcello, who was the head of RTD, you will not build your maintenance facility on this on this property.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that's a very fortunate thing that happened, because this is exactly where we want to build. We want to build this diversity of housing, this density of housing with its access to the regional rail network. And so I'm very happy to support and I think it's a legacy of Denver's old industrial areas, we reasoned, one'",
        "'speaker_6': 'last week as well. And we keep taking areas that used to be rail yard. We're talking about now the old rice yards last week where we where we approved the new downtown area plan amendment that will possibly convert that area into an urban neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And now we're looking again at the old Argo smelter and even the one we just approved earlier over in Park Hill and Harley Street is right next to the site of the original Lowry Field. And it just shows how the city continues to evolve and it continues to change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And these are necessary changes to accommodate a growing population with a diversity of housing options. So I'm very happy to support this, Mr. President. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Cannick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. For almost 15 years now, I have been engaged in most of the conversations around big redevelopments in this city and have studied closely the ones that preceded my time. And I have been a defender of area planning, even though it takes an enormous amount of community resources and times.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And Elizabeth knows this. It's a lot of meetings, it's a lot of input. And residents are always skeptical and they say, can we trust what you put in this plan? Can we believe you when you say the things in this plan?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I have defended the value of those plans because I have believed they set a guideline that I believe in most cases we strive to achieve. But today I can't say that that's true. So I have two things that we need to lay out for the record here.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The one is, does the zoning conform to the plans of the city? The language of those plans. And then the second question, because I think it's important. Would it have been possible would it have been fair to have this project conform to those plans?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think you've got to answer both those questions. So let me just lay down some record. Transit oriented development strategic plan of 2014 include a range of housing types and affordability, with mixed use development at or near stations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Housing an inclusive Denver Action Plan. Prioritize the building of creative creation of affordable housing in vulnerable areas, including areas vulnerable to displacement and neighborhoods that have strong amenities such as transit. OED housing investment priorities already prioritizes development of affordable housing that includes services or is located near fixed rail transit and high frequency bus lines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Globeville neighborhood plan. It means having access to a vibrant system, including quality jobs, affordable and diverse housing options. Global development plan also states, and it specifically calls out that this site should be considered for use for a community land trust because there is a risk that the recommended development intensity creates exceeding existing conditions on the ground that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'could result in displacement. 41st and Fox Plan. I mentioned already 12 or 13 mentions, including a requirement to develop an affordable housing strategy from CPD and OED. Working together for this station area, including mixed income housing, requires this area to follow the recommendations in the TOD plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just for the lawyers in the room, the tiered strategic plan is probably not an adopted plan except the 41st and FOX Plan is adopted and it says that we are going to follow the recommendations of the two D strategic plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It mentioned specifically on page 36. And I just want to read this because this is what we're talking about. While the home prices remain affordable to existing residents, the presence of the station may increase property values and overall desirability of the area.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This will create a new develop. This will require a new need for new development to provide housing types for diverse income levels. We got it right as a city in these plans, we said we know that there's going to be an impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We know we need to have a plan for it. And we need to build diverse, mixed income housing on this site. Not a single mention of paying for it to build somewhere else. So we clearly do not have a zoning paired with this agreement that conform to the language of our adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the question is, could we have done it? Could we have come up with the zoning and or associated agreements that conformed? Well, first of all, I just want to be really clear. My exchange was with the Office of Economic Development.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I helped write the bill for the linkage fee with my colleague in the administration. We clearly left a path for affordable housing negotiated plans in the ordinance. Why did we do that? The linkage fee was never designed to be an affordable housing planning tool.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I agree with one of the speakers tonight. It was a floor where there's nothing else. This applies. Linkage fees are designed for buildings. There's nothing in that ordinance that states that it's intended to be a planning tool or that it's intended to determine what neighborhoods need for housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That's just not what it was designed for. And we made sure there was a path so that where we had large, important redevelopments, we could continue to to make sure we had all the robust planning processes necessary. So has anyone else done it before?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has anyone else? In a big, complicated, multi-phased area committed to building affordable housing on site? Well, they have. And they haven't just done it in tive projects. The Central Valley did not get to if it was a metropolitan district and they committed to on site housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And guess what? They had environmental contamination. They had railroads to deal with. They had many barriers, lack of infrastructure. They had no street grid. Now, they may not have been quite as isolated, but I don't think anyone can say that it was not a tough site and they committed ahead of time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As master developers to pass on the obligation to their verticals. And they figured it out. And by the way, we did not subsidize it. They built it without subsidy. So I want that record to be clear. Others have done it and they've done it in many different ways, which is important when we think about the question came'",
        "'speaker_3': 'up. Well, there's no policy. Well, there's no policy in part because every site's different. And I think that that has worked, right. So at ninth in Colorado, they built slightly off site one just on the other side of the street because it worked.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And they actually built it early. They built it before the rest of the housing St Anthony's. They dedicated some land to DHS. They built some mixed use on site. Gates, had a totally different approach where they're going to sprinkle the units throughout every one of these projects got the benefit of thinking creatively and solving for housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They committed ahead of time in some cases without knowing where it would go, in other cases, dedicating it. So the absence of a policy created a lot of flexibility for developers, and it created a lot of flexibility for the city to be creative.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sometimes we bring additional subsidies, sometimes we don't. But make no mistake, large, complicated redevelopment sites can absolutely commit to affordable housing and they can deliver it, and they have done it in the city's history. So should it be done?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I think that answer I mean, we don't even need to debate that. We have a dire need and land is very scarce and it's needed. And this neighborhood at every turn has said to us, Where are you on preventing displacement?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we talked about this last time. Displacement isn't just when you're removing the houses on your site, it's the ripple effects that are going to happen from property values and change outside your site. So even though not a single housing unit is going to be lost on this site, it's going to have the potential to displace and'",
        "'speaker_3': 'our plans recognize that. So we have a situation where it was hard. The first land offered wasn't the right land. And I respect the decision that that wasn't the right approach. But we had every plan obligation to stay at the table, to figure it out, to be more creative and use the institutional history of this city.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There are really well-intentioned folks here, but we don't have affordable housing planning as a as a as a as a job description. And we didn't use, I don't think, any of the history of these plans and the institute.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have newer staff, maybe some folks weren't around when we did Central Park Valley, I'm not sure, but we missed the opportunity. And so because it was in the plans and because it was possible and it is not in this final thing, this does not meet the criteria for any of adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the question I just want to close with is what do we do from here? Right. I can't vote for this. I won't vote for this because of of it failing to meet these legal requirements and failing to meet my moral requirements for meeting all of these things that we've helped to create, all these expectations we've created'",
        "'speaker_3': 'for our community. So what do we do going forward? Well, one, we need to break down the silos. We can't have one department doing big planning and visioning and then do it without. And community dialog. I didn't even quote all the places where the community meetings from Globeville residents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I got a call today from a global resident asking about this. So so we can't have one department that's not at the public meetings negotiating the affordable housing plan separate from the department that wrote the plans. That can't happen.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Anymore.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We need to give the department the staff capacity and expertize. You need. Administering an ordinance and approving a funding agreement for affordable housing is very different than planning a 50 acre site. It's a different skill set. We need to give you the talent and the capacity you need to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And frankly, we as a council need to have a conversation now about policy, because I've had a lot of trust for a lot of years that these things would get figured out, that people would come check back with us as council.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We had a conversation about this. I pulled the record as early as 2016 about this site. I think my first meeting with the developer was in Philly. So every piece of indication was there and all the systems failed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it's time. Let's talk about policy. Let's talk about written policy. So we I going to bring this to the housing and homelessness workgroup. And, you know, maybe it's time to end the flexibility. It's time to say, here's what happens when you want a big catalytic site with a lot of these considerations.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Let's create rules and there's no more no more negotiating. Or let's put the council as the approving party of affordable housing approaches so that there's no more disconnect where no one comes and talks to us about what's being negotiated until they have a signed agreement.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. So there's a lot of paths. Let's do some research. Let's see how other cities are doing this. But the trust the trust method, it didn't it failed us. And 2800 housing units might be built without any affordability.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2800. I can't live with that. And if that's a risk of ever happening again, we need a new approach. So I'd love to hear council feedback after this meeting about whether you're interested in that conversation, the Housing and Homelessness Workgroup.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I thank you for your time today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Cannick Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, we should be close to each other. I can understand the confusion. I'm tempted to say what she said.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We can we can assume.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Based on intent and promises. I don't know how long Mr. Bennis is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Involved with that property.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It reminds me of when I first heard about rezoning for liquor licenses that you need to be careful when you create a new license for this great guy who stands before you. Because the next guy, unless he's an out and out felon.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'May not have the same intent for your community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I agree with the councilwoman. I interpret the are plans to give emphasis to the creation of affordable housing, but for me even more strongly is the third criteria that talks about concern excuse me, concern for the public health and welfare, my office and hears on a daily basis.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The two greatest concerns in the city are about traffic and about affordable housing. Now, I do believe we may be on an infrastructure path with this parcel that that takes a serious look at how to control trips. But for affordable housing, it's just another.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Buyout.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Opportunity. I mean, we zoned. I was the lone.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'No vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'On zoning, I believe 100 acres of Arapahoe Square because there was no affordable.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Housing component. And here again.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're looking at something that approaches half of that size and again, with tremendous connectivity to to rail and mass transit options and again.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'With no.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Affordable housing component and are. It is my personal belief that our linkage fee anyway is embarrassingly low. But there's only so much you can do with cash when we keep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Giving our land away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You know, we we are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Landlocked.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the number of units that we need to create, we can't keep giving these large parcels away. Again, based on intent and promises, it needs to be. It just needs to be a deeper part of our ethos. I mean, we spent so long.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'On.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our recent housing plan that talks over and over about the crisis we're in and the import of of of affordable housing. So. Yeah. I'm, um. I think we've got a great developer, but I'm going to have to vote against this plan tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So let me first start by saying I live in this area. I drive this route routinely and the infrastructure is not sufficient even for today's traffic, with all the new development that has already occurred in Sunnyside, in Highlands.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, you've got a tremendous amount of traffic that comes off of Park Avenue trying to get into North Denver. And then, you know, as you add the development to this area. We're going to be challenged on how to get people in and out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And yes, some will take the train, but a lot of people will still drive their cars because not everybody is going straight downtown. Our train system doesn't get everybody where you're trying to go and our bus connections don't link to our train to get everybody to that first and last mile.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So addressing the infrastructure issues, both transportation and drainage in this area are critical to anything that's going to happen there, because if we don't do that, guess what? We're already gridlocked at that intersection. So we have to address that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, is affordable housing important? Absolutely. I've been a huge advocate of affordable housing. Been on the board of a nonprofit housing group for over 30 years. It's a priority for us to address in this city. But. I just have to go back to the work we did on our housing plan.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We gave up our inclusionary housing ordinance. If these guys proposed to build any for sale housing, they would have to include 10% of their units. But we gave that up. I argued we shouldn't do that because that was one more tool in our toolbox that gave us at least something to have our housing developers contribute towards our'",
        "'speaker_5': 'affordability of housing. Yeah, it's up for sale, but and we think we've overcome that with the changes that we brought forward a couple of years ago to address the construction defect issue. So we're starting to see, you know, some developers build for sale housing in the city, but we gave that up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I don't think we should have. Does that mean we shouldn't be seeing affordability on the rental side here? No, that's not what I'm saying. I mean, we'd love to see that. But I think, you know, a couple of things here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'As we continue to rezone large parcels. When it comes time to try to get affordability on there, the the person rezoning it can now sell it for higher and better use. So that challenges us being able to get affordability in those developments.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I get, you know, trying to masterplan the site and address the infrastructure needs for the site. But we need to change our policy so that we as much as we have the legal authority and we were able to do this with construction defects, even though we were told the state legislature has control.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We adopted our own legislation here on how to do that. So we should be able to figure out how we do that on the affordability side for rental and for sale housing in this city. And I'm committed to working with the housing group Housing and Homeless Group to figure out what are the policy changes that we need'",
        "'speaker_5': 'to make so that we have the tool, we have the hook to include affordability in all of our development. We should not be letting people buy out where we want to see units constructed. We keep letting that happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And guess what? We're not getting the units. We're getting the money. And then we're saying, Oh, you can go build over there or you can go build over there. But in the areas where we want to see a mix of income levels, guess what?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not happening. We need to figure out how to make that happen. But we got to do that with our policy changes because to say, you know, you followed the rules, but we want you to do this, it's not fair.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We need to change the policy that gives us the right to extract what we need and want to see happen. In all the developments in this city and especially the large developments where we're seeing, boom, massive development coming in to our city and what does that do?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's going to have that continued push out effect to the adjacent neighborhoods because people like coming into the area because there's just fun stuff to do in these areas. But guess what? Now they're going to look at Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're going to look at houses in in the adjacent neighborhoods that haven't already been turned over. And we have tried to look at including density at our TOD sites where that's where we want that. That's where we want the height.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We want all of that at. Todd. And not have that then, you know, take over our adjacent residential neighborhoods. You know, Jefferson Park is an example where boom, nothing, nothing even looks the same in that neighborhood. It's been completely redeveloped for the most part.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So, you know, I. I appreciate the work that the city has done and that this developer has done in addressing the infrastructure issues, which, again, to see anything new and different happen in this area which has already been designated as a TOD area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The neighborhood wants to see the development there and not in the neighborhood. So I'm inclined to support this tonight, even though it doesn't have the strong commitment to affordable housing. And my hope is that this applicant sees and hears this message loud and clear and figures out a way to ensure that affordability is front and center in'",
        "'speaker_5': 'everything that is done helps. Ensure that those units are on the site and not just contribute the funding to it and see those units go elsewhere, because I think that's a critical part. I don't believe we're going to see 2800 units built on the site as long as the commitment is to keep that building on the site'",
        "'speaker_5': ', which I think is an incredible building. And we've talked about, you know, a potential use for that site that I think would make that whole location even far more attractive than what you guys are looking at or thinking about at this point in time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But. I just think that. The fact that we have the development agreement that links back to the project and ensures that we're also looking at the trip count. And you know, that is also a cap, if you will, on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it ensures that we do this next step, study and address all of that upfront as part of of all of this. Otherwise, then not just this developer, but the others who will then come in through their development agreements will be required to, you know, to try to ensure that they're there addressing that cap as well.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think those safeguards are in place. I'm anxious to see the outcome of the next step study and would just respectfully ask that that be brought to the appropriate committee so that we can be updated on where that's at in the process.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, once the contractor selected and they move through the process to at least give us an update of where that's moving. The last thing I'll say, and this is too, a comment made by SACU, is that. This whole process changed when the 2010 zoning was adopted.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'City Council used to see a lot more detail in terms of number of units, number of parking spaces, traffic studies. You know, it's a whole different way that this body looks at the applications from the body that I served with.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so, again, if we want to see some changes, we need to look at the policy changes that we have to make. And we are the legislative branch that can do that so that we address those upfront and be able to look at the things that we want to see happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And obviously, we don't do that in a vacuum, just like when we created the original IATO. It was done in collaboration with the development partners in this city. So with that, I will be supporting this tonight and am committed to working with Councilwoman Kim Inches Committee to change our policy so that we have a way to ensure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that with these large developments, we're getting affordability in these projects. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. This concludes the comment portion of city council. It's been moved in second. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Black Eye Clark by Espinosa Flynn I. Gilmore, i. Herndon High Fashion. No carnage. Lopez No new, huh? Ortega Mr. President.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'First criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are three plans that apply to this property. First is comprehensive plan 2000. As described in the staff report, staff has found that the proposed rezoning is consistent with these five strategies from campaign 2000 relating to infill development, mixed use development, providing services and neighborhoods, and being consistent with the the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'character of existing neighborhoods of which the proposed use next to would do. The second plan is Blueprint Denver from 2000 to the concept plan used for this property is single family duplex, which calls for primarily residential but with complementary small scale commercial uses, such as those that would be allowed under the proposed U.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Next two zoning. There is also an area of stability which calls for maintaining the character of an area while accommodating some new development. As I mentioned, Baker has this pattern of small commercial buildings on corners, and this property is a nonresidential property already.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So this would be maintaining the existing character of the area. Both a lot of Street and Fourth Avenue are designated locals consistent with the proposed you elected to zoning. The third plan is the Baker Neighborhood Plan from 23.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In general, the Baker plan calls for providing a mixture of uses and providing services for the residents in the area. This property is in the single family and row house sub area, which calls for re-using vacant or underutilized commercial buildings which the proposed rezoning would allow and for removing non-conforming industrial uses.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I mentioned, this used to be a fortune cookie factory and industrial use. The rezoning to use mix two would remove the possibility of that going back as an industrial use and instead allow compatible commercial and residential development.'",

Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of the mixed two zone district.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare of the city. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's adopted plans and facilitating the re-use of an existing building in a currently vacant parcel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning is justified by the changed conditions, and there's been additional development and redevelopment in the Becker neighborhood. The population has increased. The demand for these kind of neighborhood services has increased.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so it's appropriate to rezone to allow for neighborhood serving commercial uses and residential on the property. And the fifth criterion is consistency with neighborhood context, zoned district purpose and intent. As mentioned, the existing context is urban neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The proposed context is also urban neighborhood. This is a good example of an urban neighborhood context in daycare. So it's consistent with that. And the Annex two would allow development consistent with the purpose of the intent of that zone district so that staff finds all five criteria and recommends approval.'",

So currently for informational notice, within ten days of a determination of a complete application, the city notifies the following parties the city council members in whose district the subject property is located, the At-Large City Council members and R.A., whose boundaries encompass are located within 200 feet'",

Moreover, the proposed text amendment is an improvement to encourage citizen involvement during the early stages of the rezoning process, regardless of which zone district your property is located.'",
