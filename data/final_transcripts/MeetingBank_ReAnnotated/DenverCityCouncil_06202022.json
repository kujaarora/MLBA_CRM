So, Bill, five, seven, seven is a bill for an ordinance exempting diapers, including incontinence products from sales tax in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So just wanted to call this out because I have to put my glasses on because I can't see anything, because it went through committee on consent and we haven't really had an opportunity to kind of bring it up and talk about it yet.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I wanted to just kind of call attention to it. The state legislature passed a sales tax exemption on diapers and menstrual products this session, which is wonderful. It's up to each city, though, to decide whether to exempt these items from local sales tax as well or not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Denver already exempts medicinal products thanks to Councilman Clark's 2019 legislation. So this ordinance just adds diapers, like I mentioned, including adult incontinence products to the list of necessary items that are exempted from sales tax in Denver. And just wanted to point out, this ordinance is in alignment with our values as a council, and it has the effect'",

It's much needed given the unprecedented inflationary pressures that we're seeing right now. And the Budget Management Office estimates that it's got a fiscal note somewhere between 500,000 and $800,000 annually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it isn't a huge amount of money. But I really hope that Denver's families and older adults who are using these products, of course, no one uses these products. But if there was someone using these products in our older adult category that, you know, we hope that this helps them keep some of that hard earned money in'",

        "'speaker_6': 'is providing. I don't think that this is a good idea to institute a sunset were this to sunset without council action. You know, the the program would immediately terminate without necessarily a plan on how to continue to provide trash service, how that would be funded that could lead, you know, in an in a budget that we have'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And so I just don't think that this is the appropriate way to to institute or the appropriate place for a sunset to be instituted, as we're talking about fees for a service that the city is providing and just the ramifications that, you know, and a sunset would have on the rest of the budget.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, I guess there's a possibility at that point that the general fund doesn't have the capacity to pay for this service.

        "'speaker_6': 'It would need to be a discussion like this about how should we handle this city service? And and I think that a sunset is absolutely the wrong mechanism for that.

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. I'll support the amendment. I believe in sunsetting new programs that have been not yet tried or proven. If it turns out in five years that all we have done is charge people a fee and not achieve the goal, then all we've done is displaced.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And I recall sitting here maybe five years ago when another member who shall remain nameless said to me, Why don't you support paying for trash? Just think what you could use that other $33 million once we free it up.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. So what we're doing is creating a forever fee on trash service. This is a service that our citizens in Denver have been able to enjoy all this time. And now, because we want to require everybody to compost, we've found a creative way of charging them based on the sized trash can they're going to use for'",

        "'speaker_2': 'The city is trying to fold this into where the city delivers all of this service, but they're going to charge everybody now, everybody meaning single family households and up to eight units. It doesn't include apartments. It doesn't include any of our business industry like McDonald's and Chick-Fil-A and many of those places that generate a lot of trash'",
        "'speaker_2': '. That is not always compostable products that they're using. And so I think the timing of bringing this forward is not appropriate. Creating a forever fee. If you all remember, taxpayers had to pay for the plant to Park Hill Drainage Project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That was based on how much you pay on your property for your impervious surface. But somehow we figured out a creative way to expound on charging you all for a 300 million plus dollar drainage project through raising your impervious surface piece.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is a fee that can be increased at any time based on a study that has to justify the increase to cover the cost. But instead of saying, let's just pay for composting, we're now somehow folding it in where everybody's going to pay for all of those services.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm bringing this sunset forward. We did this when we created the lower downtown historic district. We reviewed the existence of that district every two years for six years, and it was going to sunset at the end of six years.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So this is not something new that the city has done. And, you know, we're spending a lot of money and a lot of time to put together a program. That currently there are challenges with the billing system. You will hear at the public hearing, because I've received many, many emails about this, the inconsistency of our delivery of'",
        "'speaker_2': 'services. I think we're imposing a lot on our drivers in areas where we have moved the trash service from the alley to the street. We're now seeing in those cases where we have citizens who cannot get their three bins down a stairwell, a staircase, if you will, down their steps to the front of their street.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that assumes there's room on the street and there aren't a bunch of cars parked there. We're now going to have the driver park in the middle of the street, go up and get the bins and take them down.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I'm assuming they want them to be taken back up because where we have elderly individuals who can't do that. We've been told the drivers are going to do that while the trucks sit there and idle. Right. So where we can move the needle in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is on the transportation side and do a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'whole lot more there. We're doing a lot with our buildings, and I commend our Climate Action Office for the work they're doing there. We're doing a little bit on the transportation side, but there's so much more and that's where you can see the needle moved significantly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'More than what we will do with the way this program is being structured. I don't disagree that we should encourage people to compost. I have a compost bin in my backyard. I've been using that for years. But the reality is we're creating a forever fee that Denver citizens are going to have to pay at a time when'",
        "'speaker_2': 'citizens across our city are being hit with other increases, not to mention the cost of living, housing, food. And so I, I am bringing this forward as a way to lighten the blow on our citizens of Denver. And so I just wanted to explain that, and I'll have another one in just a minute.'",

Council President Very briefly, I want to remind the council that we are not voting on the bill itself, and I respect that there are people on this body who have differing views about this policy. This particular vote is on an amendment that would turn off the entire solid waste program as we know it, with a'",

They would have a lot of time to plan because we would see the trends and whatever situation occurs in five years at a potential sunset, they could renew the program'",
        "'speaker_6': ', as has been done many times, like with the downtown lower downtown historic district. Or they can come up with a financial plan to to resume covering it under the general fund. I don't think it's I don't think it's accurate to say that we would be leaving them without a plan.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'To have that review period there. There doesn't need to be a forever fee. If we are able to see that this does change behaviors in the desired way, then it's not like we're planning. It's not like we don't have to plan to incorporate the cost of doing this into our budget.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We just might be able to incorporate that cost in a different way where it's not exactly a fee on the customer, where it's just part of the way that we do business. And so I do think that it's important that not only do we have a sunset, but that every single year I think we should be evaluating'",
        "'speaker_3': 'if the change has. Changed behaviors in the desired way and know our progress every step of the way. I don't think that in five years it just poof, like out of thin air disappears. I think that the agency, if the agency is responsible, then they are planning, they are assessing the metrics annually.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we will know every step of the way what needs to be done if we need to course correct, if we need to renew it or if we need to modify it. So I think this is a good amendment and I will be supporting it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you.'",

Some of that has changed where the managers of agencies have been given that authority to increase fees.

        "'speaker_6': 'You know, the primary responsibility that Dottie has when managing any fee, because this is a fee, is to adhere to the table requirements and ensure that the fee does not exceed the and is lined up with the cost of service and meets those legal standards.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think that this is a fee as a fee. This is very appropriate for Dottie to be doing that. We have other pieces in place. The bill requires biannual reports on revenue and expenditures. The Council. There is a required cost of service study before any fee would change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'There are lots of protections in place. There are places where council overlaps with that to keep track of this. But at the end of the day, the fee has to cover the service and it cannot exceed that. This is not revenue generation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'This is a fee to cover service. And so inserting. So I think that I think that inserting council into that decision making process versus the appropriate places where I believe this bill puts council and allows council authority and oversight, I think that's the right way to go is as written with the reporting.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I think that it would not be appropriate here to move that authority on setting the fee that is based on those legal requirements and TABOR and the cost of service study to ensure that it lines up they're out of date.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so that reason I will be voting no and would ask my colleagues to vote no as well. Thank you, Council President.'",

I on this body at least, I am very reluctant to give up and surrender any city council authority over the things that affect the people of this city. We should retain the ability, the authority, to look at these fees and to measure them against the study and analysis that's done by Dottie over that'",
        "'speaker_6': 'period and determine whether the fees should be that much or should we look at the level of service instead of putting it on autopilot? We did that with the wastewater fees, and I think that was a big mistake.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We did that with the wastewater fees back in 2016 and we put them on autopilot. I think it's a gauge to Denver Boulder's CPI. Which is not a good measure to for construction. But look at what inflation is doing this year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know that this fee isn't based on CPI, but it's gauged on what the director of Dottie feels should be the level of service. And I think that that should be a decision that rests with this council. We're setting the initial fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Why would we surrender the authority and the ability? To approve or disapprove, disapprove of future fee increases. We do this with the Golf Enterprise Fund. The fee increases for those and for parks comes to this council as it should.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Has various fees. Look at it in ordinance, primarily license fees. Almost all the license fees are in ordinance. The charter requires actually that we have license fees, an ordinance. There's a couple of other places what council said to be an ordinance because they're subject to change by council.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'If you have a question, go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No amount of press actually comments. I called this out for a vote earlier today, so I wanted to discuss why I'm voting no on publication. I why this proposal has been through a lot of thought and development. I don't believe it's well-structured.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not likely to produce the results that we want. First, the city has never done a complete and comprehensive educational campaign among our customers on how to recycle or compost and divert from their trash bins. We shouldn't even be thinking about imposing fees to supposedly incentivize people to do something that is unclear to them on how to'",
        "'speaker_6': 'do it. How about giving people very clear tutorials on what goes in the Green Bay, what goes in a purple bin and goes in the black bin and seeing the results. Second, even with sparse public education on this, our customers in the residential trash program already are doing much of what we ask of them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No constituent has ever asked me for weekly recycling, but my office has helped them upgrade their purple cards to the 95 gallon size and in many cases to get a second recycling cart. It is a waste of money and resources, not to mention harmful to the environment, to have to buy twice as many recycling trucks to drive'",
        "'speaker_6': 'this entire city every week instead of every two weeks for weekly recycling, when in most cases we'll be collecting only half every week instead of the full carts every other week. We heard in committee two weeks ago that the Solid Waste Division workforce currently has a 28% vacancy rate, and that's down from a 35% workforce shortage in'",
        "'speaker_6': 'January. At that rate of hiring, it would take until January 2024 to get to 100%. Even for the current program today, without accounting for having to hire 22 more workers to go to weekly recycling. And we heard in public comment earlier this evening how our crews are struggling to maintain even the current schedule.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We should not be charging for a service that we can't not yet provide today. Save the money and the carbon footprint by sticking with biweekly recycling, by deploying 95 gallon purple cards or second cards to households that need them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Third, our residential solid waste collections make up only 18% of what goes to the landfill from this city. Fully half of what gets dumped comes from construction and demolition activities. The other 32% comes from these large multifamily complexes and commercial and retail disposal.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I showed the committee two weeks ago the photos. I took, the dumpsters in the many apartment complexes and the office and retail plazas in my district. The photos are available in the council files on this bill at the public, which is to to go and view them easily.'",
        "'speaker_6': '50 to 75% of what was in those dumpsters was recyclable or compostable. I cannot ask the people who already are largely doing the right thing by filling one or two of the recycle bins to pay up to 252 bucks a year.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'While we are not mandating diversion from the 82% of the market that throws such an enormous amounts of needless waste into the landfill, instead, I advocate remove the fee we now charge for compost collection and delay consideration of charging for trash collection for at least a year to see the benefits of actually educating the public on what'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we want them to do. We've seen that cities with a high diversionary have charges for residential trash. A correlation is not causation. There's no evidence that the fee is what's causing it. In fact, some of those cities like Portland mandate recycling of demolition and construction debris, and that's what's moving their needle.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You could charge many of our households 100 bucks a month and they wouldn't be able to divert much more. Only by mandating recycling of construction and demolition, debris and diversion from commercial buildings and large multi-family residential can meaningfully make change.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Finally. Madam President, I do not have great faith in the promise of a discount program for lower income households. Many of my constituents are renters and they live in Brentwood and Harvey Park Valley, and they live in single family homes and small unit residential.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know that we're geared up to do outreach to them. But to many of them, I believe, will fall into the cracks of the landlords who already provide the largest card and will simply add 21 bucks to the monthly rent.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And this is in a city with rising rents. I worked last week with a retired city engineer to crunch some numbers based on the published figures of what goes into our landfill and Denver's greenhouse gas emissions in 2020.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Solid waste produced only 2%, 2% of Denver's greenhouse gases. The city's residential customers contributed only 18% of that 2%. Fully two thirds of Denver's greenhouse gases come from comes from buildings and 30% comes from cars, busses, airplanes and, yes, trash collection trucks.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My engineer friend calculated that if all those customers diverted their recyclable or compostable waste from the landfill, there would be a reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions of five and a half. 10 billion with a B of 1%.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If global emissions were measured in the length of a football field, the reduction would be to ten millions of one inch. That's a difference that cannot even be measured in the real world, only on paper. I cannot ask people who are struggling this year with eight and a half percent inflation, $5 a gallon gas, the prospect of'",
        "'speaker_6': 'higher utility bills through xcel's upcoming time of day pricing, plus more fees potentially on the November ballot to pay up to 252 bucks a year for this. In committee, I said, it feels like we're swatting a fly with a cannon.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'After seeing these calculations, it feels like we're swatting a fly with a cannonball the size of the earth. So my vote tonight is with the struggling households of this city trying to maintain their affordability in the face of this year's extraordinary economic distress.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I ask my colleagues to consider this and at least to think about delaying implementation this program for a year. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you for for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Many of those reasons. I do just want to give everyone a heads up that I will be proposing an amendment. I've been working with the city attorney to try and figure out how to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Equitably exclude our.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Most vulnerable neighborhoods and people who've been in their homes for over 20 years, so that we make sure that we're protecting our elders, protecting people who are experiencing involuntary displacement and not making them.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jump through more hoops while.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They're already jumping through hoops for our other rebate programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On property taxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or any of our benefit programs that many people are using right now. So just putting that on everyone's radar, that that will be coming. If this does get.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Published next week.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Council members said about the council member Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Is it okay to ask some questions?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure we are in the questions and comments, period. So go ahead, please.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Well, somebody from daddy I have some questions on the program. The first one is we heard earlier in public comment that the landfill doesn't generate greenhouse gas because it's captured and somehow used for electricity. Can can someone address that?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Knowing all of my kids.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Bruce Frank, Executive Director of the Office of Climate Action, Sustainability and Resiliency. We have received that question before, and I was able to ask the the folks in environmental quality who actually run the contract for the landfill. And they told me that 30% of the methane that is generated at the landfill is currently captured.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Their renewable natural gas system.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you very much for that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Next. You might have this as well. I've always heard that. Right now, we have about 30,000 homes in paying for composting in our program. And I saw something online from a constituent that said, that's not right. It's 18,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you give me the correct figure, please?'",
        "'speaker_3': '30,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A third.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'About 30,000. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So for the public, I mean, just the lowly project manager with 30.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right. Thank you. And as far as our composting program, I have heard from a number of constituents who have long backyard composting. Can you tell me the difference? My understanding is the city's compost program allows you to put far more things into compost.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that correct or incorrect?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Definitely. So the city's composting program is an industrial composting program.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So we accept like meat, dairy, bones, all these things you can put into a backyard compost pile. We encourage everyone to do both.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you for that. Now, as regards the program that's being proposed, it was proposed for an October implementation date. My understanding is we're now looking at January one. What I would like to know is on January one, what percentage of our homes will have their compost bins?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So at that time, we'll be in the midst of rolling out compost carts to the first phase of residents. That service won't start for them until about end of February for the first 100,000 homes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So that's.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Some more. We're getting close to two thirds.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah, about thirds of the compost customers will have their carts within the first quarter of the year. Anyone who does not have our service, even if they have the carts, will receive a credit on their on their invoice for the inconvenience of the rollout.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when their service starts, their credit will be removed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And have you set the dollar figure on that inconvenience figure?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We're looking at about $3 a month in order for that cost of service.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'When will the rest of the homes have their composting?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So the full rollout will be complete.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'By mid 2023.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Let's see. So talk has been from the dais that we're instituting a forever fee. We already have a forever fee that people are paying out of their out of the, you know, per person, out of the general fund through a variety of taxes.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What does that amount to now per single family home? What does it cost to serve? Service. What we're doing now. And I see that you would like to get back to me on that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll get back to you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would. Complicated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, it is. I understand that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But I think it's irrelevant. I'd like to know. And the last.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I get what my question is. I'm guessing you need to get back to me on this. What would it cost.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If we.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Offered the new services for free until the point when everybody has their compost bins? So if you could get back to me with that fee, I'd appreciate very much that number.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilmember Kimmich.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you. Council President, I really appreciate the fact we're on first reading tonight. I had hoped to defer most of my comments until the public hearing and the debate on second reading. But a number of claims and concerns have been raised.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think it's important for our community that's watching tonight to hear all the the both sides of the story, even as we just vote in first reading. So I'm asking for a little patience. This will be debating this again next week.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But just a few things. One of the things I've heard described both tonight and in other conversations is that Denver doesn't have any fee for trash today and that our residents do not pay for trash. And that is factually inaccurate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I need to really clarify. This city has 700,000 plus residents in it and just under half of them live in multi-family housing that is paying for their trash service today. Those are residents of our city, their constituents.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They are families who live in our city. And they are paying their taxes. They're paying their property taxes. They're paying taxes through their rent. They're paying their sales tax when they shop. They're paying all those taxes. And they are also paying for their trash collection.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The median income of those living in apartments in our city who are paying for their trash service today is around $50,000 a year. Today in Denver, we have a fee for our solid waste customers. You just heard a minute ago 30,000 of them are paying for compost.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So it is just factually inaccurate to say that residents aren't paying for trash day. Half of our residents are paying for their.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Trash.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And another 15% or so are actually paying to do the right thing. So the remaining residents are really the ones we're debating and what is the equity of the system we have today? So I just want to run a few figures by folks, which is that 87% of the customers that we serve in this program, they live'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in single family or duplex living and the median income in the single family homes, that's renters and owners together. That's the median income for both, whether they rent or own. The median income is $108,000 in those in those products, and it's in the high $80,000 a year range for the duplexes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So what we have today is a system where our taxpayers, our apartment dwellers are actually subsidizing the cost of trash collection for a much higher median income set of residents. That is the situation today. And so, you know, I asked the question, so if we had a set of residents who got all the water that they wanted'",
        "'speaker_3': 'in our city right from their taps, and they could water their lawns as much as they wanted and they could, you know, fill their swimming pools as much as they wanted. And they paid no difference. But then we had another set of residents who was actually paying for the amount of water they used, and they actually were'",
        "'speaker_3': 'subsidizing the cost for the water of the other set of residents. Would we think that's fair? I don't think that we would. That is what we have is a solid waste system today. And so when we think about what is fair going forward, what is equitable going forward, it's really important to first ask, is the system we'",
        "'speaker_3': 'had today fair and equitable? And I would argue that it is not. We have a many we have a majority we have a majority of residents in our city today paying some form of cost for their trash, whether it's in the multifamily arena or whether they're paying to compost, majority are paying something.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's actually the minority of households that are not. The other thing I think that's really important to bring up is to remind folks, as we think about the concerns we have for those in our community who struggle, it's not to say that there are not residents of single family homes or duplexes or small apartment complexes who might'",
        "'speaker_3': 'have financial constraints. We know that to be true, and we have a whole set of tools built into this policy to protect those households from any negative impacts. So just to throw out some of the numbers, the rebate program that this is included in this ordinance will serve households, for example, for individuals earning up to 56 I'm'",
        "'speaker_3': 'sorry, $58,600 a year. So almost $60,000 a year for a family of four is provided a rebate. And these are among the lowest fees in the country. So I think it is really important for us to debate equity, but I'm going to challenge us to debate the inequities in our current system and also to be very transparent'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that we have a rebate program for those earning less than this income in this program. So really now what we are debating is even a smaller subset of households and whether it is appropriate for them to throw away all the trash in the landfill that they want subsidized by the others with no accountability to our climate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so that's the question I think we're debating, and I think it's important that all those facts be out there. You know, one of the things that was said earlier, it was mentioned about a forever fee and it was the it was mentioned a cannonball the size of the earth.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I personally would like to live on a forever earth. One of the things that Councilman Flynn raised with boiling all of the greenhouse gas savings down to a percentage. I can't speak to the math that his engineer did, but I'll speak to the math and the and the science behind a different way of looking at it'",
        "'speaker_3': ', which is that for us to meet, our solid waste goal is worth keeping 600,000 cars off the road. So I ask you, as we prepare for more 100 degree days. As the newspaper reminded us that probably only about 30 or 33% of the residents in this city have air conditioning and they are at serious risk of heat'",
        "'speaker_3': 'related illness and death. On those 100 degree days, if we can take the equivalent of 600,000 cars of greenhouse gas emissions out of the climate, why we would not do that? That is the question for us to debate if you don't want to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is a valid policy position. But to say that this does not have a climate impact or that that climate impact doesn't matter is to ignore the science of climate. The best climate policy is every climate policy that we can pass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This is our behavior locally in the city and county of Denver. We can control it. I cannot control oil and gas extraction happening on the western slope. I cannot control ozone floating in from California, oil and gas or industry.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I cannot control what happens internationally. But we can control the equivalent of 600,000 cars emissions simply by not putting proxies from Amazon in the landfill, which every week is happening in our city because recycling bins are full or because compost bins aren't available and we don't have a practice of doing the right thing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So those are the questions we're debating. We'll talk more about some of the operational claims and maybe some of the other details next week. But just wanted to put some foundation out there before we vote tonight on how important it is to move this to second reading so that we can hear more from our community, both about'",
        "'speaker_3': 'what's hard about this, but also what's necessary, hard and necessary sometimes go together. In our world particularly, we are talking about our one earth that we want to last forever. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Next up, we've got Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm not going to repeat what I shared earlier, but I just want to say that when you look at what we're trying to do and Councilwoman Kinney just talked about the inequity of this system and the way it's set up, it has been like this as long as I've been in the city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Anything over eight units have always paid for private trash pickup. And anything below that, the city has picked up the trash and that is built into your your taxes that you pay for your property if you're a renter that's passed on to you by the landlord.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I have played a role in trying to bring different folks to do presentations before my colleagues to look at how we can be doing transportation differently. Again. That's where we can move the needle. The city council had an opportunity to express their voice when the I-70 project was being constructed and being widened to the number of lanes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'that it has today. Some of us tried to impact that project. Unfortunately, we were not successful. That added a lot more cars on the highway. So, you know where we talk about where we can really have significant impact in reducing greenhouse gases.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's where we can try to get people out of their cars and create a greater opportunity for mass transit. I think you all know that the state legislature approved funding for front range rail, which would connect Fort Collins all the way to Colorado Springs and tie into our RTD system, will be able to move the needle as'",
        "'speaker_2': 'we can, get people who commute back and forth and spend a significant amount of time on the highway adding to the air quality challenges that we have. And, you know, this this is an important conversation in terms of encouraging people to compost.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's what we're adding to the equation here, trying to get more people to compost and those who have not been recycling to recycle. And instead of just adding that and figuring out how much that cost and the figures that we've been given is that to just add this new.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This new system or this new cost to the system. It's 13,964,000. $768.10. 13 million. 13 point almost $14 million. Right. But what we're going to do is charge 25 million. But that's the that's today's cost in 23. We've been told it's $33,000,483.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And. So we're instead of just looking at the compost piece being added, we're folding the whole program under this this new fee. And so when you talk about the end of the what we were proposing as a sunset, these are costs that have been covered by the city the whole time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the anticipation was it would be put into like an enterprise fund. And that's where I think some folks were expressing concern about what do you do? You put it back into the general fund or what. But to Councilman Flynn's point, the council could figure it out at that point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just think we're. Pushing so much of these fees and costs onto single family households and everybody under seven units to cover this cost, to create a whole new program that could be significantly cheaper if we just added composting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I am not supporting this tonight. I tried to, you know, come up with some ways to lighten the impact on the folks who will be bearing the brunt of this program. And unfortunately, it was not successful in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think the timing of all of this is just couldn't be worse. And so I will not be voting for this tonight. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Clark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Council President. Again, I'll save the bulk of my comments for next week on final reading and when we have the opportunity for the public to weigh in during the courtesy hearing but did want to hit on a couple of things, Councilman Cashman brought up a good question about the amount of methane at the landfill.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I just want to put a flag in another conversation that we need to be having, which is why are we only capturing 30% of that? We need to be making the investments to capture more, if not all of that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But at the end of the day, all of that is methane being created. And even if we capture it, instead of flaring it off where it's just going and burning and creating that emission there it's being captured, is being put in a pipe where it's burned somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So it's not a sustainable solution to our climate crisis. It's a better option than just burning it right there. But the best option is to not have more methane being created. And the way the path of that is to not throw things away that we have another use for it, that we can reuse, that we can recycle'",
        "'speaker_6': 'to minimize the amount of methane being created through that process that then either has to get cleared off or in the best case scenario at that point, which is not a best case scenario, has to go and be burned somewhere else.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But we really need to again, this is a yes, and we need to be doing all of these things. We needed to be doing all of these things a decade ago or two decades ago to not be in the situation with our climate that we are right now.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'is what we have to do as a city. And I know that there's been some made of, you know, what it would have might impact if it's too small. We as a city, we can't solve a global climate crisis by ourselves.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But if we throw up our hands and say, well, my impact that we can that I can do as a city is too small. So I just won't do it. I won't do anything. That's how we fail as a planet.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'that. And so I just I don't want that to get lost in this. Oh, this is too small from that perspective. And a lot of people said that when we brought forward all of the climate work that we did with the Climate Task Force was, you can't solve this as a city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So just don't just don't try. It's too hard. Well, it's not a convenient truth that we're up against. It is inconvenient. It is hard.

        "'speaker_6': 'outcomes that we are already starting to see today. Two last things that I just want to flag outside of the climate impact, because with that emergency happening is very easy for all conversations about the environment to go immediately to emissions and climate.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But just from a materials standpoint, we are taking things to our little blip on this planet in the long arc of human history. We're here for this moment. We're taking a tonne of materials and we're just burying it forever in the ground and materials that could be used for generations beyond us, that can be reused, that can'",

But the numbers that we generally have is 181 between 270 970, 280,000 tons that we are putting in the landfill from our systems every'",
        "'speaker_6': 'year. So I wanted to quickly look at that. When you take out that 75% of our waste room could be composted, recycled, we're putting that meters rolling in well north of 100,000 tons of material that we are putting into the landfill today, this year that doesn't have to go there.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I've been on this council for eight years. That's 800,000 tons of material. It didn't have to go to the landfill. That will sit there for hundreds and thousands of years creating methane, creating problems, and being materials that no one after us.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that moment of use can use 800,000 tons in my eight years for some people in their first term. You've only contributed 300,000 that.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'To do better. We have a mandate to do better. This is these are the decisions that have.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'That's too hard. And not taking a second to say we. Yeah, it's hard. But we can no longer. We can no longer. That can no longer be acceptable. That on on my watch, with my vote, I continued to let 100,000.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Over 100,000. Tons go into a place that it didn't need to and create the impacts that it's creating.

        "'speaker_6': 'need to do to fight this. I would really ask that we move this on from first reading to final, even if in the end that doesn't change your vote or your decision. Let us get to that public hearing and voted out of office reading into final consideration next week.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Clarke. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think your council president I, I don't want to repeat everything that Councilmember Clarke just said, so I'll just. I mean, really, tonight's vote is just to publish this for next week's consideration. So I'll be brief. Generally refraining from comments about preserving our habitability on this planet like Councilmember Clarke has just eloquently said.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Um, so just a couple of things briefly. Residents have asked council to slow this process. They've asked me to ask council to slow the process that is moving forward too quickly. Just for what it's worth, this is the single track, single topic I've tracked the longest.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've followed this kind of conversation about pace you throw since before I was even a candidate. I'm excited to hear from the public next week and to finally vote on this issue. So pass or fail, it is time to bring this conversation to a vote.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I sure would like to hear from the public before we make that decision. And so I like Councilmember Clark say that even if you were not in favor of the, you know, the the the concept, please allow the public to to voice their opinions next week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I also want to talk briefly about the things that I've heard from perfect ten residents. There are two major concerns. First, the vast majority of perfect town residents pay for trash collection, but do not benefit from it. You know, most of the people who live in and district tend to live in multi-family buildings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Many of them are large multi-family buildings, you know, hundreds or hundreds of units big. And these are the people who pay into the trash collection fee, as in they pay into the general fund, and they're subsidizing the fees for those single family residents and for small unit building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So as one of my colleagues has mentioned just a few minutes ago, who's saying that the single family homeowners are are are getting the the brunt of it? I would say it's the exact opposite. It's actually the apartment dwellers who are paying for trash collection, subsidizing trash collection and not getting it at all from the funds that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'they're. The fees that they're paying into the general fund are the. And yet the single family homeowners are benefiting from it. So I think this is only the most equitable thing to do for for for everyone, particularly considering we are the only city in the nation that are considering, you know, equity.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Speaking of equity, an equity structure for those who cannot afford, you know, just barely struggling financially in Denver. And and we will have an equity fee structure just for them. Sorry. Rebate structure just to them. The other thing that I want to say is that trash collection in some areas of District ten are frankly frustrating.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Specifically, there's there's a change of trash collection in Kyra's park that moved the collection from the alley to the street. I have had lots of conversations with dotty leadership and and, you know, the waste collection leadership. And I have sent lots of Congress residents to to that diary leadership specifically for them to directly address some of the'",
        "'speaker_7': 'concerns. And frankly, the folks in Congress are still frustrated by it. But based on my conversations with with party leadership, it is my understanding that the change was because of efficiency. Put another way, we add, as has already been mentioned earlier tonight in this conversation, we are short workers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'While we're short workers in part, you know, we're in the great resignation or as the Biden administration wants us to call it, the great upgrade. But partly we're short workers because we don't have funds to be more competitive with a recruitment retention process and to be more competitive with a way to to make our workers most effective'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and efficient in the trash collection process. You know, we also don't have the funds to be greener with our trash collection itself. So as Councilmember Flynn had mentioned, you know, our trash trucks are contributing to those greenhouse gases.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I mean, we could if we had the funds experiment with electric vehicle trash trucks and this fee will allow us to live our values and and electrify our or at least test or electrify electrification of our trash collection.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And and still make sure that we have a process for people's waste to go where it needs to go. Waste as in reduce, reuse and recycle. Hopefully we'll just reduce. But but if we do need to send something out of our home, it can go to the appropriate place for trash, recycling or composting.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Those electric trucks, along with a better fee structure, will help us more fully staff our trash collection activities and live our values. What's more, we could with if we had appropriate funds, we could consider trash trucks that are appropriately sized to return trash collection to alleys and neighborhoods where it makes sense, like perhaps Congress part.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I will probably say more next week, but but I'm encouraged that I feel like our colleagues will at least move this forward to publication. I hope that is the case and I hope we have a more robust discussion next week.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Council President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Flynn. Backup.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. Since I kicked this off, I appreciate the opportunity to wrap up and offer a little bit of rebuttal and clarification and thank you to council members. Can you and Cashman and Clark and Hines spoke with especially Councilman Hines.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Let me kick off with just a few brief rebuttal remarks. First of all. The reason that multifamily and commercial properties. Multifamily. Eight and above. The reason that they have to pay private haulers for their own trash collection isn't that the city doesn't want to service them or wouldn't service them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But the state legislature many, many years ago bowed to the private trash hauling businesses and mandated passed legislation that prohibits Denver from serving them. I wish we would serve them and then we could all cover it out of the general fund.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Right. That's the reason. It's not that they're doing some favor for people who live in single family or small multifamily. It's that the state lawmakers have said you can't serve them. The the private industry has to serve them.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That's the reason for it. Thank you to Councilman Cashman for bringing out the 30% figure, 30% of the methane at at the dad's facility, Denver Arapahoe Disposal site. And we view that on a tour. Many of us. Several years ago, they convert the methane emissions to electricity.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Goes back into the Excel grid. That's pretty good, too. Okay. But I made note here that councilman, that that reduces my five and a half ten billions of 1% by yet another 30%. And finally, Councilwoman Kenny, to respond and also to Councilman Clark, there's a false narrative that's being generated up here inadvertently, as I suppose that those'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of us who don't support charging a fee don't want to see increased diversion from the landfill. We do. We want to see it. We simply don't believe that our failure to impose a fee for our our program is the reason that it is the way it is.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We will probably see this November because I believe it's already certified for the ballot. There is an initiative on the ballot that would mandate exactly what I was saying needs to happen. And Councilman Clark, every single dumpster I looked into had 50 to 75% recyclable or compostable material in it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I suppose that can be overwhelmed. That 30 to 82 year total of 82% of what goes to landfill is probably greatly consists of construction and demolition debris. That's why Portland, Oregon, has such a high diversionary because they mandate that it's not because they charge a fee to their homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So those of us who don't support this, we want the same thing that the people who support this want. We want people to divert as much as they can. We simply don't accept that it's our failure to charge you a fee.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'That is the reason. In fact, I've had constituents call me and say, if you're going to charge me 21 bucks a month for my black card. Why am I bothering to recycle anymore? I'll just put everything in the black card.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I would. I don't want to see that either. I want to see us delay a fee for at least a year, do the kind of robust education that we've never done, tell people. Does this thing go in the green card?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Does this go on to purple or does it go in a black car? Educate them first and see how they respond without charging them a fee. In this godawful time of eight and a half percent inflation of Excel, a time of day pricing and other fee increases that are coming down the pike.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Flynn and I will go ahead and add in a few brief comments around this. The first thing is, if a councilmember tonight votes to move this forward and have it ordered published, I want to be clear that that doesn't mean that on final that council member is going to vote affirmatively for this bill.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And. Really in listening to my colleagues, I'm thinking about the residents. A lot of folks talked about the planet, and I understand that. I understand it innately. I am a wildlife biologist. I went to school for this, but I also am an educator and it is next to impossible to get people to change their behaviors.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If we don't tell them why, if we don't explain to them very clearly and explain again and again and again, because there's a certain amount of privilege that just goes along with really understanding these issues and getting into it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'A lot of folks are struggling to just survive and stay in Denver, and as my colleagues kind of brought up their different pros and cons around it, that robust education plan is so important and to really implement that and work that plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the other piece is that there was an article that came out in The Denver Post today that according to the city of Denver, approximately 30% of our homes in Denver lack air conditioning. We used to have a swamp cooler.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It used to work to cool our homes. There are changes in the climate that we know that not mitigating trash is one of the issues. But is it time to do that now? Or is the time to do the education plan?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Make sure that we can help support our residents so that they can stay in their homes and be comfortable and be at a place to even hear the education that we as a city are going to put out, or are we going to pass over that and put another fee on them when they might be struggling with'",
        "'speaker_0': 'credit card debt, rising cost of living in Denver, inflation of student loan debt, etc. There's a lot of bills that our constituents are struggling with, and I'm really struggling with putting another fee on them on top of this without that robust education plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so, again, members might vote affirmatively to move this forward to the final reading and the courtesy public hearing that we are going to have along with that bill. But I want to be clear that that doesn't mean that that council member is in support of the bill, because some of us, as you can see up here'",
        "'speaker_0': ', are still struggling with the impact that this is going to have on homeowners in the city and county of Denver, coupled with. An unease as to Dottie being able to even secure the trucks that are going to be necessary to roll out and implement this plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I've been told by some city employees that sometimes it can be 2 to 3 and a half years to get fully orders in and secured. And then on top of that as having severe vacancies within Dottie as well to implement this program.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'I don't know the history there. I just would assume that at some point it was split. It's a very large lot. And as Fran mentioned, the south side is is more or less just the empty lot that's connected.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. A friend. How often do we rezone properties into a different letter of the code? So we're going from, as you see, to as you be.

        "'speaker_6': 'Are.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We only allow it because of that language in Blueprint Denver that talks about the pattern. So we only recommend approval or we support the cases where we see a pattern. So we see that even when there might be some see actually we see that there is enough of these lots that have more of like the pattern of'",
        "'speaker_5': 'the be. We also are not supportive when it involves demolishing a house. So we've had cases where the houses smack in the middle and we try not to encourage demolishing. So but in this case, it's clearly all the way up the north.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So you'd be pretty easy to develop south. So we think it's a because there is the pattern and because the house is not in the middle, we think that it is possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Just one last thing. Not necessarily a question, but a comment. In the staff report, it says that the the route, the RTT routes 21 and to 12 run on 12 hour and 15 minute had ways. They do not they run 30 minute headways.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And that might have been 15 in the past. But with the service challenges RTD has had, I believe they cut back, but they're currently on a half half hour headways.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I know that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Maybe staff could just check the current RTD schedules on things like those half hour headways are not frequent transit. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Live on the lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes, that is right. That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I'm just. I guess that would be something that would be discussed in the site planning process of this, but never.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be able to permit the edu the owner needs to be. The owner needs.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To reside on the lot. Yeah. Okay. So based on the information we've been provided tonight, the plan that's in place is not possible.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I mean, for what I understand and I'll leave this to the applicant, but it's him and his friend that they're going to once they split the lot, each one is going to live in one of the lots.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So then you would have the owners living on site. So then they would be able to build the area after.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. So it would be two separate permits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I guess I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Understand what you're saying. So just one last question. I guess to clarify then, is there a. Is there specific language in Blueprint? I understand.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That there's specific language around.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Situation we have here. Is there specific language improved in Blueprint that addresses spot rezonings?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I don't think there's specific language and maybe I could ask Andrew if he can confirm, but I don't think there is specific language about what we signing. But this wouldn't be a really spot rezoning because we're following like the guidance group in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So it's well, like the fact that it's one rezoning doesn't mean that it's not on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But so it is about rezoning. It's just that blueprint. Denver hasn't an exception for this specific kind of spot rezoning in it. If everything around it is us uses you as you see and worries on in one parcel to USB one, that's a spot rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's a few inside.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Oh, we've.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Changed the microphone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Andrew Webb, Community Planning and Development. I'm one of the team leads for our rezoning team. Typically, I would I would think of us of a spot rezoning where we're making a significant change that is in conflict with a plan, guidance for a specific site rezoning an individual property consistent with planning guidance would not qualify as a spot'",
        "'speaker_8': 'rezoning and blueprint does recommend as as Fran noted, changing or acknowledging that existing zoning on a site may not be a match in terms of lot size. So Councilmember Flynn talked about the letter at the end of the of the zoning description.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Those refer to specifically the minimum lot size for development. And in this case, it's fairly clear that the much larger lot with development only on one side. And so according to blueprints, language about establishing different or changing minimum lot sizes, it would be consistent with that plan guidance and so therefore would not be what we would consider'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a spot zoning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. But the criteria that we have to look at for the uniformity of context is would create a situation where this is not a uniform context. But is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, the context the neighborhood context would not change. And that's I think that's what that's in reference to. The only thing that would change here would be the minimum lot size and that we applicants propose rezonings to change minimum lot size fairly frequently when their property doesn't actually match up with the zoning that exists.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so Blueprint has that language about, you know, if there is an existing pattern of of of lot sizes in that smaller that would be would would align with that smaller minimum lot size district then it is appropriate to rezone to those smaller lot sizes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so in this area we look at the pattern of loss and in a particular neighborhood and if we see a variety like we do in this particular location and a pattern of smaller lots, we would support a rezoning based on that language and blueprint.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Anyone can build the developers in Central Park. I've got developers in Platt Park who have built a house with an idea that the rule is in order to have two different leases or two separate groups living there. You have to live in one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But it has happen all the time in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That I've seen in.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Entire areas of Central Park that were developed by some a developer who was never going to live there with an idea that the rules around ideas were around who can reside there, not about who could build in 80 because they could build in 82 and then rent that entire thing to someone totally different.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I just can't rent to you in the front. I have to live in.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'One of them.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'No. So, I mean, anyone can build it. But once you primitive, like the person that lives in the area, you can you can move out and rent the whole house. Like, let's say I own a house in Central Park and I move out and I want to rent my house and I rent it to just one family'",
        "'speaker_5': '. Like what you're saying? So they. And for them to leave and use it. You can you can do that. That's not allowed. People do it. It's very difficult to enforce it, but it's not legally allowed.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They can read the entire thing. As long as I'm renting to one family that occupies the Adu and the house, they just can't rent the house to one person and rent the area to a second person.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You can rent like in theory, you're supposed to disable the edu, so you're supposed to take the gas lines and you're supposed to remove the. I think it's like a closet. It's something. That it's crazy. But you're supposed to look like and we've had cases here where the applicant had to do that and then come and resign'",
        "'speaker_5': 'because they didn't know. So we brought before you like cases where like I remember clearly one case, one person that she did that and she got in trouble because one of the neighbors kind of got her in trouble.'",

        "'speaker_7': 'any efficiencies. Secondly, Mr. Turner has told that short term rentals this year are impacting boutique hotel stays, to be exact. A quick check of the city's database of short term rentals shows that there are more than 300 stores already in the city park and Congress park neighborhoods within walking distance of the site, according to the city's SDR'",
        "'speaker_7': 'database. A luxury hotel is not needed in the area. I recently toured the property today and met residents who have not been contacted for housing. We are working to connect them.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'With resources, not Denver Urban or not.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Turner purchased the property. He told the city and county of Denver the residents and improvements will be made at the property instead. He made few, if any, repairs and was cited a handful of times for safety and health violations from the city and in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The photos of the property on a research watch of more than six years shows the individual willing to let the property fall to total disrespect. Mr. Turner has cited in 2019 for the kitchen being in disrepair and electrical being out of code and safety issue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Again, in 2019, the elevator was out of compliance. In 2020, cited for fire alarm issues, constant pest infestations of bedbugs and rats has also been an issue during several meetings with Congress neighbors R.A. and South City Park Arno.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. Tober admitted displacing current residents who depend on city issued housing vouchers, which all in motel access. Some are still living there without any new housing identified. The motel is on a bus line and is centrally located, so residents are able to access community based services and travel to and from work.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To shutter the motel would further victimize residents who call this home. Please vote no on this two.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening. Thank you for letting me talk here at 9:00 on a monday night, and thank you for engaging in this process. My name is Tim Swanson. I was born and raised in Denver. Proud to call this place my home.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five years ago, I moved into the neighborhood and live on the 1500 block of Saint Paul. Importantly, I live in the neighborhood. With my wife and two small children. We live about 200 yards from the island motel. Our block is an eclectic block.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Besides my family, there are other small other families of small children, long term residents, even tenants with leases. Since we moved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Five years ago, we have been waiting for a transformational project to change the all and to uplift the all in motel from its obvious blight and disrepair to something that the whole neighborhood can be proud of and enjoy.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For five years, the entire neighborhood has been waiting for this vote and for this project to move forward. As you know, the South City Park neighborhood has already voted in favor of this project twice, overwhelmingly. It's part of the materials that were submitted with you for approval.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This vote took place after the developer submitted the project, submitted the concept to questioning and to scrutiny from the neighborhood, people who have a vested interest. He made himself available and took anyone up on a phone call who called.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This project has numerous benefits to improve the safety of the neighborhood and will help remove a long standing negative stigma of Colfax and the All in motel that will retain the building's historic and unique character. And also provide lodging for out-of-town guests.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Importantly important, this can't.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Be lost that this developer's.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Local. He's not seeking to plant a best Western flag or American flag or some other cookie cutter hotel that is not unique to this neighborhood. He's here. He's local. All the neighbors in my neighborhood who have a vested interest in who live there are strongly supportive of this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are the ones who have to deal with the project or with the status of it now day to day, and we'll have to deal with it in the future. If there was ever a project for Tiff, I ask you all drive by, walk by.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tell me that this project isn't blighted and isn't deserving of Tiff. Because if not, I don't know why we have a tiff or urban renewal statute. It makes no sense. My family and my neighborhood, we strongly support this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We urge you to vote unanimously in favor of this project. Will move our neighborhood forward. Thank you.'",

I am very familiar with all in and I am speaking like Jeff before me said, against the approval of 20 2-0590. In the last three years, numerous people have been temporarily housed at all in and have received housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jesse Paris and myself have advocated for poor people and to people out of those four that we advocated for had gotten housing. Now, I, I am very familiar what the inside looked up like compared to the pictures. And I can say if this is that this is the owner and he would allow me, the tenant on our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'unhoused neighbors to live in these deplorable conditions. No, no. We do not need a luxury a luxury hotel. Urban renewal is the old fashioned name of. Gentrification. We do not. I do not believe in in in paying my taxpayer money towards this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what about the unhoused people that got displaced council? Do you understand that, that some of them are being displaced as far as Lakewood went down the street. They had the bus lines. Down the street was a 7-Eleven.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This was a perfect place, just like the Fusion studios a couple of years ago. That you guys. Approved up to be permanent housing. We need permanent housing from old motels. I, I am very upset with this. I live down the street on Park Avenue and called backs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And this these bids Colfax village is just trying to make everything luxury, luxury, luxury. When? Right now we are all suffering. We, you know, even people right now in low income housing are, you know, one step to this to the tent city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If you don't want tents in our city council, I would appreciate if you all vote no on this. Not just one person. Do the right thing. Remember, we can do better. Let's do better tonight. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'We are extremely close. This is something we are passionate about. And we unanimously support the proposed renovations for all in hotel. Brian Tauber purchased the Island Hotel with the intent to keep the classic landmark, improve the quality of the hotel and to benefit local neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Ryan needs city council approval to move forward with these hotel renovations. This project will add a hotel option for the region of Denver. Looking on Google Maps, you can see between the neighborhoods of Cole, Clayton, Park Hill, Whittier, Skyline City Park, South City Park, Congress Park, Montclair.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There are little to no hotels available. Given the amount of hospitals in the area, we would benefit from providing families and friends of patients staying at the hospitals with a place to stay when they visit their loved ones.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This project will also improve the beauty of the neighborhood. This project includes keeping the existing structure and adding an additional structure to increase capacity and improve the exterior of the buildings and remove this blight that we walk by every single day.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'This project will also add additional businesses along Colfax. As Bryan mentioned, he intends to add small businesses a coffee shop bakery. This brings in this business 1 to 1. It'll bring in additional businesses. This will help increase the safety.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And when we bring a child to our neighborhood, this will help us feel more safe in the area. In conclusion, we're all in for supporting Bryan Tauber in the hotel renovation. I urge city council to approve this project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you again for your time and your support for this renovation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker joining us virtually is Tyrese Howard.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Counsel. I'm curious, Howard. Excuse Action Network Member. I'm here to ask you all to vote against this bill, this proposed check and finance. I have known many people over the years that have stayed at the all in and time of desperation without housing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it has been one of the critical hotels that is accessible for folks who are needing that kind of an emergency housing situation. They have been more accessible in terms of, you know, folks that don't have IDs and the city as well as other service providers have utilized them a great deal for putting people in temporary hotel'",
        "'speaker_2': 'voucher situations to get rid of this hotel and turn it into a luxury apartment. Is baffling to me that. We are actually considering using our tax dollars, public tax dollars to destroy low income emergency housing and turn it into luxury hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That is literally what we talking about right now at a time in Denver when we have the largest housing crisis ever, when housing is the big issue we're talking about, when you have hundreds and thousands of folks on the streets and shelters and so on and so forth every day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is the biggest thing we're talking about. And meanwhile, it's before council to vote to turn one of the the viable options we have into a luxury a luxury hotel. This is very disturbing. I think it's really important to note also that even if all of the current residents of this hotel are moved into a great housing'",
        "'speaker_2': 'situation, which is much needed and very much.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hope, that that is something the city and partners can achieve in this time frame.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Even if that were to be the case, that doesn't change the situation that this is a a low income, a cheap, attainable, temporary housing option, that that is badly needed in our city that would then be gone, would be off the table, would no longer be an option.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We can't just be looking at the immediate situation. We have to be looking at the long haul. And the long haul we should be looking at is what what what is needed in this property. This property is needed to be retained as a quality property for low income folks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city could have bought this property in 2016. It should buy it now and retain it for low income people. And I ask that the city vote no on this and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Instead move to buying the island and turning it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Into low income housing. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Jason Costa in chambers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to talk to you guys tonight. I would like to start off by saying I come from a very large Italian family. We've made a lot of sausage in our days and this is quite an impressive process.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'A lot to us. I know from a macro level there's been a lot of good data and information presented of how this alliance with the City Youth Development Plan.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'How this generates jobs.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'How this reduces blight. But I just kind of wanted to address the micro aspect of this and the fact that it has overwhelming support from our Self City Park Neighborhood Organization. We attend meetings regularly. This also has strong support from the Congress Park Neighborhood Association as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And like I said before, you know, for the people that live on that street and in the surrounding blocks, this is a big deal for us. We live with this every single day.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And it will make this area a lot.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Whatever new vacation you're going to bring into the community? Okay. I don't care about this that there's the National Jewish Hospital, all that stuff. Everything's been rebuilt to suit one group of people. Gentrification is only for one class of people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I must say it again, like I said it last week. This only suits white people. White people. LGB. GQ People with a high paying jobs. That's what's here. That's what it supports. It does not support the black community that used to live in that area.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It used to go to East High School, used to be all around that area. It doesn't. What have you added? Like, you know, pushing our people out. You know, you push our black community out, you push our Hispanic community out, and you only bring in more.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'High paying, upper class white people. That's what this is for. Now, if the building is messed up, you only have to blame the owner if you're not bringing enough money to that area. Blame yourself. The city of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When you decide it's build I-70 and you took the tourism money from that area, then it became how it is. This is your fault. Not the city, not the people that live in the city, but the actual city.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well. And they decided to transform the city to suit financial needs. Make this building for what it is. We started building. He the humans there. You do not have a place with them. You know that. Thank you. Our next speaker.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'the hotel reading activity there, that shouldn't be happening on Kovacs or anywhere. I don't think that we want to continue that activity. And I think the surrounding neighbors. Deserve that. I think that. Overall positive redevelopment of this historic building is needed and appreciated.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And the restaurant and the bakery and the spaces being offered for small business and artists, I think is important. I think there is no walkable hotel. It is time for people that are attending events or productions there. I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'National Jewish deserves to have a hotel within walking distance for visitors. I think the neighbors need a hotel for guests to stay and be able to walk. I think people going to City Park Jazz need a place to stay.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Of the building.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because I witnessed it firsthand. People have almost got electrocuted to death in that building. The elevator was very. So the building is definitely, definitely in disrepair. What I would like to be made into another fusion studio or something of the sort, because we have a housing crisis.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Instead of turning into luxury apartments like Howard spoke earlier. We have a housing crisis in luxury apartments in the area of Denver. It's not a solution or a means toward a solution to our housing crisis that we are under.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is just more gentrification as usual. Urban renewal is just sort of for all the undesirables out. It's a lot of keep talking about crime.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's unsafe over here because they allow this area to go into blighted conditions just so they can have a reason to tear it down and build luxury hotel 1881 room hotel. That's not going to be for people that are currently experiencing homelessness.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I'll just give a quick summary. The reasons are, number one, we do feel public private partnerships are essential to Denver's future and in particular with regard to this project. Number two, this investment group has appropriately engaged with us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They've demonstrated a commitment to working with the R and O's and community investments with neighborhood organization.

This project will provide unique public spaces along the Colfax Avenue corridor, and the neighborhoods serving amenities are to be recognized. And finally, innovative design and creating multiple uses in the South City Park neighborhood make sense.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Uses such as hotel accommodations, which we have heard a number of times are in need. A caf and a pool with some access to our neighborhood will be permitted in an area of the city requiring activation. And in closing, I'd just say, you know, we've been promised a number of things over decades with regard to this property'",

        "'speaker_1': 'If you live in a tent. If you live in a shelter. And you get apartment. That's luxury. I don't know what y'all are thinking about, but it seemed to me that y'all are perpetuating the homeless crisis for every.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Valerie. I know. However, the city council is going to be running for other offices or they no longer can run for these offices. But the point is, the city could have bought that building and they could do it now if another monument or anything like that and put low, affordable housing on that property.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'And really think about what that means. One of them is light. Unfortunately, people have talked about how this is a blight in the neighborhood, suggesting that it spoils or damages the neighborhood with its existence. It has been an asset to the community to, again, as people have mentioned before.'",

This is called facts, and we are displacing people at alarming rates. We are forgetting the integrity definition originally, which is moral, upstanding ness.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And here you are choosing to this place further and continuing to ask yourselves why we have a housing crisis to begin with. So I urge the city instead reconsider purchasing this building and allowing it to remain a viable option for people as it has for so long and do not continue to contribute to the displacement of our'",

        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. Good evening. My name is Emily Clark. I'm a Denver resident, and I live on Monroe Street. I'm here today to express my strong support of the redevelopment plan for the Allen Hotel. I live in the South City Park neighborhood in which this property is located.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I truly believe this plan will contribute many benefits to our community and is consistent with the East Central Area Plan. It will reduce blight, become a catalyst for other improvements, and provide services that are currently missing. It will create many jobs and provide an important piece of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Infrastructure.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Carfax and the Blue Bird District.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All while preserving an historic structure.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I was able to visit the Austin, Texas Hotel managed by New Waterloo, the same company that will oversee this hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It was a beautiful building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Well maintained and included a thriving restaurant and retail store. If this hotel is to be anything like it, we'd be incredibly lucky. I would like to encourage City Council to approve the redevelopment plan as well as the associated funding mechanisms.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for your time tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Lenny Sorrels.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Members of Denver City Council. My name's Lenny Cyrus. I live in the Congress Park neighborhood. I'm requesting that you vote no on the tax increment financing proposition for 3015, it's Colfax Avenue, which is operated as the Oakland Motel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For the record, it's correct that a previous speaker said by the name of Jason Mentally Covers Park neighborhood R.A. has now provided support for this project. The current owner, Brian Herbert, wishes to build a boutique hotel. He has informed me and others that he has repeatedly been turned down for financing because the project was deemed too risky'",
        "'speaker_2': 'prior to the onset of the pandemic due to the lack of branding, his own lack of experience in managing a hotel and the project's lack of a universal hotel reservation system as well as the proliferation of short term rentals.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Once the developer realized that his dream of owning a boutique hotel and a changing dynamic of short term rentals was problematic. He decided to defer all maintenance and have his property deemed as white in order to secure tax increment financing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What is trouble is that the so called blight is confined to his property only because of the lack of attention.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To make repairs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That Mr. Torba promised to take care of in 2016. Tax increment financing should not be used to assist a developer with a project that is otherwise not viable due to a lack of business acumen, community need or benefit or market demand within walking distance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'There are many short term rentals. There are over 300. And there are also several ends in bed and breakfast. The site currently accepts temporary housing vouchers from the city county of Denver, Denver Police Department and Mental Health Center of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How do I know this? Because I work with a group of volunteers and service providers who have referred displaced neighbors to the motel. What is the tax increment financing proposal was initiated. The management of the hotel notified residents of their impending evictions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Your vote to affirmative will result in dozens of vulnerable people being displaced. I toured the property recently this month and talked to several people who have been told that they must move no later than July 1st. They have no place to move to and no housing.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Has been.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Identified for them. They state that there was one initial contact about moving from the Alton Motel, and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That is all they have heard since that time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I gave these residents my personal email address so I can follow up with them to get them assistance. The state of the facility on the inside and outside has not been maintained that conditions are absolutely deplorable. However, Mr. Travers management company continues to collect residents from the continues to collect rent from residents living there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I made notes of several Denver code violations of the property that are present today. There are very few motels that accept housing vouchers and even fewer places that accept tenants without identification whose documents may have been lost in a move displacement or suite of assets such as hotel vouchers for city hall immediately.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We're going to go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Move on. That was the time we have allotted for each speaker. Our next speaker is Cathy Price.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. My name is Cathy Price. I live on Monroe Street as well. I am a resident of South City Park, but I'm here to represent and speak on behalf of the City Park Neighborhood Association, for which I am the current Treasurer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I just wanted to address the members of Council to say that I am here on behalf of the City Park Neighborhood Association in support of the redevelopment of the Allan Motel property.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'As proposed by Inspire.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Investment Group. We have performed, we being the Neighborhood Association, have performed several surveys of our membership once in 2019 and again recently in March of 2022. And those survey results have shown overwhelming results and support from our neighbors, from our members of this redevelopment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'In 2019, the membership voted at 9090 5%. I do not have the number that voted at that time, but 95% of members voted in support in March of 2022, after Bryan and Inspire Investment Group came to the South City Park Neighborhood Association meeting to address proposed changes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Provide a presentation along with Dora. In March 2022, we sent out their second survey. That survey was open from March 28 through April 10th, so significant period of time to obtain the opinions of our members. And the results of that showed 88% of the current membership are remain in favor of this project.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So with that being said, again, just showing the support on behalf of the R.A. that the neighborhood or excuse me, that the hotel sits within. Thank you so much for your time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Katie Blakey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, hello, council members. My name is Katie Blakey. I'm also a member of ten and 11 District ten. I send up to speak to ask that you please vote no on this bill. I don't think it's appropriate to use tax increment financing for this project, which provides limited community benefit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The owner purchased the property in foreclosure, understanding how much work the building needed and has allowed the property to fallen into further disrepair in the six years they've owned it. This type of funding mechanism should be reserved for special projects that will deliver a significant.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Benefit to the community.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'According to a report from the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Denver Hotel occupancy rates year to date are averaging about 58%, which is well behind the 74% occupancy rates of 2019. Boutique hotels in particular are risky business. Venture restaurants, cafes and even pools are facing significant staffing shortages.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In light of this, it's inappropriate for the city to take on this additional risk when we're facing increasing costs, inflation and record levels of homelessness and displacement. Also, and listening to the presentation, it sounds like this project will take money away from Denver Public Schools from the deep levy.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you could please clarify what exactly that all means. Like many.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Others who've spoken, I'm concerned about the people.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Who are being displaced from the hotel and wish we lived in the kind of city where that consideration carried a real weight. Thank you for your time and please vote no on 20 20589 and 20 2-0590.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Our next speaker is Christopher Johnston.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes. Good evening, City Council. Thank you so much for this time.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am asking you to vote yes and I am.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Testifying in support of the Borough Proposal for 3015 Colfax. I also live with my wife, young children on the 1400 block of Milwaukee Street. So just across the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'From this property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We need to be taking plywood down from Colfax windows, not putting more up. The request being put forth by Dora will help accelerate the Greektown business district out of the stagnation that COVID created and anchor it for many years to come.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'As has been mentioned, the hotels that this will be modeled after have been extremely successful, whether.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It's in Austin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Washington, D.C.. In my discussion with what local businesses still are present, at least in the Greektown business district from Lake Steele down to York. The excitement and possibilities this project creates are obvious. I won't belabor the points with regards to hospital support, local residents support commercial space that has been.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Mentioned and how.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The growth will help support the tax base for our city. This has been in its state for decades. This is not Brian doing that. It it's in this current state. And I think his proposal has been the only one for a very, very long time that will actually bring back some activation to the Greektown business district in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'this area of Colfax. I know that is being used for small number of housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Vouchers, but I.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Think we shouldn't withhold future municipal support from a business just because they.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Participate in the voucher program. That seems more like a punishment to me.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think voting no will actually disincentivize future voucher enrollment and resources. And as has been presented, there's been extensive work to that. No one will be displaced. It's also been said that the planning board, though, coming forth with no recommendation, was merely because there weren't enough people present to show what was overall a supportive vote in favor'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So yeah, please vote yes to help this area of Colfax. Vote yes for your constituents who want to see Colfax thrive.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And don't let this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Property remain in its blighted state for decades to come. Without your support, this is sure to happen. Thank you so much for your time and for your service.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Appreciate you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 589. Council member.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sawyer thinks that a President Tracy, one of the speakers did bring up a great question that I think is important to clarify for everyone, and that is exactly kind of what tax increment finance financing does in relation to the three taxing entities in the city and county of Denver.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So if I may, Councilwoman, I'd like to both answer that question and maybe give an additional little bit of additional context to maybe clarify some other agreements as well. So so tax increment financing is a mechanism by which only newly created revenues as a result of the redevelopment are made available to Doura.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To help reimburse.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Costs that the developer is incurring. So when the other taxing entities evaluate the project, they have to first decide is the project going to occur? And if so, what would those new revenues be? That again, but for this project wouldn't be there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And then more importantly, what does the project itself do as far as impact their delivery services? So taking Denver Public Schools, this is proposed to be a hotel project. So therefore there are not new residents that are coming in to the school district system that they would need to assist.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so very, very frequently, when it is a commercial only project, that is the viewpoint of DPS. Conversely, when it is a project that has a significant amount of residential or just any residential, they look at that evaluation differently.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'When it comes to urban drainage, this is part of an existing network of of utilities that they participate in. And so they also agree that given the size and scope and scale of this project, it was not going to have an impact.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to circle back to again those revenues that and the and the structure that we are pursuing, which is that the developer has to finance all of the project. He only stands to benefit if the project is successful and therefore actually generates an increase in property taxes as well as sales taxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So there is no risk to the city. This is only capturing those taxes that are generated within the boundaries of the urban renewal area. So it would be any sales tax generated by the project as well as property tax above what is currently being generated.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I hope that helps. Yep. Really appreciate that explanation. Thank you so much for that and just don't go anywhere. One more quick question. Just wanted to also clarify, a number of the speakers had said I had felt very strongly that they did not want this to be an apartment building.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It is going to be a hotel. Is that correct? That is correct. Is going to be a hotel, not an apartment building. Okay. And historically, up until the time when the current owners offered it to the city to use as temporary temporary housing for residents who were at risk to COVID.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Or just temporary housing in general? I may have to defer to the owner on that question in that it is my understanding that there are no city vouchers currently being deployed at the motel. Oh, great. Okay. That clarifies that for me then.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is that correct? Do you want to do you want to come up and respond to that?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Please introduce yourself for the public record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes. Thank you. Brian Tauber, the owner, representative, owner of the property. I believe I heard the question was, was the motel offered as temporary housing during the pandemic? The answer is yes. I did reach out to at the time it was marketed by Denver to say we need some housing help here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I reached out to I think it was Nestor hosted and offered the apartment because we had plenty of rooms available. We interchanged with a couple of emails and they declined respectfully that it just didn't check enough of their boxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Got it. Thank you. Really appreciate that clarification. So what happens if we agree and vote to create this urban renewal area? We agree to allow the financing and the project fails. What? What happens? I hope it doesn't, for your sake.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But what then? This may need to be a tag team answer and I will give the Urban Renewal Authority answer and then Brian put you on the spot as far as what your your answer may be. The risk is borne by the developer.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, again, in putting together this project, he has already put a significant amount of equity into the project and is securing loans that will be serviced in part through the performance of the project just from normal cash flow as well as then by the amount of incremental taxes that the project generates.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If those if the amount of tip is not that that was expected to be generated, isn't there. There just needs to be additional resources brought forward by the developer to continue to to repay the obligation and or take a reduction in the amount of equity returns that they would otherwise be seeking to achieve.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay, great. I hope that doesn't happen, for your sake. If this ends up being approved. But I really want to know what is the city's risk? What are what are we looking at in terms of, you know, if we agree to this, then what comes next?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So really appreciate that explanation. I think that's it for me. Thanks, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sawyer, Councilor Pro-Tem Tem. Thank you, Madam President. A lot of people asked why the city didn't purchase this. Was it offered up? Was there any interest? Was that a play at hand at all?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hmm. So that's a good question. In December of 2015, this proved this property, as well as the other property that was in bankruptcy, went to auction, public auction. I wasn't a participant at that time. We weren't in a situation to pursue it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The stalking horse bidder, they call it, would have been awarded the project. There were no competing bids to purchase it. He was the only one at that time that had even advanced an offer because there wasn't a competing bid.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The trust, the judge of the court said, Well, in exchange for allowing you the 10% discount because nobody bid against you, we have to take it back out to the public market. I was at that case hearing and when that happened, I decided, well, maybe now that it's going to be re offered at a future auction that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'maybe at that point I would be interested to to make an offer for it. April of 2016, four months later, that auction was conducted. There were four individuals or representatives at that particular auction. One was a stalking horse bidder.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One was an individual behind me. I don't know what the intent was. There was a third that declined to bid, and I was the fourth. I believe all of them were individual developer representatives that had an interest in it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I haven't met anybody that was a representative city that had any intent to buy.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay, great. Thank you. Counsel for Tim Torres, Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Council President So this is also a question for I have a few questions for Mr. Tauber, and I'm sorry that I'm not there in person, but hopefully we can figure this out. My being virtual and you in person.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to read a quote from Congress Park resident Vicky Eppler. Brian Tauber. And as partners have invested considerable time and money in an effort to create a project that would fit the context of Colfax and add community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This is not a luxury motel. This is not a chain hotel, but a local business. So that's the end of the quote. We certainly heard in public comment from multiple people who say that this will be a luxury motel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Help me understand if the people in public comment are right or and this letter, by the way, is in granicus. So this is this isn't it's publicly available for anyone to read it. But help me understand either why this is a luxury motel or why Miss Epler believes it is not a luxury motel, but just a local'",
        "'speaker_7': 'business. Somewhere the narrative got put forth that this was a luxury hotel. I'm not quite sure where that came from. It didn't come from anybody that I represent. This this hotel is designed and has been designed to be kind of a community in which it runs.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's probably going to sit somewhere squarely in a three star. It's designed to be an affordable housing or affordable accommodation. It's not something you would see down in Cherry Creek. It's independently owned, independently branded hotel and. Luxury, I guess, means different things to different people.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I guess because it's cleaned up, maybe somebody thought it was luxury, but we're looking to fit within the fabric of the community and of Colfax. And I think that the business and the brand that we've designed is just that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If you're familiar with other types of boutique hotels that are small in nature, they're really they're they're just hotels that kind of speak of the local culture. And that's kind of how we designed it and branded it. So it's not a luxury hotel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's it's really kind of just a understated place where people can kind of come enjoy time, kind of work and relax and have fun. Thank you for that. And the same in the same letter, Ms.. Mentions that she's on the board of Congress park neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But she but that she is writing specifically on her own behalf, not on the board of of CBN. I know that you've given multiple presentations to Congress neighbors. Could you tell me a little bit about your the presentation and the expectations that the Board of Congress party neighbors had for you?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did they do they share that they were intending to take a position or were they inviting you to present so that TBN attendees could be better informed or, you know, help me understand what KPMG's expectations of you were and your expectations as a result of your presentation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So my recollection is two conversations. The first conversation was just with the board members. I gave them a personal tour. Vicki was part of that personal tour. I remember there are five or six individuals. I remember they were all board members and I toured the property with them and explained what what we were doing and it was'",
        "'speaker_7': 'support. It was that we like it. The reason why it wasn't in front of the neighborhood is because we didn't have a meeting that I could fit on their agenda back then. And we were getting ready back in 2000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't know if the year was 2019 or or 2020, but we were getting ready to move forward. That and then the pandemic hit and everything just kind of shut down. We then with Jeff, with with Darragh and myself formally were met with a Congress Park neighborhood association where the neighbors are.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they had. Support of our project. I mean, it wasn't 100% support. Nothing ever really is. But I we left that meeting and I think we felt very confident that we had support. So that was with regard to Congress part or the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. And I guess the determent question is, I don't recall Congress neighbors taking official positions on on a lot of rezonings or in this case I do a presentation. And so, um, but I, but I figured I would ask you specifically what your, what your conversations were in case, you know, CPN had mentioned that it did intend'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to take a position as a result of the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Conversation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With you. An official position on it. If they. So explain in our plans and we took a question in Parliament. So I have one other kind of thought process I'm going to go down. Tell me about the pool you intend to build there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Who gets to visit the pool? And what are your community goals for the pool? Yeah. Great question. We we are trying to model. A successful offering that new Waterloo has had in some of their other hotels, and Austin, where they have pools that are available for the community for day pass.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we felt that this was an opportunity to activate that ground level. We couldn't put the pool up top for cost concerns, but we wanted to activate it. So we thought that it would be a nice benefit for those that would like to take an afternoon and sit around the pool and relax, that this would be a'",
        "'speaker_7': 'offering, an amenity and for the community that they could indeed come and use the pool in addition to the hotel guests via daily passes. It's been done in new water, lose other hotels successfully, South Park as well as El Rey.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know for sure and I'm sure they've got others that they do it at. So we're we're pretty excited about that. I think that there's there are some community pools that I'm aware of, but I think this pool will just be more of an activated opportunity to to come and just relax and hang out and have fun'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Yeah. Thank you for that. The last question that I have is very similar. I think you mentioned it in your in your testimony. You talked about the community space. But like for you to go into little more detail about the there's a community space that you intend to build there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And what are your goals for that community space? Are who do you intend to offer it to, etc.? So through our discussions with community planning and development and Denver Urban Renewal, we felt it very important to offer additional community benefits in addition to the preservation of historic structure.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This was important for community planning and development, and we hadn't had space allocated within the ground level that we could offer. But during those conversations, I identified an area that was actually going to be the laundry facility for the hotel and said perhaps this particular space will reimagine, we'll get rid of it or remove it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'll do it off site or we'll move it to the basement. So community planning development actually really appreciated the negotiation between that and it was understood if you do this, this needs to be a commercially affordable space. So I sat down actually a Bluebird bid and some other stakeholders and I said, What would be something that's missing'",
        "'speaker_7': '? People in the arts were brought up that this would be great for those people that are part of the arts group. There were a couple specific art. Art related businesses or non-profits that that that I actually reached out to and and tried to dialog what would work within a hotel that would be a benefit to both.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would be a use that would make sense but would really be something that a small business or somebody that was looking at displacement of their business could come in and take as a tenant and we would offer that to them as a for.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An affordable commercial space.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we have about 695 square feet on that ground level. We re-engineered some access and access to that space. We sent our architect back to the drawing board to redesign it, and we went back into planning with the city to get that relooked at and permitted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we felt really good about it. We know there's a lot of companies that are at risk of displacement. We're just hoping to do a small part. Q For your for your answers and thank you. Council President. No further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Black.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I have a few questions probably for both of you. Tracy, I'll start with you. I know you answered a lot of questions about what tax increment financing is for. Councilman Sawyer, I just wanted to clarify for some of the people who spoke.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Several people stated that we were somehow taking money away from from the city or taking money away from our ability to help people. We're taking money away from housing. So can you maybe clarify that so people understand again that this this is the incremental benefit and we're not actually taking our city tax dollars.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. I am happy to do that. When an urban renewal plan is approved, that includes tax increment financing. The state law requires that there be a calculation of the amount of taxes that the project is currently generating, both on sales tax as well as property tax referred to very simply as the base amount of taxes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That amount is always first collected and then paid to the city or DPS or urban drainage. So in doing a project, it isn't taking anything away from the city or the other taxing entities from what they already were receiving.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's only the amounts above that base that become the increment that are available to the Urban Renewal Authority to invest in the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that that will also expire. It doesn't go on indefinitely. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the term of that would be the earlier of repayment of the amount that we commit to reimburse the developer or 25 years, whichever comes first.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know I think it was last year we had a number of them expire.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some big ones. Okay. I had a question about the planning board vote. And so only five members were present out of 11.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Correct. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And four were in support and one was not. But they needed five votes because that would have been quorum.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, they as I am reading their their bylaws and I'm going to look for others who may have to to weigh in here, that the the requirement for approval of any item come before them is either a majority of those present or five.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so since they there were only five present, the majority clearly was met, but they needed to get that baseline of five, which is the majority of the total count of the board. Okay. So do that. Right, Andrew.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it's not the planning board voted it down. It's just literally there weren't enough people there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Correct, that the outcome was such that they could not make a recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And then I have a few other questions and I'm just trying to better understand, um, what a lot of our speakers talked about, that we were taking housing away from people. So I just wanted to better understand what that housing is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know in our your presentation of finance and government, we talked you talked about the rent that people were paying and the number of days who were there. So I don't know if you want to answer that or Mr. Tauber, but, um, how many rooms are there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Motel?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There are 54.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And how many people are living there now.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As of today or on an average today? I believe there are somewhere between five and seven. Michelle. Ma'am, the actual number, she's here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And and before you stop accepting new people in March, what was the typical occupancy?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So typically there was, according to my tenant that has been managing it for 19 years around mid twenties and that's what we were expecting about 24 people because we had asked for a rent rule several months before and that was also on the record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In March there were 37, so there was a surprise increase over what we were expecting. Which wasn't consistent with the history of it. But for I would assume I believe that there was another site that closed down voluntarily and they moved in here temporarily.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you weren't normally full. You didn't have those rooms, right? Correct. Okay. And I saw a chart somewhere about how much people were paying. And it was would tell me how much how like a monthly. Yeah. Because a lot of people were saying there long term.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct. Are they paying?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I believe. And another great question for the show. I believe that the individuals were paying the motel tenant an average of 350 or $380 a week. We don't collect any rent. A couple of things that I'll share. When we purchased it, we kept my rent to the operating company the same that was negotiated by the bankruptcy estate'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And I haven't raised it in six years because I thought raising it would only put more burden on their business that would eventually potentially lead to their closing of their business. It was important for me to say, we won't raise your in six years and you're well below market rent to me.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Now their business was their business and they worked with Mental Health Center in Denver and others to collect. Reps for the people that were being placed there. Now, from what I understand, even the rents they were collecting were below market.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think that comes from Michele. I think maybe you can add some color around that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sure. Good evening, City Council members Michelle Coffey, relocation coordinator for the Island Motel. To answer your first question, Councilmember Black. There are eight occupants remaining onsite as of, I would say, 5 p.m. today. So. And I believe one of those is an onsite employee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That works for the Island Motel. On average, the occupants are paying anywhere from $330 to $380 per week. And those are cold. Those rents are calculated and collected on a weekly basis. I can't recall the last question, if you don't mind repeating that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I have more questions. So, um. Do the rooms have kitchens?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They do not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So the rent is maybe around 1400 dollars a month.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Ranging anywhere from 13, 2013, 20 per month, 1400.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And just for some context. So let's just say it's 1300 dollars a month that I just Google the average rent in Denver and it is about 1700 and that's average and those include kitchens. So I would not say that the Orland Motel is a bargain and there's probably, you know, some better places for people that people'",
        "'speaker_4': 'could live. So I'm just trying to put this in context. And you're telling me that typically there's only around 25 rooms that are occupied. But I did have another question for you. So that the the people who you've been helping.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for doing that. They it's my understanding that they are being held or they're declining your assistance. Is that the case or are there some other situations?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So, no, we have not received any declines of our assistance. It's been welcomed the assistance that we've provided. We've also been since March 21st when we issued our general information notices to the occupants. We've maintained on site hours and sweet to I'm sorry room to 15 months with 250 room tip to 15 Monday through Friday from 9'",
        "'speaker_2': 'a.m. until 5:00 pm. And then that effective the first week of June as the occupancy started to decline, we were we've been there maybe 2.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'To 3 weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': '2 to 3 days out of the week. So we've made our presence known with the occupants that are there on site, as well as working alongside of the management team that works for the motel.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. And the eight that you have left, are you competent? Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I would say of the eight we have left, we have four that have applications that are pending and then probably four that we're still trying to complete some sort of assessment to determine their financial I'm sorry, their financial means as well as housing criterias that need to be resolved.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So. And we'll continue on site there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And how.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've met with everyone in an attempt to relocate them all successfully.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. Thank you. Mr. Tauber, I have a question for you. If this does not pass tonight, what what would you do with the property? Would you continue using it as it is being used today?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, the motel's closing. It's just the deferred maintenance. We've just kind of tried to keep it together for as long as we can. We invested in a new elevator so that it wouldn't have to close. We adhered to all the public health criteria for demand to cure and and to fix just so we could keep it open'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and keep it used as housing. But the motel operator just can't make any money anymore. So they asked to move on and they're managing a site down the street for us as well. So that's where they want to move to and focus on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this project just became too expensive for them to keep it going. So if this didn't pass, we would have a boarded up, closed building that we would literally have to go back to the drawing board and figure out what now what?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Thank you very.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Black Councilmember Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. Turban. Just so I'd be sure I understand the. The plan is to renovate the existing building and build the second that's on the side. So what if 57 did you say in the new. In the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Old building? 54 in the old building. 27 in the new.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Now, the current situation, you're renting it simply to individuals or are there agreements with the agencies that these individuals are being referred by? How does your. How would you like to phone a friend?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Can I call a friend? She has more information on the conversation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Again. Michele copy relocation coordinators.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the rooms.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Are there were they were being rented to individuals that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Were.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Some were employed some receiving some government assistance like Social Security benefits. And the only agency that was receiving or placing occupants at the island motel was the mental health center of Denver. And they were paying with. Something that we refer to as a voucher, but it was a weekly payment slip that they had an arrangement with the'",
        "'speaker_2': 'management.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In place.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'At the Island Hotel.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so what percentage of your people would you say came through? And they said we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Had a total of five occupants from MH.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'As of March.'",
        "'speaker_2': '21st.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And to thank you, Michelle, Mr. Tauber, again. So, Jim, sounds it sounds like the building is not in great shape, though, and so have you. You own it six years.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Is that what I remember? Six years. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Give me an idea of how much money you've put in. I mean, have you made any attempts to repair?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. So I personally invested $75,000 on new elevator. The Kims. Their lease agreement is a triple net lease, so they're responsible for 100% of the maintenance and pure triple net. When in 2019, we had a visit from the fire department, the public health department.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I immediately went to them and said, You have an obligation to correct these items. So they invested their own dollars. I was informed that they invested over $100,000 to do all that, but I didn't I didn't check any of their invoices.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they did all the maintenance required by the various agencies that wanted things corrected at their expense. So collectively, I am assuming my 75 plus whatever they've invested just to keep it open somewhere in the neighborhood of $175,000.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Not a lot of dough.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Really for that type of property. I mean, if you want to write me a check for 175, I'll take it. But in the scope of what it sounds like, it doesn't sound like a huge effort was made to bring things up to a higher standard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think from our perspective, we knew that. We only have a finite amount of money and we wanted to. After talking with an, he would deliver on the promise that they had always wanted, which was a renovation of a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Any dollars that would go towards fixing rooms or so many systems that would have to be redone, all the electricity would have to be rewired and the plumbing, they became apparent that it wouldn't be a good use of dollars to try to do all that work when the intent really is to reposition it as something that's more'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of a contributing business to the community. So although we missed a lot, it would take a significant amount of money to bring that up to a level that I would feel comfortable anybody using as permanent housing.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But you did you or the lessee met requirements presented by the city?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. 100%.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, sir. That's all I've got. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think you. Ryan, can you help.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Me clarify a couple of things?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'First of all, what was and is Sage Hospitality's involvement in this project?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have an involvement. They were introduced to me when I purchased it within about a week or two of my purchase to discuss their feeling about a hotel renovation here and whether or not it was a viable project to do such because they're a large hospitality management company in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I sat down with their executives and discussed it, and they do have a relationship and know national groups very well. And it was indicated to me that National Jewish would keep it full, that there was a need for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So their interest and their involvement was a brief two or three conversations. But at the end of the day, they elected not to pursue any additional conversation with me, to have them manage a future hotel because it didn't check enough of their strategic boxes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And help me understand, you've said a couple of times that the hotel was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The community's idea after visioning processes, but this conversation happened two weeks after your purchase.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Within a shorter period of time after your purchase. And you and I had a conversation when I first got in.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Office about where this idea came from. Can you clarify where this hotel idea came from?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The way I understand it, before I owned it, the previous owner had discussed with the community his intent to renovate this into a hotel, and that plan didn't move forward. So when I came on board, those discussions had already occurred.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I sat down with a former councilman and he indicated to me that the community was desired it, that it would be a good benefit and they would love it and it would be a benefit for National Jewish as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I kind of was informed at that time that was the first I had ever heard that a hotel development was kind of of previous conversation with those people that were involved in it. I didn't have any hotel experience.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It wasn't what I had planned to do here. I wasn't comfortable with a hotel. But as a commitment to to him and the city, I felt obligated to investigate it and have conversations and see if it was viable.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it sent me down a three year rabbit hole of a lot of self-reflect and risk and conversation. And that's when the community engagement really started in earnest on my behalf because I was a multifamily and multifamily developer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that was my intent. I was not not not that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But it sounds like the risk has been primarily absorbed by the Kim family. Correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, the risk of operating would be borne by the Kims with regard to liability risk of the hotel, as is the risk of the asset in the event that they can't maintain their business would certainly be borne by me because then I would be in a situation, I would have a vacant building and, you know, trying to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'figure out what next. So, yeah, we share different risk.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You get the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the project doesn't meet your needs as far as what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It needs to generate in profit.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What is the potential that you will sell.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To Sage hospitality?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't have any relationship with Sage. I would say the potential would be zero. If I were to sell it. It would be something that I would want to sell it to a partner. New Honolulu. I don't. I wouldn't.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wouldn't be working with Sage. I don't have a relationship with Sage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what is the likelihood that if the boutique hotel. Traditional format.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Doesn't work, that you would turn it into.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'An extended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Stay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hotel. We're seeing those pop up. Sage Hotel.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sage has one of them in my district that originally started out as a boutique hotel and then turned to extended stay. What's the potential or likelihood that that would happen in this project? And does any of the agreement for TIFF funding.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Prohibit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It from happening?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can't speak to the turf, but I can speak to the what if scenario if our plan doesn't work. In a situation where that were to happen, we'd be we'd be probably talking about a default situation with the lender.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that default would the lender would tear the default by foreclosure. And I would assume they would take the asset and auction it to the highest bidder and they would move in at pennies on the dollar and probably keep the same plan in place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That would be what I would assume would happen.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so when we were.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Asking for clarity earlier.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About luxury hotel versus.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Market hotel market rate, I didn't hear prices.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And sizes of rooms. Can you kind of give us an idea of how big the.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rooms are going to be and what you're going to be charging.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For? Nightly stays at this hotel.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What, 54 of the rooms or 265 square feet and 27 or 335 square feet. Those are the ones in the new building. Those are all double queens and the existing building, those are all single kings, was in the neighborhood of 265 square feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The appraisal of 80 are expectation, which stands for average daily rate came in at about $181 a night on average.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what was the current.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Average daily rate?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the average daily rate as a hospitality term for the average that somebody would pay throughout a year, some nights it might be higher than 181, some nights that might be lower than 181. It's seasonal. And the average for the first year of operations and this appraisal that we had conducted was $181.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'No, I'm actually asking for the current hotel. Motel? What is the current.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Average daily rate?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That I do not know, since I do not manage it. But I will ask Michelle and see if she has that information.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So based on our assessments with the occupants, they were not paying a daily rate. Rather, they were paying a weekly rate. And those weekly rates range from $320 per week to $400.'",
        "'speaker_1': '$400 per week.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that would be about $45, $46 a night.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Versus $181 a night. Okay. That's it for my questions. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 20 2-589. Council members say the Baucus.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We've heard a really divided set of community members almost evenly split down the middle on this project. And we've heard everything from assumptions that people living in poverty get some kind of deal when they're in hotels, when in fact.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is often the most impoverished people who end up paying a premium on things that we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Take for granted because it is cheaper to be in a hotel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Or a motel when you are unable to meet all of the requirements for a lease, when you are unable to show proof of employment. All of those things that typically are required when you engage in a lease are not required in these weekly, monthly.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Daily situations of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Motels and hotels. We've heard confusion about what.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Financing is or is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not, whether there's a loss in the future or a loss currently. But what I think this all boils down.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To is that. When we.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Allow someone to use a. Public financing tool. There should be significant public gain. A pool with a daily pass for some people, 600 square feet or so of a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Community space without a current.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Rate on what that space will cost or who will be in it. A rate jump from approximately $45 a.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Night to $181 a night. It doesn't sound like there's a substantial community benefit at a time like the one we're experiencing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is about a public financing mechanism being used for private profit. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Public private partnerships are always very.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Useful when we're trying to do things like create affordable housing. This is not one of those instances. This is an instance where someone bought a piece of land. Significantly discounted. They did not invest very much. They passed on the burden of ownership to a small.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Business operator who we should be.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thinking, who did commendable work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'House the most vulnerable among us while keeping their business alive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And investing in someone.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Else's asset. Yet they get nothing from this situation. Those are the people who we should have been figuring out how to create a TIFF financing scheme for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But that's not the case here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And we will be creating a public financing mechanism to benefit someone. Personally their bottom.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Line, not our community. It would be great to have a pool. It would be great.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'To have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'A boutique hotel in the neighborhood. But not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On the taxpayer dime, whether it's current taxpayer dollars or future forgone taxpayer dollars.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So tonight I will be a no on this. I don't think it's ready.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think there are still residents who are not housed. We talked about this in committee, and I hope that my colleagues who are concerned about those residents getting housed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Stick to their guns and their commitment from committee. So I will be a no on this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Black.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. I really appreciate, Councilwoman say, the Baucus comments just now and those of our speakers. And I do understand the need for motels. I know that for a lot of our most at risk and residents who have the greatest needs, it's very difficult to lease a traditional apartment.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I do understand that and I know we've lost a lot of those properties in our city and along Colfax. I also understand the people who live in the area and and why they would like to see some improvement in the area.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I do think it's interesting that how much people pay to live in motels and. We all know that they're they're not they're not usually places where a lot of us would want to live, and they're paying quite a lot of money.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are apartments in Denver. There's a lot in my district that cost a lot less than the Allen Motel. And there's coffee you probably know about some of them in far southeast Denver. And so hopefully you can get every single one of those people into a better living situation where they have a kitchen also.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Uh, so of course that is a goal of everyone here. We all want that to happen. This is an interesting example of the city trying to balance multiple goals, housing the desires of a neighborhood, neighborhood safety, community building, addressing blight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But one thing we haven't talked about is the fact that they're preserving an existing building. And so on different nights you might sit here until 11:00 at night and we're talking about preserving buildings, either designate them as a landmark or reusing buildings in another way.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's something that we all think is very, very important not to tear a building down, because in a lot of instances in Denver, buildings have been torn down. And there's some regret for our community because we've torn down buildings we wish we hadn't torn down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I appreciate the fact that you're going to reuse the existing building. It's good for our environment, it's bad for our climate to tear down a building and send it to the landfill. So I think that's something that's very different about this project that we than we usually see.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Adaptive reuse is challenging and expensive, and I consider this as sort of an incentive, as an incentive to reuse the building. I know in a lot of cases it's cheaper for a developer just to tear down and build, you know, a massive apartment building.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I know we've seen that all over the city, including in my district. So I just wanted to bring up that added benefit that I think is very important is the fact that the building would be reused. That's all I have things.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Black. Councilmember Hines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'EU Council President. As many of you know, I lived at 92 Logan in the Uptown neighborhood for 13 years. I would regularly go to City Park or through the City Park neighborhoods and along Colfax as I walk my dog between Uptown and City Park.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I visited this motel and would go by it a lot and also went to the Associated Rock Bar years ago when the bar was still open. It was interesting even back then. Still, it's it's great to see this motel up for consideration today, considering I visited this specific location many times and in previous years before I'",

In many ways, this is definitely in line with the priorities we've heard about and Guidance Council has given to developers.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'nice and lovely. But that to me is just not the legacy of what public financing tools should be focused on. And so in spite of the fact that there was a good process here and that this is substandard housing, I don't romanticize it.'",

I'll be a no, but I respect those who evaluated things differently, and I hope that we can continue to prioritize the use of tests and projects that are delivering the types of housing and the types of long term sustainable housing that our city needs when we're vetting projects.'",

That was, you know, to bring some commercial to that area of the city that didn't that was desperately needed.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It did displace some residents, but they were relocated. The Dora funds were used for that purpose, as they have been for many, many projects. The 38th the Denver Post site near the 41st and Fox project included tax increment financing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's a mixed use project that will include some housing. I could go on and on. The Stapleton had $300 million in tax increment financing, and that did include some affordable housing that was negotiated with the developer to ensure that we were working to include low income residents in that development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the tool and you all know about downtown and how much that was used throughout our downtown for various projects. So I wouldn't say that it solely has to be used for residential projects. Historically, it's been a mixed bag and I think this is an appropriate use.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Oh. Um, Sue Glass, smoker. I live in Curtis Park, and I've been a long term resident there. I'm concerned. I am opposed to this project because I'm concerned more about the character of Curtis Park. We're an unusual neighborhood, surrounded completely by commercial and busy streets.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'How do you do that?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We've seen it go into coal mining, going to coal and such like that. Now it's all right. Why not just gets bigger and bigger? I don't want to be part of that. I know. And because we have such a distinct personality, being the oldest street car neighborhood in Denver, which houses the first park in the game in'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Denver Public Park. So I think that this isn't a bad plan. It's just in the wrong spot and it's coming in to Curtis Park. Our neighborhood plan says that three stories and residential. This does not fit the neighborhood plan and blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know I shouldn't do that group of. I think this is the parcel that needs to be cleaned up, developed and resolved. But I think it needs to do in response to what our surroundings are. And we're not a five storey neighborhood and there's different ways of doing transitions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And that was this was all set up in our neighborhood plan. There was a lot of foresight into that. And apparently it has worked extremely well because we haven't had a lot of rezoning, but we certainly have had a boom of a development, including Curtis Park.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So I want to keep Curtis Park and keep the character and I don't want to lose our edges. And this is just, y'know, eating away at us. It's not about a personality. It's not about the project being good or bad.'",

        "'speaker_3': 'They're fantastic. With more specific focus on the project itself in the Zone. In a previous hearing, you guys were a part of that. A supporter mentioned a 50 minute community, and since COVID 19, we've seen this resurgence and desire for a 15 minute community, which is having accessibility of basic needs within a 15 minute drive.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And 15 minute communities are built on five minute neighborhoods, which is what Ryan was trying to become a five minute neighborhood. Simply put, is making sure that food and necessities are locally available. It's creating green spaces. It's housing people, specifically enough people and a diverse population to frequent and support local businesses.'",

The proposed project checks all these boxes Save the Schooling piece, and schools in the area have spoken support in previous hearings for this project.'",

You know, talking about the streetcar neighborhood, I think the five minute neighborhood concept is trying to bring back sort of the old time concept of local neighborhoods in a new way. And unfortunately, sometimes that comes with higher density, but the benefits of that, I think, greatly outweigh the the offset of traffic and things'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Denver's become a really modern city. A lot of folks, as we all know, want to move here. That provides pressure on affordability, housing, job creation, education. It goes down the list. But what's important is that we're listening to each other and working together.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And I think that's what Tom and Edens has done very thoughtfully in his community meetings, in his outreach. I know that we've shared simple things like trying to get trash cans on the street and rhino, which was a big win for me when I was part of the rhino, our board, and getting crosswalks and stop signs at'",

        "'speaker_1': 'A Lawrence interactive open space through the interior of the project. Substantial parking and the use of a pool to ensure that the development of this particular proposed project has benefits. This brings us to the second point, which is the first item on the rezoning criteria consistency with adopted plans.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I think this is one of the more controversial topics for this particular proposal. It states the proposed official map and then it is consistent with the city's adopted plans for the proposed rezoning is necessary to provide land for a community need that was not anticipated at the time of adoption.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The city's plan. I believe in this case. This proposal meets both of these criteria from the adopted neighborhood plans. Land Use Concept Section. Urban residential neighborhoods are higher density, primarily residential, but may include a noteworthy number of complementary commercial uses in northeast downtown.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Urban residential uses tend to be located in areas that transition from historic residential neighborhoods to more intense mixed use neighborhoods. A mixture of housing types is present, including historic single family houses, townhouses, small multi-family apartments and sometimes mid to high rise residential structures.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Per the map attached to the neighborhood plan, the Lawrence Corridor is identified as an urban residential area, as a as a the second half of the criteria, while the neighborhood plan height guidelines generally call for three stories in this area of the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'For context, the Northeast Neighborhood Plan was adopted in 2011, although not anticipated at the time the plan was adopted. This area has organically evolved into the commercial and retail hub of the neighborhood at the intersection of multimodal transportation, with 26th Street as a designated bikeway, 27th as a designated pedestrian walkway and public transportation.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'A lot of the community feedback clearly spoke to the need this project fills, which was not envisioned five years ago. In addition to the previously stated benefits of the project cited by neighbors, Edens as recently committed to a small business incubator program and artist residency exchange program and even more affordable housing, with at least 10% of units'",

        "'speaker_1': 'Good evening, City Council members my name is Tim Choi, previous owner, family owner with Jose Liquors. I am in support for this change of zoning. I love the development of Edens. We worked closely with them to sell our business and we got to see the plans ahead.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Keith Pryor is our next speaker, followed by John Hayden.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Good morning, counsel. Thank you so much for staying with us. Keith Pryor, Curtis Park, neighbors live on 24th in Tampa in support at this time has been amazing. This project, as we talk about does meet the criteria. And I want to address a couple of different things on one to the conflict between Blueprint Denver and the Northeast'",
        "'speaker_1': 'area plan. So yes, it is called out for three stories, but in that northeast area plan, it does call out for having other community benefits. And this project has significant community benefits, outdoor open space. It is also one of the other pieces that I want to address is the pod.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this project if it were to go straight zoning into today's IMAX CMCs three, five, eight with the new affordable housing, they would be able to get the additional floor height because they are providing the affordable housing component.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But what this Pudi does is it allows for setbacks. And the setbacks are critical because it transitions and it recesses to deal with light issues and how it impacts the adjacent neighborhoods. And also through having the setbacks and through having the Pudi allows it to basically say they're setting a very high bar.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so this is not a precedent setting rezoning. If others along the corridor want to provide the amount of extra care and thought and open space and affordability and workforce housing and setbacks, then yes, I think that that is very worth wanting to see if we want to allow these extra heights along the corridor, given the additional'",
        "'speaker_1': 'community benefits that this project is bringing forth for our community, and why we and why I am supporting it is because it does bring forth all of these additional community benefits which the Northeast Area plan would allow for and does want additional heights because it is bringing these community benefits forward.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We are entering into a community benefit agreement with Edens as a part of this program, and so I encourage you to support this project because not only does it check all the boxes, not only does it do a lot of benefits for Bipoc community, it really goes above and beyond.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so those precedent settings, I would love to see it if they want to bring this on throughout the corridor for all of the community benefits, I would be more supportive. I would love to see this duplicated because it is such a great community and it is really raising the bar for a rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I do support this and I encourage you to as well. Thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'I think.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I could add that hasn't been said already is you're hearing a lot of fear about density and high impact on traffic and tall buildings on the Curtis Park neighborhood. I love Curtis Park dearly, and I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Work every day for that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Neighborhood. And I believe that the transition from the two story neighborhood to a Larimer is really appropriate. It's very gradual. It goes from two stories in the neighborhood, up to three stories across Arapahoe, up to four stories at the far end of Arapahoe, and finally up to Larimer, where it reaches five and seven.'",

        "'speaker_1': 'So I greatly appreciate the support of Tom and Ian's and everything that they're doing and I look forward to these opportunities continue.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To spread into the community.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Rheumatol Thank you. Our next speaker is Nancy James. Do we have Nancy James with us. Okay. It looks like we don't. And so that concludes our speakers this evening. Appreciate all of the community members who signed up and spoke.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22. Dash 476. Councilmember Torres.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'CBD. Just a question for you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'A lot of what we've heard and I was reviewing the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Neighborhood plan was about the the difference between what the neighborhood plan allows and what the permissiveness of Blueprint was. Blueprint is pretty extensive in terms of the Five Points neighborhood and what what additional permission our future places allows.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How much of.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The neighborhood plan does it really kind of deem? Lower intensity than what blueprint will permit. This isn't going to be the only project along an entire stretch. Right, of Larimer Lawrence. That is going to be allowed to to rezone to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Be more intense than it currently is, or then that even the neighborhood plan allowed.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So this map that I just pulled up shows the the the height recommendations from that plan. And you can see there that there are, you know, several kind of a corridor along Larimer, Lawrence and Arapahoe that have recommendations for three stories in the Northeast Downtowns Area Plan or neighborhoods plan.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, you know, this would just rezone this one area is it is possible that another another applicant could propose a similar rezoning. I would note that the the adoption recently of the expanding housing affordability program does all now kind of automatically grant some increased height to other areas of the corridor that already have three and in some'",
        "'speaker_8': 'cases, five story zoning. But yes, so that, you know, this gives you a sense of kind of the area where that plan does have a lower height recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But my my my question, I guess, is that. We're going to see more than likely a lot of utilization of that blueprint permission throughout that corridor without much, I think, pushback from the neighborhood plan. Right. Because Blueprint allows it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, I would say the blueprint, as a couple of the speakers mentioned, the blueprint does highlight the importance of neighborhood plans, but acknowledges that they do evolve over time and and sets forth some some considerations for when we have a conflict like this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And between the blueprint recommendation, that is a more sort of general higher level recommendation that, you know, for uses up to eight storeys in an area like this and you know, other other rezonings would be considered using those same exact the same exact factors as set forth in blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And certainly there are other recommendations in the Northeast Downtowns Neighborhood Plan, Neighborhoods Plan that are furthered by this proposal. You know, the vibrant, walkable streets, a mix of uses in height is one element of the plan. But there are many other elements of the plan that would be furthered by this proposed rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam Chair.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, counsel. Pro tem to us, Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. Thank you, Madam President. Andrew. Is this project coming in under the guidelines of the VHA?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this the affordable.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Housing agreement that has been reached between host and the applicants here is in line with the enhanced requirements of VHA, which, if applied to standard zone districts somewhere, would allow those additional height incentives. However, this was this was developed in advance of that the adoption of that of those code amendments.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and so the I would say that the agreement on affordable housing is certainly modeled after what was being proposed at the time.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So they're but they're not paying the new linkage fees. They're paying our obscenely low previous linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That is a good question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm not sure I can respond specifically to the linkage fee.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There if you have some comments on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Cashman. So just to put some context, the project actually technically would be exempt from the FHA because of the timing requirements.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But because of the.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The timing requirements of the exemptions, the June 30th and the August 30th deadline.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right behavior. However, the applicant felt really strongly that they wanted to provide the enhanced affordability required under the FHA for a high cost market, even though this is a typical house market. So pretending we weren't going to be exempt from the FHA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So to that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'End, as you know, with the FHA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And the enhanced affordability round for retail is actually exempt from paying any linkage fee at all. So in this instance, we are paying the mortgage fee under the old rules for all of the nonresidential uses and we're voluntarily providing that 10% at 60%.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Am I. Does that answer your question?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, so you're paying the old linkage fee on the areas that you do pay linkage fee on?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yes, but we're in the VHA.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We would actually be exempt from paying the ground.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Just.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the ground floor element of it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But that. What percentage of the square feet is your ground floor retail? Any clue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'About 20%. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Any idea how many residential units you plan on building?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Around 380 residential units currently across those two parcels. And how many square feet of commercial? Around 100,000 square feet of commercial uses. Retail uses of the ground.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Effectively the complete ground floor.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Because all the parking is below ground.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. Would you introduce yourself for the public record, please?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Apologies. John McIntyre with probiotics.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Great. Thank you. Council member state of Alaska.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Q Just a question. When we deny our rezoning and it is consistent with the plan, we're often.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Concerned that a developer will sue the city. In this case where you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Have community saying over and over that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's not consistent with the neighborhood plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's not. Do we have any liability?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think I would ask a representative from the city attorney's office to respond to that if possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Wing members of council. Consultancy to back is your question. Are you questioning how we reconcile?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Something like the city because we deny their plan. We're often very worried. But has there ever been a case where a community sues.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The city when we.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Approve something that was not.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Consistent with the neighborhood plan?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No, ma'am. So council has to stick to the criteria. And what I would suggest is that you take all the plans that the city has together, the comprehensive plan blueprint, Denver and the neighborhood plan, and see if you can reconcile those to support what is being requested this evening or this morning.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so if blue print is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The default in this situation, because it's the most general.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the most new. Why are we doing any neighborhood plans? If this is always the default.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, I think the guidance and blueprint Denver is for for there to be small area plans for every neighborhood because. I think and I'll I'll defer to Andrew on this. But we want to. Boil down each neighborhood to what?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'What their specific parts are. So although we we see.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Things on a global picture.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'It'd be nice for each neighborhood to have a very specific plan as to as to as to what that particular neighborhood wants.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The most specific neighborhood level plan in this scenario.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I'll defer to Andrew on that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. I'm sorry. You're asking, what is the most specific neighborhood plan in this particular rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The applicable neighborhood plan is the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And was there ever a proposal for that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Plan to be amended?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I am not aware.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Of of proposals for that plan to be amended.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Got it. Thank you very much. That's it from my questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Madam President. I do have a couple of questions and I'll start with you, Andrew. So actually the first one is not for you, but let me go to the ones that I do have for you. Okay?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let's see. Actually, these are these are for the applicants. So if I can have the applicant come up. Can you tell me if any existing businesses are being displaced as a result of the project? The I no one testified earlier that they were a willing seller, but are there any others that might be displeased that maybe at'",
        "'speaker_2': 'some point you might. I remember somebody mentioning there is the possibility that Texaco financing might be used for the project. Is there any anticipation that any of those funds might be used to pay for any relocation of any businesses?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They're the only businesses that are existing and operating on their property. Now it's the Volunteers of America which will stay in place. And then Joe's Liquors, the liquor store. But the plan there is to incorporate it into an eventual grocery store so that use will stay on the property.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Into the Bowie kitchen, does that stay on site or does it get relocated to a different location?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'The commissary, kitchen and warehouse will be relocated to a different location.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And where? Where will that be?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There is an address. 4915 52nd Avenue in Commerce City.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And that is a much bigger site. Will still serve the same Denver community. I know they probably provide services outside of Denver as well. Andy, see you shaking your head. Yes. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, we researched it with the Volunteers of America as far as their roots and where they're where the people that they're serving live as well as their employees. And it's actually a better location.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And let me ask you about the businesses you've identified. A number of small and minority businesses. Has most of the space already been accounted for with those you've identified, or is there still more yet to be filled with some of the local businesses?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's still more yet to be filled in. So there's an existing two spaces. The commissary kitchen space will provide space for about four local businesses.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that'll be shared among different businesses using that commissary kitchen. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And then the other species will provide that space for about six different businesses. And so there will be a combination of live work units and then existing space as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So how are you identifying those? I'm just curious.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We're working in partnership with Javon Taylor from Green Spaces and putting together a framework that where we'll be able to identify and work through a process to select applicants for businesses to be a part of.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know everybody knows this as five points. This is. Was formerly known as downtown in Curtis Park and historically was a very large Latino population. And I heard a number of speakers come up and talk about their. Involvement in conversations and possibility of of having some businesses on the site, which sound really exciting.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think that's that's going to be good for the neighborhood. But I was just curious if you have Latino businesses that are part of that as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We would love for Latino businesses to be a part of it as well.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. There are some folks that do work in the community that you may or may not be plugged into. Jessica Holguin is one of the folks who may be part of your.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Jessica is helping us with the Commissary Kitchen program, so she's partnering with us. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So she's very connected to a lot of our Latino businesses, which I know we still have a lot of that live in the community, a lot of Latino families. And so I just wanted to raise that as what may bring about greater, you know, long term support for the project and integration with the people in the community'",
        "'speaker_2': '. So we want to raise that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Let you see, there is just a couple more brief ones. So you already talked about the total number of units. Can you speak a little bit about the unit mix? Are you looking to do any family size units in the development?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We haven't determine the final unit this year within the building, but right now we're looking at a mix of studios, one bedrooms and two bedroom.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And do you anticipate having to access low income tax credits to do the housing, the affordable housing onsite?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do not expect to have to access low income.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. And for families that qualify for the 60%, you would take vouchers. Would you take.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That? We should go investigate that. We have not determined that yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. All right. I think that that would be another opportunity to serve some of the folks that are looking for affordable housing. I think those are the only questions I have for now. So thank you, Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Black.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm sorry to keep the conversation going at 110. Andrew, a quick question for you and I know the answer because I'm looking at it, but what year was the northeast downtown area plan done?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was adopted in 2011.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's right. So 2011 was a really long time ago. And that area has changed quite a bit. And one of the criteria for the rezoning is that that there has been a change in circumstance. And so when we are looking at various plans, that is one thing we also consider.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And the area has changed quite a lot since 2011. And I know we talk about area plans a lot and I haven't said this gosh, for years for sure. I haven't said it since COVID. I don't have one area plan in my whole district.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Zero.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not a one. And there's also a great deal of change happening in my district, not like right now, but still a lot of change. And community members desperately want to have yellow area plans in a couple of different areas.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I know that there are needs for updated ones, but when we think about our entire city, we also need to think remember that some kids don't have any. But anyway, I just wanted to make that point about the age of that and that one area is change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That is another thing that we consider when we're reviewing the criteria. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Councilmember Black, we've got councilmembers to back up next, but we're going to go ahead and go to Councilmember Flynn and come back to Councilmember, say, Bacchus, since she'd ask questions. So go ahead, Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Wow.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Madam President. Andrew, I just want to make sure that I clearly understand the height issue, the number of floors under the GMU, 30 under old chapter 59. There is no height limit, but there is floor area ratio limitation that effectively it's a it's a 1 to 1, I think.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Correct, that's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Correct. It has a floor at the CMU 30 zone district has a floor area ratio of one.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yep. Right. So if you had a large enough lot, you could build a really tall pencil. But you. But that's not really practical. Correct. So to develop on this parcel, I'm sorry to develop in this area that has the old chapter 59.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You know, in conformance with the 2011 neighborhood plan, it would have to be resigned as well. But to a three storey. Off the shelf zone. Could it not? And to keep with the three story guidance on Larimer Street.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'To Jim to establish a limit of three stories. Yes, exactly. But I think development could occur under the 30 district. That is three stories tall.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Sure. But it'd be it'd be 1 to 1. That's correct. So I guess my question is now, with the added provisions in the recent in the just adopted expanding housing affordability, how how would the properties that already are zoned for that with the three storey limitation, how how many stories could they add conceivably if they met the'",
        "'speaker_6': 'incentives in VHA?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So properties that currently have three story zoned districts from the Denver zoning code. Yes. Could, if they met the enhanced affordability requirements could have one additional story. So for that, I pulled up the existing zoning map here. There is some five story zoning and and other districts in this area as well where, you know, up to two'",
        "'speaker_8': 'additional stories could be up to seven.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Up to seven. But they're not on Larimer Street right now. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Let's see. I'm looking at there is one developer. There is one area of of existing CM five zoning at 25th and Larimer at the at the northwest or the southwest corner.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I actually have the zoning map up here, too. I see. All right. Thank you. That's all I have.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. And Councilmember CdeBaca, it sounded like you were okay. You didn't have any additional questions, and so just wanted to confirm that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So that's good.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. All right. Thank you. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 476. Council members CdeBaca.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I really just want to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Stressed to my colleagues that we cannot move.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The target over and over for communities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'On some nights, we pass plans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Only because they meet every criteria tonight. We don't have a single.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Shows us on a map that this is consistent.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'With what neighborhoods or even citywide.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Participants in a process have.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Deemed appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is one.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Scenario that sends a flag to community that you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can create an entire process and zone.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And pod when we're trying to move away from parties. If you have enough money to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Own two blocks. That is unfair to everyone else that we put through these processes. There are people who can't even get a fence variance if they don't have someone else on their same block with the height of fence that they're looking to have.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'For us to do this even in a situation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Where we do want to drive development. Without amending the plan is confusing. And so I think that if we are going to say that. If you put all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Of this together, you can extrapolate.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That this might be okay. Then we should make an.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Amendment to the plan, and we should give.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Community members an opportunity to participate in amending.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The plan.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I don't think that this is a bad project. I don't think that going higher on Larmour.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Is a bad idea. But I do.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Think that communities should have a solid static target.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I think that there should be community participation when we diverge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'From multiple plans.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'In this way.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so for tonight, I don't think that this is consistent with any single plan. And so I cannot support that because we cannot send that message to community that we can just pull.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Things out of thin air.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And see if it sticks. It's not.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fair. That's it for my comments.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm not seeing any other folks in the queue for comments, and so I'll go ahead and add my own that. I do highly respect Andrew Webb and his work and the CPD planners who have looked at this and I understand the residents who are in opposition because of the density and because of change in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But this is an impressive project and I don't think on my time in council that during a required public hearing we have had so many members of the public in favor of a project, I mean, person after person after person.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I have to really commend this team for the public outreach and engagement and especially your commitment to specifically bipoc businesses, individuals in the neighborhood. And I really look forward to seeing how this works and how this can possibly be replicated, because I think it's a model that we should really look at.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I will be in support of it this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Dash 476, please.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'CDEBACA No. Hines.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can each I black i. Clark.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Herndon, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Cashman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I swear.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Torres, I. Madam President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the result one day.'",
        "'speaker_5': '11 Eyes.'",
        "'speaker_0': '11 Eyes Council Bill 20 2-476 have passed. I'd like to thank the members of the public and CPD staff for staying with with us this evening. Our pre adjournment announcement on Monday, June 27 Council will hold a courtesy public hearing on Council Bill 20 2-685 amending Chapter 48 of the Revised Municipal Code of the City and County'"
