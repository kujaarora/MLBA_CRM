    "Amendment to City Council Rules of Procedure for Contract and Lease Resolutions. ": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir. I move that council resolution for 61 series of 2015 be placed on the floor for adoption.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved in second hand. Comments. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. For the benefit of my colleagues who don't serve on the committees and for the public, I'm going to give a little background. This is a proposed rule change to our rules of procedure for the Denver City Council.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it's going to sound like inside baseball of the staff meeting that you never want to attend on a monday morning in your own office about procedure and how things work. But trust me, underneath it all are important principles of separation of powers and oversight and transparency.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So there are important principles here. We currently adopt contracts that are above $500,000 by ordinance in the city and county of Denver. An ordinance takes two readings. It happens on a monday night and then it goes for a second reading on the next Monday night meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That process takes the time that it takes two weeks, but it also involves a requirement to publish that ordinance afterwards. There is a proposal on our agenda later, and that is Council Bill 371 that I have also called out from our clerk and recorder, Debra Johnson, that was heavily influenced by our city attorney's office, which proposes us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'changing that, that when we see a contract worth more than a half million dollars, the city council would adopt it in a one reading resolution rather than an ordinance. Their goal is to save money by not having to publish the resolution in a newspaper and print newspaper, believe it or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And also to save the time delay that both the two readings and the publishing takes so that business of the city can move faster, that we can be efficient with your taxpayer dollars. So that proposal came and it has now been heard in committee four times, technology and services, chaired by Councilwoman Ortega Finance Committee.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then we also discussed it at our City Council Operations meeting, which is our staff meeting. So what that conversation entailed was a real interest from members of the committee that I heard speaking out, that they were interested in the efficiencies of trying to save some time and money, but that contracts are one of those animals that'",
        "'speaker_4': 'tend to come to us a little bit last minute in terms of the final language that we often hear concerns from the public or even from sometimes employees who are acting a little bit as whistleblowers at the very last minute.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what happens right now in a two reading system is if I get those questions at 3:00 on a monday, I can ask some questions at the city council meeting, but then I can also spend the next week investigating before the final reading.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I can ask for more data and who's held the contract in the past? Performance rates, things like that. So I can really make sure that I'm comfortable by the time I vote for it. On the second reading, if we get those kind of last minute concerns and we only have one shot, it's much more difficult for us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'as a council to investigate. Right? There's not a lot of time. And I wish we lived in a world where people always knew about things early in the process and could give us weeks of notice that they saw some contract was moving through the system.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And there's a question we should ask, but we know human nature doesn't work that way. Oftentimes it takes something being on that council agenda for the public to really know that it's important. So in the course of this discussion, a compromise.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is my attempt at making a compromise. I am not comfortable getting rid of that two reading system without some counterbalance way to make sure that we can spend the extra time we need to doing due diligence just in case we have to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So this rule change, which is what we'll be voting on first, actually allows a member of council to request a delay of a contract until the next regular meeting one time. So basically it makes it the same time period we have now, which is for, you know, the resolution would be up one night, you would request a'",
        "'speaker_4': 'delay and then it would be heard at the next regularly scheduled council meeting, which is typically one week away except when we have a holiday. So that proposal, I'm calling it out now because I need to know as an individual whether this rule change passes to know how I'm going to vote on that other change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if this rule change passes, I will feel comfortable changing the way we adopt contracts. If this rule change does not pass, I will not be comfortable with having a change to how we approve contracts. So I'm bringing it out now so we can vote on it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We can kind of debate. I'm the two are very connected, so we may end up talking a little bit about the impetus at this time, but the vote will happen later. The actual change in procedure. So with that, I will encourage my colleagues to please vote yes on this rule change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if if there are any questions with with the president's permission, I am happy to answer them. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Connie Katzman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say a couple of words in favor of this. I think the the principal move that we're making here is taking something that we approve hundreds and hundreds of contracts every year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And most of them are completely uncontroversial. And yet we submit each and every one of them to the double scrutiny of a two hearing process. So we can make absolutely sure that we're in agreement with something over which there is no controversy.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So it makes sense that we would be speeding that process up, saving time and money and getting our contracts executed more quickly so that the people's money is on the street and doing what they asked for it to be doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But occasionally there is something very occasionally that needs a little extra scrutiny. And I think this proposition here is allowing us to speed everything up across the board. But if something needs more scrutiny, it's easy for a council person to say, this is one that I think we need to look at a little bit more and so'",
        "'speaker_0': 'be supporting this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, councilman. It in your other comments for 61. I would just made the comment. I absolutely understand the reason for the clerk and recorder bringing forward the changes that she wants to do. And I absolutely understand why council members want to ensure that there's a mechanism in place for them to be able to call it a'",
        "'speaker_2': 'question or even possibly delay the problem, delay the process. The one concern that I have is this is a little bit different than anything that we've done before, is that in our parliamentary procedures, it's a majority rules council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This resolution before us allows one individual, if there's something on the body right here at the chambers to be voted on, one individual can delay the process and grant it is only for one week if there's a holiday or something quirky.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It could be too. But from a philosophical standpoint, I think that that's not something that I am comfortable moving forward with. So I would prefer that there would be another way that we can move forward to meet this goal of making sure that council members have the opportunity to be heard without having this, in my, my opinion'",
        "'speaker_2': ', dynamic shift in our procedure. So that's the only reason I will be voting no. I think there could be a different way to do it. But if council moves forward, we certainly do. Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the comments my colleagues have had before me. I, too, am all about wanting to see efficiency. Those of us who govern during the recession, that's all it was. It was. Where do we cut?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How can we do it faster and less expensive? And there are some things that, you know, we have to stomach and swallow, especially during the recession. Some things that we did not like doing. Not hiring of firefighters. Not hiring police.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not being able to keep library hours up. We're no longer in that. That doesn't mean we got to go back and not be lean anymore. But there's just some areas that I think that it may seem tenuous. It may seem.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Not efficient. But it's we're also in government and these are the people's dollars that that we have and that we are stewards of and all of these contracts. And this is a very huge power that we have when we represent our districts and we make sure that these contracts are fair, that they're just and, you know, very'",
        "'speaker_5': 'few and far between. We have problematic contracts. When you see contracts that come through our desks, hundreds, thousands come through, and only a handful of them probably give us any kind of headache. Right. And I worry about those ones that do give us headaches.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think about being on this dais when I think it was in 2000, seven or eight, not 28, when I was first elected. And this body had decided to increase the threshold at which we would see contracts from the airport come to our desks.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And believe me, even after that, we had problematic contracts, especially at the airport. I think I think both you and I are faces here in the paper. And there was a lot of mudslinging going back and forth over these contracts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But did I think it was the right thing to call in the contract? Absolutely. Did we allow folks to come to the table? Absolutely. But it's because of that. And I want to make sure that we are not in our quest for efficiency, that we are not hurting our transparency, and we are not hurting our opportunity to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'make sure things are looked at with a fine through it, with a fine tooth comb. And I think that's that's why I'm not very comfortable about it when the committee meetings was kind of undecided. I do appreciate my my colleague, Councilwoman Kenney, to my friend who has tried to find this middle ground as this contract, as this'",
        "'speaker_5': 'resolution is right now. I can't support that. I don't think it's good government not trying to err on the side of bureaucracy or slowly ness here. Just want an extra week. That extra week could mean jobs, it could mean opportunities, it could mean community benefits.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It could mean that we stopped a disaster from happening and making more headlines. Right. So in a negative way. So I'm not in favor of it. I'm not very even with the opportunity to have someone.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Call it out.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I just it puts it puts that person in a hard spot. Right. And I think it's it's extra helpful to have it come through to. We have bills come through twice.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you. Councilman Lopez, Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Like Councilman Lopez, I was initially reticent, I mean, going back almost six years when I served on a process committee on speeding up contracts to go this route. Although I have to say, I'm not one of the people who has called out contracts throughout my time on council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And a lot of times when they have been called out, I may not have voted the same way or had the same concerns as my colleagues. But I do believe that with this rule change, which is what we're voting on right now, that we have built in a safeguard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'If a contract is delayed for a week so that one of us, even if it's just one, can get information. I believe while majority rules, minority interests always need information. And when we don't have that information, we should have it.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think we've got a safeguard in there. If this is delayed, it's going to take no longer than the to reading bill. So, Councilman Herndon, I feel like even when we call a bill off of consent, that gives us more time and that can be done by one council member.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think in pursuit of information that a minority position is important, even if it doesn't align directly with it with the position I may have. Secondly, in terms of council's power, which I as I said, like Councilman Lopez, I was really worried about because council fought hard to review contracts in the eighties.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But again.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We have this ability to say, wait a minute, I didn't get enough information. And even when you see them come through on consent, I said to the clerk and recorder, this may mean we pull more contracts off of consent and send them to committee before they ever get to council.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So if there's a problem and you've seen a trend, perhaps at the airport of something that. That you're concerned about. You can say, hey, this one, we better get some more information on even before it gets to the one reading resolution.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'You still don't get enough. You can delay it again. So I think we have the safeguards built in. I did give this a lot of thought. But I think it's all there and I'm comfortable with it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Rob, Gotham City, Tribeca.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just one quick point of information. I did not make this clear. This rule change is written in such a way that it only goes into effect if the later bill passes. So for my colleague, Councilman Lopez, I respect that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Even with the rule change, you can't get there on the later bill. But I would still ask for your vote on this rule change so that it's there if it does pass. But you can be assured that this rule change does not take effect if the later bill fails to pass.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It just it only applies if contracts are ever approved by resolution. It has no effect whatsoever if the later bill fails. So it is it is a possible scenario to vote for the rule change and vote against the procedural ordinance change.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Neville, you back up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And just I want to make sure I have all this straight in my own head. So. Council Bill 371 on introduction on page nine is the bill that would allow City Council to approve contracts with a one reading resolution just by virtue of our procedure handling resolutions before bills on introduction or final consideration'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Councilwoman Conscious Resolution Changing our rules would be amending Council Bill 371 on our ability to approve contracts with a one reading resolution. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wouldn't call it a mending, but impacts. Correct. It does not change the language of that bill. It just it's written in such a way that it goes into effect only if that later bill passes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Got it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman. Ever, Councilman Lopez? You betcha.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I guess part of my question was answered and during that exchange. But Councilwoman Khanna, I definitely understand the scenario for me. Like I said, just to reiterate, it's about. It's about good government. Yes. You want to be efficient, but we also want to have a magnifying glass and everything that we do.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And also, because things aren't equal, contracts are very coveted things in this city. And when you're in, you're in. And not very many people are in, and especially not women and especially not minorities. And there's a lot of folks who are if you let's just say that, you know, it requires some extra eyes on it to ensure'",
        "'speaker_5': 'fairness. And, sure, that these things are better, ensure that the process is right and sure that it was fair. And that's that's where I'm coming with this contracts. One of the main powers of city council is making sure that we are counting all those coins and that coin curse of this coin coin purse of the cities.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I don't want to relinquish any of that as a legislative branch.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. All right. In the comments for 61 c none. Madam secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Can each lemon lopez no Montero.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pass.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Nevett i Ortega I rob i Brooks Brown.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Montero I.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Well, actually this was the rule for 61.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, we're voting on for 61.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The rule first. Can each rule first. Yes, I messed up. I'm sorry. That's supposed to be a yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. Well, correct.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Go ahead. What? We can withdraw your vote.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I got it. This is the first time I had to do it. That's pretty nifty.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. Mr. President. No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary, close. Please call to announce the results.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thanks. Nine eyes one day.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Nine eyes one day for 61 has been adopted. All right, Madam Secretary, you ante up the next one, which should be Bill's introduction. 400. Councilwoman Greenwich. What would you like for us to do with this?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. I really called out 404 oh one is a package and I do not believe I need to put them on the floor for a vote. Just a comment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Go right ahead.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mr. President, these bills are extensions of our. I'm sorry. I'm flipping to them. Of our photo radar contracts. So 400 is for our photo red light program, and 401 is for our speed enforcement program. There is no shortage of interest in photo enforcement in the state of Colorado and among our constituents.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've I've shared these comments previously from the dais. This is an extension of an existing contract. This contract was due to be rebid. And we put that bidding on hold because the legislature was having a debate about whether this would be a possibility for local governments or not.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I do not like some of the terms in our current contract. I do not like the signage that we use to let people know that photo enforcement is occurring. The signs. If our goal is to deter speeding or to deter people from running red lights than our signage, letting folks know that they are under surveillance and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in an enforcement zone should be much more prominent than it is. We should have people we have speech trailers that tell you how fast you are going. And then we have red light cameras that are speed cameras that catch you for going too fast.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But we do not use them together. So what you don't do is drive by and see, oh, I was going 42 in the 35. You don't see it while it's happening, which leads people to not trust the level that they were that they were cited for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I believe we need to have simultaneous education while we're doing enforcement. You should see that you were going 42 at the moment that you are cited for going 42. So those are some of the changes. I think it's critical that we as a city explore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The other concern that I have is how the revenue is used. We have heard concerns about whether this is a revenue generator. I don't believe it is. I believe it's a safety program. But the way that we can demonstrate that to the public is to designate the funds for pedestrian safety.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we have a great need for all kinds of intersection safety improvements in this city. It would be no, it would be not difficult in my mind at all to designate these dollars for those particular uses so the public can see how we are using any money raised through citations specifically for safety.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are the changes that I believe must be made. And I am voting for this extension tonight for the very last time. I will never vote to extend this existing contract with these existing terms again, and I will never vote for another contract or another red light contract that doesn't include changes that involve education and deterrents'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and linking funds for safety. Those are three things that I think are really important. There may be others that we need to consider in light of the, you know, state legislatures interest in this topic. But for me, those are kind of the deal breakers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I will be voting for these tonight. But I wanted to raise the awareness of my colleagues that I think we need to play an active role in the policy discussion regarding how the new contracts are bid and the way that we as a city approach this topic.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We need to be responsive to the feedback we've heard, which is if our goal is deterrence, we need to design the contract with education and deterrence in mind. Right now, they're very difficult to see, and it's more of a surprise that they can't really deter behavior if you don't see it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those are my suggestions for the next contract and I look forward to being hopefully engaged in the RFP process. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. So that was her comment and I see no others for 400 or four one. So if councils are right, we will go to 371 court how about councilmembers Ortega and Kenny now? Councilman Ortega I believe you have it for a purpose of amendment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Kenny, did you have something as well?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'll pass.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So you need it out for.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Absolutely. Councilman Nevitt, will you please put 371 on the floor?'"

    "Contract Approval Process Amendment.": [
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir. Mr. President, I move that council bill 371 series of 2015 be placed on be ordered published.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved in seconding Councilwoman Ortega, your amendment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Mr. President, I move that council bill 371 be amended by inserting that intergovernmental agreement that require council approval or on line one of page two after the words, however, and before the word that. So if I can explain what this is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just. We need a second person.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah, we got the move and we got the second time for comments. Councilman, I take it you're up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what this amendment does is it will continue to keep inter-governmental agreements as to reading ordinances and separated out from the contracts. So although our attorney city attorney's office considers ideas intergovernmental agreement as contracts, this amendment would have IGAs and continue to be reviewed as they are today.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So they will not fall under the language of this particular ordinance. It removes them and keeps them as a two reading ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's awesome. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Any comment on the amendment? Governor Leavitt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, I just we had a long discussion of this in committee or one of the many committees that this was discussed in. And I think this is a worthy addition to the, uh, to the ordinance.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'If you think about it, you know, there's a a zillion contracts that pass across our desk. Most of them are uncontroversial. We've talked about that. The ones that do generate any controversy. And many of those actually are intergovernmental agreements.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We treat them as contracts, but those are the ones that do tend to generate a little bit more scrutiny. So if those are the ones that fall into a different category, it makes sense that we treat them as a different category.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I think Councilwoman Ortega's amendment does just that. And so I'll be supporting that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Levitt. Any other comments on the amendments for 371? Seen none. We're voting on the amendment. Madam Secretary, Raquel.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Comments. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So when this particular ordinance was brought forward to committee that I chair, I had some concerns about. What was being asked of us, basically by taking all contracts from what is now to reading by ordinance to one reading by resolution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I supported the change to the rule and the amendment, but in general I do not support compromising our process. And when this was brought to us, we were told that we would save eight days in the contracting process and about $39,000.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were given different information today that related to staff time when we have people from the different agencies who have to come down here on Monday night when we were dealing with the issue. But technically these are salaried employees, so they're going to get paid the same whether they're here or not here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just think that with Denver being a strong mayor form of government that for city council to change the rules, to not allow ourselves to have the two reading time frame. And I do appreciate the amendment to the rules that Councilwoman Kim each brought forward, because if this does pass, that at least still gives any one'",
        "'speaker_7': 'council member the opportunity to hold it up for a week or to have it go back to committee. But I think in general, the contracting process, which I've had an opportunity to participate in when I was part of the Department of Human Services, where I had to do a number of contracts with service providers.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'First of all, there's no systematic way that every single agency does the contracts the same way in ensuring that as staff changes happen, that the new person that has to do the contract has clarity and understanding on all those procedural steps they have to go through with the vendors to ensure that, you know, what's being done is'",
        "'speaker_7': 'one agency is consistently being done in another agency. And until I see that all of that has been shored up and the shortening of the time frame is is one that, in fact, works for everybody. I'm not willing to support this ordinance change.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just wanted to explain my no vote on the ordinance itself. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Lopez, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I think you've made a point. And the last the last time I spoke about it and the reasons why I to start with Councilman Councilwoman Ortega, I just think this is a power that we have that we've had for a very long time.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it's a very important process. We shouldn't forsake it. There's a reason why it kind of sit for two weeks. And when we've we've actually shined a light on some of these contracts, we had a validity to create some accountability.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's exactly why, again, there's a lot of bills that go through. There's a lot of contracts that go through. These are few and far between, but they are very important and I think we are doing ourselves a disservice and the legislative branch to be voting against our own process here.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Robb.'",

Two points at the time when in the eighties, when council achieved the power of reviewing contracts over $500,000, resolutions were used primarily the way we use proclamations today to take perhaps a legislative position beyond our own powers on a city council to recommend something to the state or federal government, or to commend a'",

        "'speaker_6': 'And as I explained before, I think we have ensured that the power is preserved through the rule change. The second point I would make is Councilman Brown and I served on a committee to try to speed up contracts through the city process.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And the process has been shortened in terms of if everything goes barring human error goes as should go, it's a shorter process before we even do this. But the reason we did that good times or bad times aside, is to get the contracts on the street and create jobs sooner.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So the intent of this overlay, similar to the other one, is to really reflect that 19th century, late 19th century character of the Potter Highlands. This image reflects the the type of homes that you'll find in Potter Highlands, where they're one and a half stories and they have side facing Dormers.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So this overlay would limit the overall height of a flat roof structure to 25 feet. However, that structure would not be subject to the bulk plan. It could go straight up at the site. There's another book playing exception, and that's to allow side facing dormers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are multiple limit limitations within the language, so the side facing dormer would be allowed to pierce that ball playing that it's coming in at an angle from both sides.

        "'speaker_9': ', which allows a 40 foot 500 square feet and 35 feet. So this is a lot of the duplexes, the majority of the duplexes in the neighborhood are found on larger lots. And so it's reflecting that character that exists.'",

        "'speaker_10': 'And that's where a lot of the conflict was happening in Potter Highlands. And so what we've developed here and what you see tonight is really a great stride forward in getting the zoning to match up with Landmark so that those two entities within the city government can actually be working in the same direction instead of at odds'",
        "'speaker_10': 'with one another, as has sometimes occurred in the past. So I think that's really important. And I think you should also note that there are neighbors in Potter Highlands that have gone to great lengths way beyond what our committee could do, looking for what are the patterns that are typical in Potter Highlands.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And the one that I would cite is the size of lots. The duplexes are go on. One of our neighbors spent I don't know how many days, but walked every face block twice looking for the duplexes and then mapping where they were in terms of the width of lots and prove to us because we asked him to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that 75% of the duplexes, historic duplexes in Potter Highlands are on larger lots on a double lot. And so that's that's why you see this in here. We're able to support that with with real data. I think that's about all I need to say here.'",

I was thinking about the duplex piece that Tim addressed, and so I'm glad you addressed it, because I was thinking we talked a lot about how many units you can get on the various width of what during the zoning code update process, as you probably remember.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm thinking about the rest of the city. I don't know, Steve, if you can answer this, but I think it would be pretty common to say that the majority of 50 foot lots are two unit multi-unit. You know, with the flat roof rather than the three unit.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I mean, how did we get to that? And is it something we should be looking at citywide?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You know, I think the the Potter Highlands, the characters, typically, you have this side by side duplexes. Sometimes they're they're stacked. But when you have the side by side, they're often on 50 foot lots throughout Denver. I think the duplex is a result of duplexes and triplexes as a result of our two zoning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The more land you have, the more units you could build. Our two is not just the two unit. And so it's an interesting question, having given a much thought as far as looking at this citywide and getting a sense of, you know, if duplexes are on larger lots, but there are areas of the city where we're encouraging'",
        "'speaker_9': 'more density and we're encouraging, you know, stacking.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah. So let me let me angle the question a little bit differently. I was thinking about that. I was thinking about the cost of housing in Denver right now, the cost of rentals or for sale, and that people are living in smaller and smaller spaces.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I was thinking, should we be doing this? I guess one of the questions I have are a lot of the I mean, are our buildings being scraped over there or are these only vacant lots where we're trying to prevent this happening?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I know it's landmarked, so I don't know how often a building is scraped. Tim, do you I mean, Tim, if you want to take a stab at being scraped.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. How did they get scraped under Landmark? Is it easy?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Potter Highlands is an interesting neighborhood in that portion of our neighborhood in that the development has happened over the last 140 years, and yet the Landmark District only recognizes houses as being historic up through 1943, I believe it is.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so anything newer than that, and there's a fair amount of housing stock that's been built since. Under the R2 zoning.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's not contributor.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We have we have nine contributing what are considered non contributing structures. So there are duplexes and multiple unit terrace kinds of housing built in the fifties and sixties and those are being scraped just as fast as people can get the certificate of Noncommercial Conformance.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Robb. Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Steve, can you come up to the podium? There you are and address Ms.. Broad Rick's concerns?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. So it's actually an interesting question. And Ms.. Browder was not the only one to bring up the topic as we work through the conservation overlay, specifically around shifting from a three or ten foot combines interior to five and five because, you know, there are the structures that exist in the neighborhood that may have that three foot'",
        "'speaker_9': 'on one side. So there is an administrative adjustment process and this is new to the Denver zoning code. It did not exist in the previous code previously. You'd have to go to the board for any adjustment. The administrative adjustment allows for the zoning administrator.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'If there's a finding that it's compatible with the neighborhood, that there is an adjustment that can be made for the 31 to 44. Lots related to the site interior setback. So I can only encourage Ms.. Bruder to submit plans, and we can start that conversation as to how to utilize that administrative adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But that's different than the variance that Mr. was.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Asking for, right? So a variance you'd have to go to the Board of Adjustment and approve a hardship. And the administrative adjustment is takes place administratively through the zoning administrator. And you don't have to go to the Board of adjustment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One more question, Mr. President. This is for Mr. Gold. Come up to the podium, please. Thank you for working on the designation of the Potter Highland Historic District. I lived there for quite some time and enjoyed it very much.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I wanted to I wanted to ask you, at what point did you get involved with this whole process, with the text amendments and the map amendments, especially for Potter Highlands?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, we moved in in 76 and started working on the house right away, and we had no kids then. And then the people that were part of the original association were starting to work on getting it designated. And I believe the year was 87 that it finally happened.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so we got really pulled in with that and in helping going around the neighborhood, talking to people and I can't say at all that we were the ones that did all the work, but we got involved then.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And of course, as I said, working on our own house and everybody was concerned about their own houses at that time. And so then it became very social. And the the neighborhood did a lot of things to support its designation with all kinds of parties.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, and we had.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Tours and stuff like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So that's when we really got involved. And then I dropped out for a while. And then some of my neighbors, in a sense got me involved again recently.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So maybe, maybe between you and Tim, you can answer this for me. But as we were going through this legislative process, Potter Highland did step up in a very vocal way, as was mentioned by by Mr. Burns. Can you just explain one more time publicly?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What was it that escalated this conversation to include Potter Highland.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To be better?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That this is really important because we thought we were going forward and. Then we took another we took another curve because we had not covered Potter Highland.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There were a number of vocal, very vocal neighbors in Potter Highlands who appeared to all of us and really raised the issues. They were they were observing new construction, things were being demolished. And, you know, 40 and 50 year old houses were coming down and being replaced by duplexes or single family houses on tighter lots than was'",
        "'speaker_10': 'typical. And so there was this this fear that somehow the Landmark Preservation Commission wasn't really being responsive to saving Potter Highlands and that something else had to be done. And and at first they thought we were the bad guys and we worked to convince them otherwise and then enlisted their help in figuring out what are the things'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that would would help and would be supportive of what Landmark Commission could be doing and how to how to save Potter Islands. And that's that's really the basis for this overlay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So is it accurate to say that basically some developers were finding loopholes in in the historic district that we had not anticipated?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think that's safe to say. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Monteiro. Captain Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is for Steve. Knowing where to go. Steve. So I guess on all of these, what would be the date that these changes would take effect?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Sure. So assuming well, the Scottish village was passed, that would be effective July 10th if Potter Islands and the following are passed, it's also July 10th. Would it would be effective.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. My next question I'm going to ask you and Tim first to answer this question. So North Denver is a little unique because not every neighborhood in the city of Denver has carriage lots. So I'm curious how if they were looked at any differently for development within the carriage?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Lots. I know we're seeing more and more of them being developed on. And I'd like to know, particularly in the Potter Highlands area, how they were dealt with.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I'm going to defer to Tim but I'll just stay. That cares less. We're not discussed or Tim did not discuss carefulness with me that much. I don't know if Tim you have something to add as to why the overlays do not address scares.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Carriage lots.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you know carriage lots are a have been a quandary forever as many of us know in Potter Highlands the the carriage lots are owned by different individuals, sometimes by the city and then sold by the city to individuals.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And sometimes given away to adjacent property owners.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Sometimes, yes. And so we end up with some unusual lots and different sizes and shapes of lots as a result of all of that. And the zoning code doesn't really get down into the details of the shapes and sizes of lots.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we didn't find a compelling problem to try to solve on the carriage lots. But we do know that we end up seeing almost everything that goes on in carriage lots because there's always some problem to solve. But it seems to take a special case almost with each one.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So Tim, I remember before the 2010 zoning code was changed, there were some changes to the old code that dealt with setbacks and mostly the side setbacks. And I remember asking the question about if somebody's home burned down and your home sits right on the zone lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And this is very common in north Denver with homes that sit on the alleys. Does. The changes that you've made, do they look any differently at a scrape off in a rebuild versus, you know, somebody whose home may have burned down and they've got to replace part of it whether they can build back on the zero zone'",
        "'speaker_7': 'lot or not?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, that's a question I think folks at the city staff would need to answer. That's kind of above my pay grade. I would hope that if my house, which is there a lot line on the side, burns down on a single lot that I could build back to that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But I think I think there being negotiations with with staff on that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Steve, do you have any insights on this one?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I'm looking at Adam Hernandez. He has a code. But I think what you're talking about is involuntary demolition versus volunteer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And we do have standards related to involuntary demolition. I just I'm not sure if it's related to these specific base zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah, I'm just I'm just curious, you know, if somebody can rebuild, if their home were to burn down or a portion of it were to burn down and they wanted to rebuild it back on that zero lot line if any of these changes prohibit that or or not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the proposed language for the overlays has no impact on the existing language in the code related to involuntary or voluntary demolition.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. That's okay. Okay. That's helpful. But it would be good to know just the general answer to the question about whether someone could build on the zero light line.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I think we're going to we're going to think we're going to get get back to counseling.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I think what he's doing that the only other thing I wanted to know was whether or not there was any survey looking at. Maybe the number of carriage lots that have not yet been built upon. Where there's potential for more development activity on lease.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So again, the carriage lots were not discussed much as part of the overlays. And so as part of this particular assignment, no, we did not do any sort of survey tied to the carriage lots.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the regular code would apply to any development that happens within those? That's correct.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The based on district still applies.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. And I see Adam came over with the zoning code book, so I don't know if he has an answer to that question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, they're looking that up. Did you have another question? That was right, Councilman. Never did you want to ask a question? And we'll make sure we come back to get Councilman Ortega's question answered.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. I think my question would be pretty oh, no, it won't be brief, because Natalie is playing around with Hernandez. So it was for Mr. and Ali.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'll go ahead and ask and.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't want to hold you up there or it may just take a second. I just wanted to close the loop on the broader question. Looks like you've been caught doing something. The the Mary Broderick question. So did you get where she was coming from and where the I mean, it's impressive that everyone here is in support'",
        "'speaker_0': 'of this and it makes perfect sense. But clearly the shoe pinches on her even though she's supportive of the overall enterprise. Did you understand how the shoe pinches and that her that pinch can be relieved with some administrative adjustment?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That's correct. And and it's in 12, four or five of the Denver zoning code. And it's okay to administrative adjustments. For her particular issue, she was not the only one to bring it up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you. I feel reassured.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And Steve, did you have an answer for or are we still searching?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we're still searching, but I think it's related to non-conforming structures through involuntary burns down then and it's non-conforming then. And if you're in certain commercial zone districts, I believe you can build it back as it was. But again, I'd like to look at the code to give you a specific answer.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the changes that were made before 2010, the citywide zoning code, allowed somebody to rebuild on the zero lot line. But I don't know if the 2010 code made the made changes to that. And that's what I'm trying to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I'm sorry if I could just have some time with the code. I can give you the answer. I will say that the proposed overlays did not change any language associated with involuntary or.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We don't need to hold this up. It would be helpful to get the answer to the question even after we vote on this, because actually that answer isn't going to change anything with this particular overlay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Right. Any other questions on 319 as amended or re 21 scene none. Public area is now closed. Time for comments. Councilman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I want to thank all of the neighbors that have come out to testify to Bill 319 and 321 as it relates to the Potter Highland Historic District. For many of us that live in northwest Denver, we've always wanted to protect and embrace Potter Highland.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Even during times when it was distressed, people were working very hard and could see the the diamond in the rough. And so when this came up and people were very vocal and feeling like, if we're going to go forward with all of these changes in Highland, I was so happy that Potter Highland Historic District raised a fuss'",
        "'speaker_7': 'so that we could bring this forward. It is it is a historic district and it's very, very beautiful. It's got lots of queen ends and there's still some flagstone sidewalks left. And wanting to protect it is what I want to do as well.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the biggest thing is that it seems like there's a baby boom going on in Highland. And we want to be able to keep families in Highland and especially in Potter Highland historic district. And that's being able to enrich the neighborhood and allow for people to grow families.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And your good example, Mr. Goal, live for kids that you raised and now they're off and maybe they'll come back to the neighborhood. But it's well worth protecting and it's well worth being able to bring this forward as a legislative sponsor so that we can begin to direct things so that they are in character with what people'",
        "'speaker_7': 'want in the neighborhood. So I'm very supportive and I encourage my colleagues to support me as well. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. In the comments 319 as amended or on 321, which we will vote on after 319 as amended, seen none. Madam Secretary, roll call 319 as amended.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Kathryn Lopez. Thank you, Madam Secretary, please, because it only announced the results tonight. SheKnows 321 has been placed on final consideration and does pass. All right. Our third combined publication is going to be on Council Bill 322 as amended and 323.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman, Councilman, will you please put the council bill 322 on the floor?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes, sir, Mr. President. And I am doing this correctly, right? Just putting the one bill on the floor and then we're just having the combined public hearing. Yes. Okay. I move that council bill 322 as amended, be placed on series of 2015, be placed on final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. It has been moved and seconded. The combined public hearing for Council Bill 322 as amended and 323 is open. Speakers may address either or both bills. Council will vote separately on each bill at the conclusion of the public hearing.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'May we have staff report?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Stephen Ali with committee planning and Development. This is the East Side interior design overlay is both both a text amendment and a map amendment. Again, the the purpose of this text map amendment is to reflect and reinforce the narrow side interior setbacks found in the late 19th century neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Specifically, Highland, was the impetus for this overlay. There are a number of areas throughout Denver that have specifically residential areas that were developed in the late 19th century that have fairly narrow side interior setbacks. In some cases, the eaves are touching, but the intent is to acknowledge and reinforce that character with this design overlay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the same process and I should also mention that Councilwoman Judy Montero initiated this proposed text and map amendment as well. Public notification for the April 29 planning board hearing was emailed to all Arnaud's and all city councilmembers, and signs were posted for the related Map amendment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then public notification for City Council tonight was emailed to all our knows and signs were posted throughout the neighborhood as well. So the text amendment creating video for this is a very simple, straightforward design overlay for primary building form standards.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'This three foot side interior setback for zone lots greater than 30 feet and up to 40 feet. And what is allowed today and we kind of talked about this in the previous discussion about a three foot or ten foot combined, four zone lots, 30 feet and up to 40 feet.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And what this would allow a three foot minimum sized interior, six foot combined for detached accessory dwelling unit standards. There's a zero foot minimum side to your step back, where today there's a five foot so interior setback. So this is acknowledging the narrower side interior setbacks that exist in this area.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. The review criteria for a design overlay is the it is a text amendment. So consistency was adopted plans in furthering public health safety and well for the general public health safety and general welfare. And that the text meant results and regulations that are uniform within each zone district.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So three plans apply to the Text Amendment Plan 2000 text. The proposed text is consistent with many confident twin goals, including encouraging quality infill development that is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. Proposed text amendment is consistent with many blueprint Denver strategies, including a single family and single family duplex concept, land use and.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'The Sixth Amendment furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of Denver residents as it provides for context sensitive and character reinforcing standards that further stabilize the neighborhood.

        "'speaker_10': 'This is becoming a habit again. Timbers 2558 West 32nd Avenue process. You've heard that one already, so we won't go there again. You know, the real purpose behind this design overlay is to make sure that new construction and additions fit better into the historic development patterns.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And while many of our neighbors would love us to somehow get zoning to deal with the design of the architecture of the houses, we all recognize that's not the case. But we do think that having structures that fit into the patterns of our neighborhood are really important.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so that's where where this is going. We've we saw quite a few examples as we studied these parts of the neighborhood where somebody might have a house sitting close to one property line or right on the property line and want to expand to the side.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But they were being penalized under the current zoning where they'd have to have at least a seven foot setback on the on the flip side. And so in this tighter, tighter area of the neighborhood on lots between 30 and 40 feet in width, it's really important to bring that three minimum ten total down to three and three'",
        "'speaker_10': 'so that reasonable development can happen that fits into the pattern of the neighborhood. And then the accessory dwelling units of having setbacks there that are consistent with garages and other secondary buildings make sense here like it does in the rest of our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those are the the basic pieces of this one. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Okay, Captain. That concludes our speakers. Any questions? 322 as a minute or 323 Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'My question has to do with this is probably for the city attorney whether or not the pending doctrine ordinance applies. So while this was moving through the process, if we had developments coming through and then what I'm thinking about is the United Way building, for example, if the pending doctrine ordinance applies and these rules.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Affect that development or any others that are going into the area. Can you speak to that, Adam?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Adam Hernandez, Assistant City Attorney with Municipal Operations. I am not sure if the pending ordnance doctrine would apply, but I believe if an application is currently in with the city, that the city would be processing that under the code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That was at the time of application. And I would also.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Defer to Steve on that as well.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the interesting thing about this amendment in particular is that actually it's more generous than the underlying zone district. So in all likelihood, if plans were submitted, which I'm not aware of, any where a conflict would be created, but in all likelihood of plans were submitted, then they would meet the underlying zone decision because it is a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'minimum set back. You can set your building back more than what is required by the overlay. So again, it is more generous, not more restrictive, and therefore there should not be any problems with this new language.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So, Steve, will you pull up the map that shows the boundaries of this area? I was just looking at this a minute ago, and these computers do funny things, but if you can pull that up. What I am trying to figure out is how the view corridor from Hirshhorn Park applies to anything down on the eastern edge'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of the neighborhood that's within the boundaries. Does that in any way, shape or form impact heights or anything along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'About that park?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'No, isn't there is no impact. I mean, again, the the the change to the under the playing zone district is only related to and to your set back. There's nothing about height and it's only applicable to the properties that are shaded in blue.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think the park that you're referencing is it's actually it's low, high and five and the overlay would not apply to that area anyways.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. All right. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Ortega. Any questions? 322 or 323. Councilman Robert.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I was just looking up in the zoning code and couldn't find it and can't remember. Do we have a minimum square footage for. For how much land has to be zoned or requirements for contiguous ness?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There is a requirement for a minimum area. I believe it's two acres for for conservation overlays and design overlays. You know, I have to defer to the attorney about the fact that this is a legislative rezoning, and some of those rules do not always apply.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, I'm confident that each overlay is over two acres of land and would meet that threshold.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Well, yeah, I guess my question is on page two of the staff report for this, where they show the map to the very south. There's a smaller piece and I don't know if that's considered. It's not contiguous. And so I'm not I don't know if that's considered its own zone district or part of this overlay zone district'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. That's a good question. It's not contiguous to the other parts of the map, but it is part of the effort where it all adds up to greater than two acres. I think that's an interpretation from our attorney.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'However, this is a legislative amendment, and I think that those rules do not apply.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'A weak link of break rules with the citizens can break.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You can break rules. So.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Good.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I was waiting to hear if we have any requirements for contiguous snus or if Steve knows whether that southernmost piece of the rezoning that's not contiguous is greater than two acres.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's going to be close. I did not calculate that specific area counting right of way. And you know, because the zoning does go to the center line, I would have to go back to calculate, but it would be close for sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So do we have any requirements anymore for contiguous snus? I guess the billboard over, you know, the historic preservation overlay is not contiguous to that. No. It was all old earth rezoning.'",

        "'speaker_9': 'So the community partners associated with, with this effort, the National Western Center partners include CSU, the National Western Stock Show, the City of Denver, History, Colorado, and the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. In addition to community partners, including the dedicated members of the National Western Center Citizens Advisory Committee, this text amendment was initiated by Brad Buchannan'",
        "'speaker_9': ', Executive Director of Community Planning and Development, and Kelly, lead executive director of North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative. Quite a bit of public process for writing. The text amendment started with the adoption of the Globeville Neighborhood Plan on December 1st, which recommends the build out of the National Western Center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And a lot of the recommendations from the Globeville Neighborhood Plan rely on the implementation of the National Western Center itself. So from January to March of 2015, there were preliminary discussions about zoning and the best approach to implementing the master plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And on February 23rd of this year, the Elyria Swansea Neighborhoods Plan was adopted by City Council, another planning document that recommends the build out of the National Western Center on March 9th. The National Western Center Master Plan was adopted by you all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And so there has been a lot of planning, a lot of thinking into the future of the National Western Center. And reading the zoning is one of many steps to implement all of the planning that is taking place from March sorry, on February 28th of 2015.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Over there, CPD presented a summary of the text amendment to agency zoning and planning. On March 5th through April 16th, we had an intense set of meetings and intensive, if you will, a number of meetings in a short amount of time.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Actually seven. We met seven times with the CAC or the National Western Center Citizens Advisory Committee to discuss all aspects of both the text and the MAP Amendment. On March 30th, the draft was posted to the CPD website.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The draft of the proposed text in the map was also emailed to all Arnaud's on the 14th of April, Public Notification for Planning Board was emailed to Arnaud's and all city council members and signs were posted for the related map amendments.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On the 29th of April, we attended Planning Board. There was a unanimous vote for approval with one condition. Then I'll discuss the following slide. On the 13th of May, went to Neighborhoods and Planning Committee. 1st of June was first Reading City Council.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'On June 8th, City Council postponed a public hearing and proposed on the proposed amendment to July six, which is tonight. And on the 11th of June, public notification for City Council Public Hearing was emailed to all Arnaud's and all the City Council members and signs were updated that we're located throughout the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're here tonight for the public hearing. So on the April 29th Planning Board, it was a unanimous vote of recommending approval 1010 oh with the following condition. But the City Council acknowledges and addresses the concerns expressed by the neighborhood stakeholders with regards to neighborhood involvement and governance and community equity.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the national in our entitlement process, you know, there's a lot there are a lot of things that need to take place to implement the plans that we've written. It started with the plan, the vision. We start to drill down in precision and we're writing the crossing, the text and the map amendment.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Next steps along this regulatory path will be writing a Public Realm study that discusses the parks and plazas and open spaces throughout the proposed campus for a National Western Center complex also design standards and guidelines that will scope the buildings and speak to what the building should look like and how they should be designed will then move'",
        "'speaker_9': 'into more precision, which would be site planning and where we get the engineers involved and we make sure that we're we're meeting our life and safety and really designing these buildings inside and out and then we're building. So we've got quite a bit to do between now and then.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And this is just this is just a small taste of all the things that are going on and how we can address that. So the proposed tax amendment, the components of his own desires. We're writing a brand new zone district for the Denver zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we have to determine the context, the zone district standards, which include the building form standards, the uses and minimum parking, and then the general design standards related to landscaping and signage. So starting with the context. So in Division 9.2, you will find the campus context and this is the cover page of the campus context that the'",
        "'speaker_9': 'context or the campus zone districts that exist in the code today would be SAE, MPH, which is the health care campus of Denver. Health is mapped to page. You have CPI, which is the campus education institution. So the Arara campus has the CPI.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then there's the campus entertainment P.A. Gardens, and currently the Coliseum is maps to you. But none of these existing zoned districts will achieve all of the program, all the uses and the vision identified for the National Restaurant Centers.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'We're writing a new zone district, and the campus is a really nice fit as far as the context where you have a large contiguous piece of land, where you have similar wayfinding and a number of uses allowed, and building heights that are where you can get to your highest height in the middle of the site and transition'",
        "'speaker_9': 'at the edges. So campus is the context in where the zone district will have the building form standards similar to those found in other campus zone districts. The max height is 150 feet, with a transition down to the surrounding neighborhoods of transitioning that height down to Brayton Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There are protected district transitions should they be needed, which are built into all of our zoning districts. There's a small setback required which introduces the need for some landscaping. If there is a zero foot setback, that there wouldn't be the requirement for landscaping around the structures.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then this specific building design will be controlled by design standards and guidelines, and that is not part of the zoning. So we are just kind of creating the box to work with in. The exciting part of the allowed uses include agricultural activities, cultural research and educational uses.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Entertainment, civic, public and institutional uses, recreation, residential, commercial, and uses associated with meeting the energy goals of net zero waste energy and water. So the general design standards related to landscaping is required as part of the Basin District.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Additional landscaping standards will be created in subsequent public realm and design centers and guidelines. The zoning is mostly written for the actual structures and the uses, and those plazas and open spaces that are envisioned will be controlled by those public realm and design centers of guidelines.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Signage. The sign centers are consistent with other campus zoned districts, specifically S.P.A.. The National Assessment Center Master Plan does contemplate a revenue stream from signage and being innovative with designs, and so there will likely need to be some amendment to the zone district or some other standards written for signage.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'As this builds out and we locate the buildings and we know exactly where the signs should go and the type of flashing or flashing. And then screening is also found in general design standards. There's a high level of screening required, and it's similar to what was found in other mixed use zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So criteria criteria for review for a text amendment consistency was adopted plans and furthers the public health safety in general welfare and results in regulations that are uniform within each zone district. There are five plans that apply to the site, starting with comp plan 2000.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The proposed text amendment is consistent with many objectives and strategies found in competent 2000, as detailed in the staff report, but also highlighted below. It's promoting in-fill development, designing mixed use communities, reducing sprawl so that residents can live, work and play within their own neighborhoods, and creating more density at transit nodes, enhancing existing focal points in neighborhoods'",
        "'speaker_9': ', and encouraging the development of such focal points to the text amendment in the standards on the text movement are consistent with these goals. From Comp Plan shifting to Blueprint Denver The proposed text amendment is consistent with many objectives and strategies, and I went to greater detail on my staff report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The land use concept is entertainment culture exhibition and is an area of change. We would like to funnel and channel the growth envisioned by the master plan, the global neighborhood plan. The proposed amendment is consistent with many objectives and strategies found within that plan, as detailed in the staff report.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'A number of strategies rely on the build out of the national western, such as embracing the South Platte River and providing better access to community resources, which is a number of community resource uses would be allowed by the base or by the text amendment improving educational opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So the CFP in NWC allows education for all ages, and then also in introducing new multimodal connections over the river to the National Western Center. So is critical and a critical implementation element for the Globeville Neighborhood Plan and the proposed phasing in the build out of National Western Center would start to implement those plans and the Text'",
        "'speaker_9': 'and Map Amendment is one of many fronts for implementing the National Western Center. Shifting to early response to the neighborhood plan, the proposed text amendment is consistent with many objectives and strategies found in earlier in Swansea Neighborhood Plan, as detailed in the staff report but also highlighted here, the allowed building heights should accommodate redevelopment of the National'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Western Center, the text amendment and proposed copy NWC allows of 250 feet, which would accommodate the large structures necessary for this future campus and complex. The plan also recommends encouraging development of key sites, including the National Western Center.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Text Amendment and mapping the zoning will allow for the build out of the National Western Center and then targeting TOD opportunities adjacent to the station. The list of uses allowed by the zone district are similar to those found in zone districts that are mapped near transit stations.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And then the National Western Center Master Plan Prose Text Amendment is consist of many objectives and strategies found in that plan as it recommends providing a variety of programs. This is a long list of uses allowed by the Zone District to foster regeneration, and these are the goals related to energy waste water.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the Zone District allows many of those uses and to drive new tourism and the building forms allow for larger structures or large events could be held where we can drive that new tourism that's envisioned by the plan.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'The Texas move furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of Denver residents as they provide for implementation and revitalization of the National Western Center as identified in the city's adopted plans. And this tax amendment will result in uniform regulations applicable to all new buildings within land mapped copy in WC.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So with that, CPD recommends approval based on finding that criteria have been met. Related to the text amendment. So I'd like to turn it over to Kelly, if you don't mind, just to just to kick us off.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks, Steve. Kelly, LEED, executive director of the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative in the National Western, is one of our six portfolio projects that are going to help reconnect and reenergize these neighborhoods. And I just had a couple of quick comments and I'll be very brief.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One is Steve mentioned this really is this is a milestone for this project. Think about where we were four years ago when you were talking about the national western leaving our city. We've come a long ways from that time and all of you have been really important partners in the conversations to get to where we are today'",
        "'speaker_10': '. You have all we've sat and how many community meetings and one on one meetings and group meetings talking about how we transform the site, make sure the stock shows here for the next ten years. And most importantly, think about how these neighborhoods, Globeville to the west, Larry Swans here to the east.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah. Are transformed and brought along and really benefit from this project. So this is the next step. You know, this takes the master plan and the zoning puts in motion our ability to fulfill the vision, you know, especially with our partners, the issue and do some of the amazing things that CSU is going to be able to'",
        "'speaker_10': 'do on this campus. So that's one, too, is this this is important because it really solidifies the importance of our collaboration with our neighborhood partners. And we have many members from our community advisory committee here tonight that you're going to hear from, and they have been instrumental in helping us also get here tonight with the zoning and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'countless hours spent by by folks that have day jobs and have other things to do. Betty cram selling Avon and being a partner and Dru having a full time job as an architect and John's RPN and many, many folks are here tonight to speak on behalf of this.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But, you know, this project's success is driven by the success of the adjoining neighborhoods as well. So the zoning that you're going to vote on tonight is as much about the neighborhoods and making sure they benefit as well from what we're about to do as we move into more specific.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that's all I wanted to say and I just thank you all for your commitment to this effort, to these neighborhoods and to the journey we're on to make the National Western Center one of the foremost kind of places where we're going to solve some of the biggest rural, biggest food issues on the planet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you both. All right. We have two people signed up, first person and Elizabeth and the second person, David Slutsky.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, members of the Council for this opportunity to speak. I wanted to reinforce this is a good segway from what Kelly was saying, the wonderful process of creating a text amendment through this collaboration with members of the neighborhood, and that this is something that will strengthen by example the type of conversations that are so critical to'",
        "'speaker_11': 'all of Denver, and that this is part of where, as we're hearing people talk more and more, we find the heart and soul of what's going on in the city is first there is the word in a sense.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And in this room there are at least five people from the neighborhood, including Elyria, Swanton, Globeville, that participated as in the breakout sessions with the National Western Center Advisory Committee. There are a couple developers that worked in the process one from Globeville, one from Elyria.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There's an executive from the National Western Stock Show. There's the city council members that have been loyal to the process.

        "'speaker_11': 'the discussions, it's helpful. So as we go forward with our new city council too, I hope that they will see that as part of their legacy is the broad conversations, because we have many conversations to have within the national western centered campus in development.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But I just wanted to say a very positive put a very positive spotlight on the process that brought us to this in parallel to what the actual arrival of the text amendment, the text, the new the new zoning change that that we have.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'You know, this is about the national western that started here back in the early 1900s. And as today, I got to look at this like, oh, you know what they've given us? You know, back when they started, there was nothing in Denver and there was nothing in Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had a couple of smelters. But as time went on, by the late forties, all through the seventies, you know, the national western got so big with the stockyards and everything, they started up, they opened up a lot of slaughterhouses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We became the beef capital of the United States, and it originated out of the national western. There was a lot of byproducts off off of that. Also, number one was fertilizer, you know, I mean, we were shipped it all over the country.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, every steak that was eaten in New York, Chicago back then, it came out of Colorado. And another thing that came out of the natural western and out of all these industries was hides. You know, they processed hides, but they had a trade back after World War Two.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They couldn't process in the United States anymore. So they had a ship em out of the country and that shipped the finished product back here and it would make whatever. So for a lot of years, you know, they came out of Denver, out of Globeville, that originated out of the national western and created a lot of jobs'",
        "'speaker_8': ', you know, a lot of work. And. You know, and I remember. As a little boy sitting up. We couldn't wait to get over the stockyards in the summertime. And you sit and listen to the auctioneer and they would auction off the cattle and the sheep and the hawks.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And where we connected, we didn't feel like we were a neighbor to the national west and we felt like we were a partner because all of that product, all them animals, came over what was called a cattle bridge down into Globeville, and they separated off into different packing houses.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, that was really interesting in in the in the national western the sixties to me, that was before the convention center. And we got to see every venue that came through car shows, you name it. It was it was in Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We had the Denver Spurs, a hockey team, and at the same time, we had ice skating at the at the National Western. We us kids had a hockey teams, you know. So I mean, it was it was the National Western has given us so much.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, and it can go on and on and on. And, you know, we need this zoning and then we come to the zoning. In as hard as Kelly and Steve and Paul and everybody's worked and they're putting it in place, but they put in place no marijuana.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And that's great because when we start looking at the zoning and something got brought to my attention last week, you know, this marijuana industry. They're supposed to let all the dispensaries. I think the grow houses, too, are supposed to let all the neighborhood organizations know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they've never, ever contacted our organization. Now. I owned I owned a bar at one time and I had to jump through a lot of hoops to get my license. And we need to start enforcing that here. There's no enforcement in Globeville, and we need that if we want to shine with the national Western, if we want'",
        "'speaker_8': 'to prosper, if this National Western Events Center is going to prosper, we have to do a lot of enforcement and accountability, and we have to clean up our neighborhood. And we need to see what the city needs for us to do.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And they need to help us enforce rules and regulations. Because you don't. I don't I can't understand how $1,000,000,000 event center could be right next to, you know, a ghetto where they still pollute the river. And, you know, your children and your grandchildren, your nephews and nieces will come to this event center and walk off a block'",
        "'speaker_8': 'away and wind up in a dangerous neighborhood. You know, there's just no future in it, you know? And, you know, we need we need we need to work together. And we are working with the National Western. And I've asked them a couple of times what would they like us to do?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And our response. But, you know, we're asking the city, what do you want us to do in Globeville? How can we better serve the national Western? How can we make this the best it can be? Because this this national western, this event center is going to.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Benefit all of us for years to come, and we want to be part of it. You know what? The other thing we need to do? We need to limit the size of these grow houses. You know, if we don't stop it, we're not going to be able to bring in new development.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You know, and and I can't understand why there wasn't regulation like the liquor industry. You know. And nobody partitioned our neighborhood ever. Anyway, that's all I got. And I want to thank you, folks. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. Lansky.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. That concludes our speakers. Do we have any questions on 324 as amended? Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just have a couple of questions. And let me ask Steve Nelly first, if you would come forward, Kelly, you might want to sit in the front as well. Steve, you walk through some of the additional documents or press procedures that still need to take place.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You talked about the public realm, study design standards and guidelines, site planning, and then construction would be kind of the final. So I know when you and I met last week, you talked about a development agreement. Where does that fall into the process?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Or the big picture of all of this that we're dealing with?'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah, I think the conversation that we were having was about, you know, things that aren't necessarily in the zone or are necessarily appropriate for the zoning and what other tools may be available. There are a lot of tools available, one of which could be a development agreement with between the city and between the future governing structure.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That was my you know, it was one suggestion of a tool that could be used for things that aren't necessarily in the zoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. One of the questions I have about the height issue and we talked about this when we met last week is that. The height is just sort of overall for the site, the height limitations and. This is a 15 year buildout or so of the site.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I'm just trying to understand why the 15 feet sort of applies across the board. I know that the thinking was so that when the arena is built to have a, you know, a. Free spam roof, if you will, that would allow the height that's needed for that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I'm a little concerned that if somewhere down the road the city and national western, because the city will own most of the the land right after it's all purchased. And they could potentially just start marketing the 170 acres once it's all acquired and allow buildings to just be built up to that max limit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm looking for what the protections are, if you will, for the neighbors that could turn this into a new, I don't know, a new mega center, if you will. And I mean, to some degree, it's sort of envisioned that way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I mean, we could have lots of office buildings there or potentially housing on the site, maybe some dorm housing. But I guess I'm wondering where we put some of those limitations that don't allow the whole site to look like 150 acres.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'All right. So there is a transition built in to the zone district and it transitions down to Brayton Boulevard, down to five stories or 70 feet along Brighton Boulevard. And then on the east side of Brighton Boulevard, there's different zoning.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'It allows up to three stories. And on the just east of that alley is the residential area. So the intent of that transition is to provide those protections and transition the height down to the residential area of Elyria.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's not 150 feet across the entire site. There are transitions built in. Now, as far as a new program and marketing the site, I might turn that over to Kelly to to talk about what that means in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm sure.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Councilwoman. So the you know, the question really is how do we kind of protect the integrity of the plant itself? And and really, you refer to the master plan, right? The master plan, which we worked closely with the neighbors on and the national Western and sea issue.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All our partners, you know, shows the the adjacencies of the buildings that are required to fulfill the program of all the partners, the relationships of those buildings to one another, the relationships of those buildings to the adjoining neighborhoods, whether it be Brighton Boulevard or the River or to the Coliseum to the south.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And, you know, although you know what for build out this this center is anticipated to be 270 acres, which seems large, you know, for a site that's close to downtown. When you think about the scale of these buildings and the operational components that these buildings have to accommodate, both from the national, western and other big events, it's'",
        "'speaker_10': 'not that much land in terms of what we see. There's not like going to be a lot of extra land beyond the core program on the site itself for large, massive high rises and what have you. I think, you know, we are going through a process with the Community Advisory Committee and with all our partners to think'",
        "'speaker_10': 'about how do you truly activate the site for year round uses? But all those uses are going to have to be complementary to the core vision of CSU and the National Western in the city as partners in creating this year round destination.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we have a set of guiding principles that will measure all our uses against. We have the needs of our of our tenants, our anchor tenants like CSU in the National Western that have to be met. So I'm confident as we work through this together and that will require coming back to council many, many times as we'",
        "'speaker_10': 'go through this, that we'll, you know, we're going to stay true to the master plan as envisioned.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So which of those additional things that need to be done will come back to city council? Is it I mean, because the master plan is not binding like zoning is. So what what additional approvals will be brought back to city council.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you know, obviously we will have to come back to work for tonight's exercise were only zoning those parcels that are owned by either the city or the national western. So we will come back to council for when additional land is acquired for the campus.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So every time we come back, we'll have to be coming to council for for those actions. The second would be, I think we've shown that we're going to be collaborative and deliberative with council because we're so tied to making sure that the neighborhoods are a part of this conversation, whether it's contracts we issue to actually build the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'site or it's workforce development opportunities or it's housing at the station, near the station, at the National Western, whatever it may be, there's going to be a lot of interactions with council. And and I want to go back to Steve's, you know, example of a development agreement.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We've toyed with the idea do we create some sort of a development agreement that memorializes in contract? That's the obligations that we need to do over the course of the phase development of the site. So I think that's a conversation we want to entertain with with council as well.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I mean, we're we're going to look at all the different tools we have at our disposal. But ultimately, we've got to put in motion documents that hold us accountable for actually delivering the project. So I you know, we'll be coming back to council a lot in the course of at least the next four years.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if I may continue, Mr. President, I have one more question. So I know there have been some discussions about a community benefit agreement and some of the things that should be part of that are should include, you know, provisions for job training and hiring, goals of people in the neighborhood, land leases, tenant leases that might include'",
        "'speaker_7': ', you know, opportunities where people in the community own some of the land that can be rented, things like including opportunities for people who are small business owners in the neighborhood to benefit from some of the relationships and contracting opportunities with National Western.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So where does a community benefit agreement fit into the big picture? Do you see it as part of the development agreement? Where where does that fall? And kind of where where is that in the process in terms of conversations with the neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we you know, we actually presented at a neighbor at a community advisory committee meeting based on ongoing conversations. With many members of the committee of the National Western Center Committee about how do we link in in as deliberate a way possible the the benefits of the two neighborhood plans and that of the national Western that those'",
        "'speaker_10': 'things work together are in tandem. And so I actually threw out the idea based on just kind of my own kind of national view of what's going on around the country, an idea of a of an MRU. You know, I've had a series of meetings with, you know, and conversations with members of the Community Advisory Committee, and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that has evolved. I think the conversation has evolved. We actually had a really good meeting, what, a couple of weeks ago with the members of the National Western Center Advisory Committee about, you know, what's in the mow you now.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And we actually talked about these ideas of implementation committees for the two neighborhoods and the feedback we we've gotten from a variety of groups is maybe that's not the way to go. So we're, we're right now we're, we're listening and we're looking at meeting with all the different groups in those two in those neighborhoods, having constant ways'",
        "'speaker_10': 'for them to provide feedback on budgeting, on, on prioritization of projects within their given neighborhood plans. So I've tried to signal or we've tried to signal that we're open. We're not going to lock ourselves into any one method of of doing business.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'We're going to find different ways to meet them where they are. And that if that means going to the churches are going to the schools or what have you, that's what we're going to do to get feedback, compile all that feedback, and then work with council representatives, work with the mayor's office to then build a work plan'",
        "'speaker_10': '. And at the end of the day, this is all about execution. It's all about implementing what people have spent their time doing. So we're trying to build systems that hold us accountable, hold the neighborhoods collectively accountable with us through shared intent, through shared purpose to deliver.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that at every point, at any given time during the year, we can look at the list and say, we've got these ten things down, we got three more to do. Here's what we're going to do so everybody can follow along.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the memo you just to close this out is is evolving. It's going to actually, based on our last conversation, turn into a letter because the chant, one of the challenges we were having with the image use who signs the Matthew who rep who can represent the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So we're going to do a letter and I'm going to be I've been sharing drafts of the memo. You were going to convert it into a letter over the next week or two, and I'm going to send that back out to the group and get feedback.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So who who does that email you? Who who is it between? Is it between the city or between the city and national western and the neighborhoods?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So good question. So the this isn't just about the national western. There are six projects that are all where we're aligning the planning and implementation of those six project. This is about how do we link the neighborhood plans which are which are part of our six to the other projects that we're managing for shared benefit, right.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So that the intent of what was in my view and now is probably going to become a letter shows that shared intent of how all these six projects are aligned, how they're linked and then our commitment to the neighborhoods that these things are going to happen together.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just got your list, Councilwoman, of things you'd like to see. And so we'll talk about how we build. Some of those things are already kind of built in, but we'll make them more specific and keep sharing that with the community and get to a place where folks are comfortable with the letter.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then we're going to use that as a way to hold it up and say, here's what this is our shared understanding of what we're trying to do together. And then that gets immortalized ultimately in contracts, in workforce development centers and in the things that will be coming back to this body for over the course of time'",
        "'speaker_10': ', that become more legal in nature and more binding in nature.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Karen. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can someone can each.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Madam President. And, Mr. President, I'm sorry. That was another one of those bad habits formed in council monitor as era. Two areas of question probably for Steve, but you can defer to Kelly one about use and two about parking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm very much in the code weeds just for folks. No, because I mean, I think that the this is one of those things where the PowerPoint doesn't have a lot of anything in it. So you have to really look at the code language in terms of uses.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I see the information about husbandry, plant and animal husbandry. I actually don't see anything about manufacturing or production, and I'm concerned about that because in theory, potentially, you may want to be doing something. I mean, maybe not animal slaughter, but maybe other kinds of food production package.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I just am curious whether or not we've thought far enough ahead to include the kinds of ancillary things we may want to be doing related to the CSU type activities. Because I just and maybe I'm just not seeing them.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You're just not seeing it. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So manufacturing at a custom level is is allowed. Manufacturing at general level is allowed manufacturing at a heavy level. And this is like the noxious stuff that's typically that use is only allowed in our industrial zone districts. That is not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So custom instruction can because I can't find it. So if you can point me to the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Situation, if you are seeing the agricultural uses, then you need to turn back a few pages. It'd be under the manufacturing use category.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I've got it here if you want to look.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Just if you give me a section number you don't have. Okay? All right. Like 11 point. Three point. Okay. I see the charts, but I don't see the actual language section. You know, there's the.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So are you, are you looking for the use definition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. Well you have, I mean there's quite a few yet definitions that may be the right.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we did not amend the use. So you have the red lines as well?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I think so. I'm looking at what's in our computer systems.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So you're only seeing what was amended. We did not amend the use definition of manufacture.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's why I can't see it, because you're referencing it, but you're not changing any language. So there's nothing red lines. All right. That's very helpful. So. And then which and is it is it IMX or switch which definition in particular you were saying it's the general and the custom.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So general and custom manufacturing fabrication and assembly are allowed. However, manufacturing fabrication assembly heavy is not allowed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got it. Thank you very much for that clarification. So the other question I had was about parking. So in the chart that, you know, the way that this reads for members of the public is that there's an existing chart that talks about the different uses and then it talks about what parking is required.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then it has all of the different campuses. And we've added a new column for this campus, but there's a lot of red line related to parking requirements. So what I'm trying to understand is, is every time you have a red line related to a parking requirement, does it then apply to all of the campus zone districts'",
        "'speaker_4': '? Because that's kind of the way it looks. It looks like it applies to it looks like we're changing it for all the campuses. Right. And so if you can explain that to me.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So where do you see red line for parking standards that use was not is not permitted in the other campus zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I see. So you had to invent a standard.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So we had to introduce the parking requirement because we're now allowing it in Campus National Research Center. So in all of our use tables throughout the code, if the use is not allowed, we don't put a parking requirement there.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'But to save space, it's not necessary.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Got it. And then the last question and this is a bigger picture question is just I'm curious about doing parking in this way per use. And so we don't know all the uses that are going to be on this site.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I don't think you're going to have each individual building parking itself. Right. So I'm a little curious about the entire approach to parking and why we're using what I think is an approach much more designed for. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Each building on this block is going to be developed and it will have its own parking requirement. In this case, we may be collective izing, and I'm just concerned about whether we're going to actually find ourselves within a margin of these parking requirements, but perhaps not exact.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to build a garage, for example, and then we're going to have a use. So I guess I'm just curious why this approach at all.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. So most all of our uses have minimum parking requirements. Oftentimes, developers build more than that minimum. These minimum parking requirements are consistent with our urban centers and districts with their fairly low minimum parking requirements and will likely be the parking will likely be exceeded.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Campus zone districts are treated as one zoned lot, one site, so a use here can put it's parking way over here. And so collectively, if you add up all of the square footage of the uses, then you get your minimum parking requirement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that needs to be built on that campus somewhere. And likely it will be actually because the minimums are are low.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So just I mean, it's kind of like the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning. Has someone added up all the square footage for the various types that we think we may have in the master plan that we adopted and compared it to the parking to see how they compare?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. I mean, we had a whole, you know, bit of brain damage about the parking asks in a, you know, a generation ago, you know, we couldn't do the National Western Center because the parking requirements were so great that they needed, you know, hundreds more acres.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We brought that back down to, you know, reality. But I just I guess I'm just curious if someone's compared the two.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Yeah. So I've looked into comparing the two. It's an exact science because again, this is this is a minimum requirement. And what you're talking about is more market demand. And so we like to right size the minimum requirement.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it is below the market demand, not way above the market demands. We're not requiring way more parking to be built than what is demanded. And so Kelley can probably speak to a lot of parking studies that are upcoming at the National Western related to the market side, not the requirement side that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah. So, Kelley, do you know in advance that these requirements are compact? Tebow with a parking study that we haven't done yet.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Well, this is you know, we talk. It's a great question. I mean, it's it's you know, we talk about it in the master plan and it continues to be an ongoing conversation. And it also represents an opportunity because the parking studies that we're about to enter into are about getting to the right number and the right mix'",
        "'speaker_10': ', using the right resources. And it's not just about looking at the campus in in isolation. It's about what's going on past the boundaries of the campus itself, the impact of having four commuter rail stations with literally within a mile, mile and a half of this center.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And what might a circulator, as an example, look like, not just for picking folks up from those four stations, but what if you were to introduce an opportunity for, as an example, people to park downtown at the U.S. and and enjoy downtown as they came to the national restaurant?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the study is really starting to hone in on the specific mix of parking resources will need for the campus, but also overlaying the opportunity to leverage either existing assets that exist outside the campus or new assets that are just being built like RTD.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So the study that will go through over the next year will really start to hone in on the right combination of parking needs for this center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Great. And thank you, Mr. President. Performance. Let me just close it out then by saying so you feel okay committing to parking now before this is all that I do. Okay, thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Kathryn Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Oh.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry for going around. Stay away from me. I've got to get the. So this site and the zoning, I'm thinking of, you know, some of the issues and some of the things that have come up in the past and possible uses for the site, things that folks have wanted in the past.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right away I start thinking about grocery store now. Yes, this is campus. Yes, it's structural, but it's also food. Right. And so I'm wondering if there is if one that's allowed by that, that's an allowed use or permitted use.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What kind of grocery store is allowed? What isn't? And also, have there been any discussions? And if you want to just elaborate on that, because I know that's a big need in the community, a need that's been going on for about 40, 50 years.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I think the standard is every meeting we talk about grocery stores and it's been a healthy conversation and look specific to the national western. You know, the National Western's not going to solve that grocery needs for these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. But it can be part of the solution. So one of the components obviously was sea issues, involvement. There's a whole range of things that can happen. But specifically, we're looking at converting the 19 or nine stadium arena, restoring that building to its its luster and converting that into our version of the Pike Street market.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If you've been to Seattle, you know, but for us, it would be all Colorado based products. And I think there's a huge opportunity for the local residents of Coalville response here to work with them and ready to start.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'If they want to start a business and they want to be in the food business, incubate them in the growth event of a business within the 19 or nine building. So that's one opportunity. But we are actually it's a much broader conversation because the the the food desert extends beyond Globeville various wants here to the east.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Right. And so I think working with OPD and working with CPD and the residents really getting to the range of options. And then at the again, just as I said previously, it's about implementing and not waiting for all the packages to be done in terms of grocery.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But what can we do incrementally to start to get services, basic services in these neighborhoods now? And I think we've got to get to build some consensus around that. So we're going to do that in the National Western Center will be part of that conversation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Can I follow up with that? Thank you, Mr. President. And and I really appreciate you expanding on that. I think that's a wonderful idea for the exchange building. And I do I am aware that the food desert is huge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It extends into Commerce City, actually. However, I think that's this is the biggest discussion in the most significant discussion of land use that we've had in this area in a very long time, notwithstanding the the neighborhood plans that just passed successfully.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But I think that's an opportunity. When you look at the specialty market, you say absolutely. You know, absolutely. It provides jobs, provides business opportunity, meets a need. But unless the exchange accepts snap food stamps, it's you know, you were also looking at a different model.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. And a more traditional model. It doesn't have to be huge. But I'm wondering, you know, if we could actually achieve that. Yes. It won't address the needs for the whole area, but at least it'll address one black out here.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And hopefully those discussions are taking place on that site because unless we do something with that site, I don't see very much land out there that we can just convert into, you know, something that would have a grocery store.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, anyway, I just wanted to ask that question. Just throw it out there. But I do appreciate the answer in the thinking forward on that, the forward thinking on it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just one last comment. Actually, it's kind of a question slash comment. Kelly, I'm assuming that in the. The Community Benefit agreement. The issue of truck traffic and especially construction traffic from the site and air quality issues. Those will all be covered.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Can you speak to that?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You're assuming that some of this construction will be going on the same time. We're going to see some of the I-70 construction and trying to keep truck traffic out of the neighborhood is going to be a really big deal to make sure that, you know, we're all working together to address that.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So yeah, I mean, obviously any one of our challenges will be and this isn't just for the national western, but conceivably could have multiple large construction projects happening in this region of the city at the same time. So as an example, it's one of the reasons why we're pushing so hard to get Brighton Boulevard improved in advance'",
        "'speaker_10': 'of both the National Western and I-70 projects beginning so that we do have a route coming out from the South as as an option. You know, we're accelerating in our conversations about Washington Street. We're going to have a technical session this summer on Washington and start to look for ways we can advance Washington Street improvements for the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Denver portion, collaborating with our neighbors to the north. So, look, those are all going to be part of our commitment, right, to the neighborhoods that we're going to work with them on each of these issues. And and I think it's one of the benefits, again, back to the National Western about a phase development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So as we start to focus on the phases, right, we'll be able to be very deliberate about how we get construction traffic into the site, how it leaves versus the whole site being under construction at one time. So you know that that's just a common practice that will work with the neighborhoods on so that they know and'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that their neighbors know how we're going to tackle that project. And my my expectation will be as well, we'll work with CDOT, we'll work with RTD on any project that's going on. And will will bring forward ideas to the neighborhoods of of how we move in and out of these neighborhoods and what the sequencing looks like.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And that will hopefully arrive at a at a reasonable approach for each of these projects. But I mean, that's just good project management practice.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. Any other questions? Three other questions. 324 as amended. Seen none. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Just a little bit confused because this was council bill. This is for Council Bill 324 that if voted on, creates a new zone district called the Campus National Western Center. Is that correct? Okay. So then the next bill that we will look at, 325 will get into see will do an under another explanation'",
        "'speaker_7': 'about the actual official map amendments. Is that correct? Okay. So I want to say that I completely support this going forward, knowing that we're going to talk about the next Bill 325 to get into more specifics about the the amendments to as a reflection of our actual master plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so I would encourage my colleagues to support this as well so we can go on to the next bill and have another conversation about those pieces. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Monteiro. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm just going to make brief comments that will apply to both bills, because I think many of the comments from the public will probably be similar as well. I think what's important about this is we we all we're very vocal about national western talking about moving away.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Denver stepped up and has worked very closely with National Western to do everything possible to keep National Western here to look at the site in a way that we've never really looked at it. And the work that Kelly has done with the support of the administration to pull all of these six projects together and interweave them'",

        "'speaker_7': 'But I also think it's important to note from my perspective that this forward momentum and rezone also gives encouragement to developers and business investment nearby, such as ourselves, that can count on the fact that this is going to happen likely in the future.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so therefore we are willing to spend our money in improving those properties and the people who we bring on to the property in our development who will be creating new businesses. So that will also bring opportunity and prosperity to the adjacent neighborhoods as well.'",

The term Western heritage has different meanings to different people, positive and negative. I think we're at the point in that level of Western history where we can start separating the facts from generalities.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I feel what we have at hand with the national Western efforts, the city and county of Denver's efforts and the neighborhood effort that's gone into. This whole process is. An awakening as to the possibilities that await not just the national western, the city and county of Denver, but all the neighborhoods around, not just Globeville, Elyria and Swansea'",
        "'speaker_8': ', but also Cole. Whittier. Curtis Park. Mm hmm. And even some of the Rhino Place, the new ballpark neighborhoods. It's going to benefit a lot of people. Hopefully it will benefit Globeville and Swansea the most, because that's our self-interest.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With the establishment of the educational effort by CSU and the history, people involved will be able to teach our young kids the true aspects of Western history. Both negative and positive. But more importantly, I see this as a golden opportunity, the best opportunity I've seen.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'In the last 80 years for little kids growing up. Especially close to that area to have opportunities to get into things that we never dreamed of could happen. The whole idea of food science, water plant and animal husbandry, food and the next generation is going to be a big item.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mr. Lopez hit the nail on the head, and we can teach our kids through this process those great possibilities. And I urge you to support this effort. We're going to be here again. JUERGENS You're going to see more of me.'",

In fact, I think sometimes it was the only job they had all year was when they went to work at the stock show. And a lot of the ladies would always make sure they'd always give up their bedrooms and they all ran out their rooms to'",
        "'speaker_7': 'people as the stock shocking suction man came in. They would always there was a lot of people rented out a lot of rooms to the stock show people. And so in town, when the stock show came to town, it was like magic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then we had a little scare because we thought we might lose the structure. It was very, very frightening. And we worked hard. We got a lot of signatures. And the and I hope it helped prove that we really thought a lot to have them stay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Then we got CSU coming on board with us, and I think that's going to be one of the greatest things there is. I was a little disappointed one day when I saw that they said there's parts of Denver they don't think we ought to be called Top Cow Town.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They there was a lot of people don't even know our area of town. It's an old, old area. It's not a rich area, but it's got some of the most wonderful people you could ever know that live in that area.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And they have that's what brought the name in the first place. When I was working down there on the plains in the fall, the cattle would come into town from the farm, from the farms and from the ranches.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We'd sometimes have 40,000 cattle coming in one day on the on the trains and in and then the in on in the end, shipped in. So it was really it was a proper name. And I will always say it is the cow town.'",

I do want to say that the resident participation among the also the National Western Citizens Advisory Committee, I think the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'residential participation for the stock show of the National Western Center has been really great and they've really reached out and there's been a lot of enthusiasm. I think there's really an effort to involve the community. But so so I think that that that that has been that has been great.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But there's a new vision here, I think a very unique vision that's never been tried anywhere else. It's not just another stock show. It's the presence of the CSU and the History Colorado and the Museum of Nature and Science is something totally different.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Nobody really knows what this will be like, and that's very exciting. This will be unique in the nation and probably unique in the in the world. I think that we have a chance to change the history where we may have we no longer isolate institutions from people with this new vision.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'I strongly believe in the catalytic effect of the national western in terms of what it does for the city and particularly for the neighborhoods. I guess I wouldn't be wearing this silly shirt if I didn't believe that that was the case.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I catalytic in the part as a catalytic in the catalytic goods. Obviously, some sort of zoning is necessary and just to basically set the ground rules for what's happening. My concern is that although this is a good start, it not be the end.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is an evolving process. We're talking about a ten or 15 year development cycle. And I think it's important that we not use this zoning to use a Western term as a corral, as basically closing it in, but looking look at it as a free range.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's a lot of opportunities that will be coming up, a lot of opportunities in the neighborhood. The neighborhoods really have been kind of the wasteland in a sense for the last 50 years or so. And I think it's time that we really the Council and the National Western really work together.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The funds from the seed tax, etc., are confined to this zoned area. So I think we need to be open to basically look at some possible expansion in terms of the area. Their needs for that really conserve both the national western and the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we need to seize those opportunities. We need to make it a real campus. We need to get rid of fences and we need to break down those barriers that now are part of national western and open it up to not only the neighborhoods in the city, but the whole country.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'And that I think that the two memorialize the history of these changes, I think would be a great idea. Kelly Lead once made the comment that we ought to write a book on what they discovered in trying to find the boundaries of these properties and that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I think that there is something important there, and I hope that that is understood to be part of the legacy and that there are stories there.

        "'speaker_11': ', partly because our city workers have discovered these mysteries and these incredible historical uncertainties.

        "'speaker_7': 'Now that we are in the next stages of realizing the master plan and building the infrastructure for a national Western, we must also be integrating the human spirit in the neighborhoods where the national western exists. Globeville, Elyria and Swansea.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If National Western is indeed going to be catalytic in nature, incorporating the values of the people in the area into the picture is just as critical as a physical connectivity. Moving the National Western Center text amendments and mapping forward is a step in the right direction for the master plan, but must also include long term sustainable structures'",

I would be extremely disappointed if the neighborhood was marginalized as their time is important and their contributions critical to the health, future and vitality of the neighborhood.'",

I would like to see these amendments as charting a new course for how large scale projects move forward within historic, yet vulnerable neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A new path would include a sustainable structure for inclusive government governance to the neighborhoods and the transformation of the national Western.

No other neighborhoods in the city have been asked to be able to track the amount of public investment coming into and through their neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And my worry is that the neighborhood will be left behind. So I just want to thank everyone again. And it was important for me to put my a little bit of my fears on the record, because my hope is that with the neighborhoods all coming together and all of the work that's been put into this whole process'",

        "'speaker_7': 'If there's any opportunity for the sportsmen to play a neutral part in representing the neighborhoods is that all of these decisions are coming forward.

        "'speaker_0': 'And fast forward here, 2015, a neighborhood coming together, an entire agency formed from the mayor's office. An entire city excited. A ballot measure pending. We have moved really, really fast. And, you know, I just I couldn't be more thrilled to be a part of this.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'And the things that I've been underlining is community input, community engagement, continue to bring the community along, have them at the table, which is great.

        "'speaker_0': '. And so those are some things I'm going to be real focused on. The other piece is when I knocked on a number of doors in Globeville area, Swansea, I was amazed at the number of people who are not a part of the process, the number of people in the community who don't know what's going on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we still have a lot of work to do in trying to get folks to the meeting, trying to get folks to be a part of this, in way in to what they're, you know, these decisions that we're making.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So while I think we've we've come a long way, there's still a lot of work that we have to do. And I think the people in this room are ready for it. And so I just want to thank Councilman Monteiro again for for working hard.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All of the bills tonight have been in your district, so that says a little something. She's been incredibly busy, but not just busy. I think there's a bunch of neighbors who support all the work that you've been doing.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So great work. And as as far as the community, thank you for your involvement. We've got a lot of work to do. We're going to keep working hard and and we'll be there to keep moving the ball down the field.'",

This idea that's before you tonight is important for several reasons. One, it helps us fund the project, helps fill a gap that existed in funding this, as everybody knows, at the state level or at the city level'",
        "'speaker_8': '. There are not a lot of funds floating around. And we've we've been struggling to put together some of that funding, which this is this in to it addresses an important risk element of this project, the drainage the storm drainage aspect of the problem, which we think is quite important.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think Tony can answer questions about that. Third, and most important in my mind is to underscore again what Diane pointed out. We have got a project that fundamentally involves the interest not only of the state, but of the largest city and county within the state.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And without a measure of cooperation between those two entities, the people who are out there ready to invest tens of millions, maybe even hundreds of millions of dollars in this project, raise their eyebrows in terms of wondering whether the political risk of the of the project is worth it.'",

I found out that fortunately somebody called me a week ago saying, you know, that we've made $83 million agreement with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'No public hearings, no meetings, no nothing for this. I support the drainage project, but I think it's very devious for the city to try to roll this package together to ram through the I-70 project. In this way, we put a lot of work into comments for the draft, the supplemental draft, EIA.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yes. And that the final yes is not coming out till January. We have no idea and no faith that any of our concerns will ever be met. What guarantee is there? They're not even talking to us. This was some backroom behind the scenes deal done with the city.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And see, Don, there's there's too many disturbing things about this for me in 3 minutes to go into it. But there's just and I'll mention a few this CDOT is using a ten year old study to justify ten lanes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, there's many people who will say that a NEPA process five years is the shelf life of a of a study the unacceptable 300 feet wide highway. We're not sure we need this the funding mechanism and mechanisms of privatizing the highway with toll lanes.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So these are very questionable. We can't get air monitoring or any kind of sufficient health study. We've never gotten answers of what will be the construction impacts that the impacts to the neighborhood during construction. None of these issues are being addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When when will we talk about them? You know, you're making these agreements in our behalf that we're paying for. And what and what what say do we have in this process? I feel you're giving away everything to see that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Why doesn't the city represent the residents of Denver? You know, one of the things that I really don't understand is I hear city officials say this is a done deal. I don't understand what you've done, what's done about it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I keep hearing this. You know, you've got your your chorus all saying this is a done deal. There's a lot to be done yet before this is done. We need to have a public discussion about this. And there's many people who wanted to come tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'First of all, I wasn't going to come. It's 10:00. But there's many people who are really boycotting this hearing and won't come tonight just because they don't like the way that this was rolled in with all of the other projects.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Judy, I really would have like to end on a high note, but, you know, I'm afraid this is difficult. You know, the really most harmful thing about this is there's a lot of goodwill that we had built up in a lot of the other processes, the neighborhood processes, the National Western Center.'",

And so to that end, while there's a ton of work to be done and the details of exactly how these two drainage projects almost come together to be one drainage project, there's a ton of work still to be done, but'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I have full faith that the groups will be all of those things that I.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Just described.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And thank you.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next is Betty Crane. And as Betty comes up, I'll go ahead and call the next six speakers. Just so you know, it's David Bennett, John's AP. And no, let me go. Cindy, said Stritch, David Wolinsky and Ann Elizabeth.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So you all can certainly make your way up to the first two pews. And Ms.. Graham, you may begin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you so much. I'll start out by saying I live in the area and when you go down there, sometimes, sometimes you find a little bit of cement laying around. It's just what's fallen from the highway. And so this is to who?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's concerning. Little chicken said the sky is falling and Denver County says no I-70 may fall. See, that said no. We will make a new I-70 and we will do what is right for the neighborhood. Really? I thought that issue was settled with a new raised viaduct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It would come north and have eight new lanes. Now you say that you need more than eight lanes. You will not build a new viaduct. So now the plan is to have ten lanes to toll roads. This will gobble up a lot of our historic area because now it has to be a 30 foot deep trench.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At least ten lanes slide and about 20 blocks long. Not to mention the two access roads to run along the side of the highway. This will destroy over 60 homes and over 20 businesses. This trench will have no exit along the route.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You state you will build a lane or park over the highway in front of the school. But the city will have to do the maintenance and the care of the park. There will be a network of side roads for travel in the local area, which will bring a lot of local traffic trucks into the area in order'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to get an entrance to I-70 east or west. Two concerns in our area are the filtering of the water away from the 30 foot trench and the salt pollution that will be a problem near the school and the residential areas close to I-70.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Why does it seem this area from Brighton Boulevard to Colorado Boulevard is a target for your toll road? I don't hear of any other toll roads planned for about ten years in this little area. This toll road is not fair to the local citizens who are the working class, poor, poor class, nor for the local traffic that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'would come through to the National Western Center would be traveling through the area to see that in Denver. Please scratch your heads a little longer and come up with a better plan for us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. David Bennett.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Good evening. My name is David Bennett. I'm with the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District, and I'm here representing the district who is a partner with the city and county of Denver on this project. Now, for those of you that don't know the district, we work with local government.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So we've been working with Denver on this project for a number of years in the planning phases, the design phases, and then we'll be partnering with them in the implementation phase. We also provide a technical resource of drainage and flood control.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We helped guide the vision and most importantly, were a funding partner in this project at about 11 and a half million dollars. This is a very important project from the drainage perspective. We've been working on it for a number of years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think the solution we're proposing is innovative. It meets a lot of the needs and you're getting a much upgraded system from five year to 100 year. So from our perspective, the drainage perspective, this is a great a great improvement for the area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So basically, we're in support of this bill. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Mr. Bennett. Next is John Sapin.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, here we go again. I agree with almost everything this lady said initially. I wish I wish we would have heard this ten years ago or even eight years ago. The former head of Public Works, Bill Fidel, was in the neighborhood and he didn't say a damn thing about this urban drainage.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You knew about this such.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'A long time. Why did you not come to our neighborhood? You have the wherewithal to do that, at least some public notice of some sort. We've got we've got this issue and it's I, I won't use the term devious, but I think it lacks some veracity.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It would have been really an addition to the goodwill with C dot if this would have come up at one of the neighborhood. Me. How long up?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'God. How many meetings we've had in the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Last ten years or so? The main concern that I have about the drainage thing is that. When this project's complete. It's a funnel at Washington Street, and the next project is going to be expansion of I-70 through Globeville.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We've had a hate relationship with the Colorado Department of Highways since the fifties, and that's ingrained. And I'll admit there's some bias. But but to deal with this amount of money that your grandkids, our grandkids are going to be paying for this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah. And there's no end in sight. I think it has to be addressed and it has to be dealt with. But I don't think this is the way to do it. There's a public.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Process that hadn't.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Taken place, and we're talking about a lot of money. And, you know, I hope it's not a done deal because like I say, I don't think it's devious, but the term veracity is up in the area. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Now let me go.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Good evening. Thank you, Mr. President. Hello, councilmembers. My name is Nolan Miguel. I live.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At 4930.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Vallejo Street. I know many of you. I worked for Councilman Monteiro for the last three years and just had my first day today as the new director for Global Air since I live well in Focus Points Family Resource Center.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm here today as just me and I really appreciate the deliberation intention that you all have given to this issue. I know that you just found out about this idea several weeks ago as well and have been rummaging through it and trying to process it as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I just want to say, we will need your continued support on this I-70 project. This isn't it. We're not done. This isn't a final agreement. There's a lot more that we need to work on together and appreciate your continued support.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I generally support this idea going through because the drainage project is so huge and important to the neighborhood as a benefit. We just saw that recently with the floods of 46th Street was filling up with water. Washington Street was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is a huge, huge need in the neighborhood. I understand that having an agreement with the city is important to see that to be able to move forward with the contractor. I also understand that in order to get these this drainage agreement, there had to be this larger package that had to be negotiated in order to get'",
        "'speaker_4': 'this and that. That's kind of how ideas work. But I just want to say, in no way that we're that this that we're done, that this is it in working with the city or CEDA and addressing all the concerns and the priorities that the neighborhood has.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is not mitigation. We're still working on mitigation. We still have the RFP. That is critical document. We still have the final year and other critical document. These are all things that we're going to be working with residents on and pushing for long term solutions to the impact that this project is going to have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman Monteiro has worked to establish structures around housing, health, jobs and education to get some of these priorities addressed. You know, we have a lot of things that we'd like to see happen. We'd like to have a percentage of the projects, for instance, go to training in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They did.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I-64 in Missouri. We'd love to see business opportunities rerouting truck traffic in the neighborhood, increase services to 500 feet from the highway, jobs, replacement, housing for neighborhood viability, all of these things. But these aren't things that are appropriate for being in this idea at this time.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There are some things that would be appropriate to have maybe in the idea, such as narrowing the footprint of the highway or maybe looking at other regional solutions to, oh, it's over to the to the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Issues in for I-70 and also 47th in York. That's a big one. Sorry, I could keep going, but overall, I support this. And we're looking to Tony to to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Director, to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To make sure it is to keep working with us in the future.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Thank you. Cindy says, stretching. And I apologize if I mispronounced that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm Cindy Sestak. I live in District ten of Denver. And I am here today as a spokesperson for the Denver League of Women Voters. Would you. And thank you again for scheduling this special hearing. We do.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Please put our letter of June 24th into the record.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where we voiced our concerns.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Regarding transparency and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public process and prudent use of taxpayer.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Money for the nurses drainage and I-70 project funding. We agree this project is necessary.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'However, we have observed meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Televised and in-person.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Where questions have been.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Where questions asked haven't been fully answered in public. The data needed to justify your upcoming decision to approve these large amounts of funding.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Hasn't been published.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Or noticed noted in meetings that we can find.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Outside experts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Should be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Allowed to audit the cost sharing agreements and long term funding obligations of taxpayers funds prior to making your final decision.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'At a minimum, you are obligating.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nearly 200 million.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'For.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Drainage projects, transportation enhancements and in-kind contributions, which are lost revenue for the city of Denver. But this agreement appears to be open ended with unforeseen consequences for years to come. There's a lot of funding involved. We think this agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As stated, is too vague.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For this a large amount of taxpayer obligation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Therefore, we urge.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You to vote no tonight and allow the incoming council to give the time and attention this project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Deserves to fulfill City Council's duty to the citizens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of Denver. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. David Wolinsky.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. My name is David. Let's give me a Globeville resident. I live in 4930 Logan Street, and I've been to a lot of meetings, and I. Never heard anyone support the I-70 project. We always denied it. But you're still moving on with it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I can understand Drew Tucker's frustration, you know, and. You know, June 16th, 50 years ago, that river flooded and this year it was pushed to capacity. And then we had Cherry Creek with that that that that that that freak rainstorm or whatever we had.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why did you study this? Did you study it after this year? You didn't study that for this rainy season, have you? You know, I, I this is going to be rethought. I mean, they're going to have a new conversation.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I mean, we don't know what the future is going to hold. I've never seen this kind of rain that we got this year walking that river constantly. You know, I seen the 65 flood. I was ten years old.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'It was the scariest thing you can ever imagine, you know, and and watch this river run high the way it is. I drive the trolley down there down on College Park and just walking that river high and low, lying low in the snowpack in the runoff we've had.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I think he's a under thinking this. You know and it ain't going to work. It's just not going to work. You're putting that up. You're putting that highway under river level, you know. Are they are you engineers going to be held accountable or responsible if this thing floods and there's death?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Or is that is that figured into. I don't think it is. You know, I mean, if you're if you're a bus driver and you get drunk and you and you crash your bus, you're held responsible. We need to start holding these engineers responsible because they're doing some things that I don't know if it's ever been done in'",
        "'speaker_8': 'this state. I've never seen it, you know. And, you know, if you if you did take if this isn't a done deal and you did move I-70 out, you know, there's a fortune in land sitting there that we could we could heal all our ills, our housing problems, you name it, it and the developers.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'This is a perfect time. Colorado now just moved in a number one spot for housing. And we're going to stay hot for a lot of years to come, you know, and if you turned I-70 and even into a boulevard and you moved it out financially, we could go ahead and and do it because the property values is'",
        "'speaker_8': 'going to be there. Well, you know, we looking at we don't have enough land. Well, there's a lot of land under there and it's an ideal location. And I think this has to be rethought. We got to really look at it.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And, you know, we just this the way these floodings happened, the way there's water, the way the rains are coming, it's never done that before. John and I were talking. We've never seen it rain like that. Debbie's a longtime resident.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You or have you ever seen it rain like this? I've never seen it rain.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Leslie, your 3 minutes is up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, sir. Last speaker and Elizabeth.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'My name is Anne Elizabeth Glanville, and I'm a past member of the Steering, the Globeville Neighborhood Planning Steering Committee and associated member of the Elyria Swansea Steering Committee for the Plan, Neighborhood Planning and a National Western Center Advisory Committee member.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It is a reflection of the exhaustion of people and people that are boycotting this that several of us are speaking several times. And I do want to say the tip of the iceberg is here. I normally very much would support the drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'We need this. And I think Denver is rising justifiably with some exciting commitment to the drainage project. But I would and I and I want to say that I have had extremely good responsiveness and I'm working diligently with Cedar at all levels to get better communication out.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And I'm very excited at the possibility of greater engagement. And with that, I would ask the city council to defer this for 45 days after the new council comes on. Do your job to make your case. Let there be some more public conversation, with all due respect, a sentiment that you've worked hard on.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And so I hope the council this council can be the one to pass. It is not a good reason to pass something. Judy Montero is right that the neighborhoods need not to be sidelined. And I'm going to say to you with my heart, in parallel to what you're asking, we're keeping the community engaged and not marginalized.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Please ask for this to be passed in 45 days and not before so that we can have more engagement and have more explanation as to the ramifications of this. The elephant in the room is, of course, that people that there is not a consensus in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'There are unanswered questions. What are the ramifications? I have disassociated from the time from some of the culture, the leadership of the reroute group that I do not feel does build goodwill within the neighborhood. I also am very concerned that some of the research that's being generated around the possibility needs to be vetted more strongly.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And we need to let the the Federal Highway Commission process complete itself. I am very in awe attending Transportation Commission meetings, looking at the HPT and the the the bridge is conversations that the individuals in this room that are doing a spectacular job trying to come up with a good, creative and innovative way to deal with the'",
        "'speaker_11': 'highway project that has a serious financial shortfall. We are not each other's enemies and we need to engage with each other better. We need more explanations as to why is this the solution and more guarantees that truly this is for the best interests of the neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Plural, by the way. Welcome to District nine. Mr. Albert. But you continually say the neighborhood has come together globally. Swans here, three neighborhoods. You'll get it. Plural. Three neighborhoods. There are more. You know, I'm. This is part of the full understanding of this.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So I would ask the council. I embrace that partnership with the city on the flooding project. But it is also the case that this is marrying the partially covered, lowered option with particulars that are up in the air.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And let's let the process get a little bit further and let's let's give it another 45 days, bridge it to the new council and let's have more public exposure of the issues in the ramifications.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That concludes our speakers. Time for questions. We are. I have a list. Councilman Brooks, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. I live seven blocks from these neighborhoods, so I do know that there are three neighborhoods. But I wanted to bring up Diane and also Leslie, and I'm going to go. You did a great presentation, nice summary of kind of what we're going through here.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But number three is, is the big issue and it's around I've gotten a lot of emails saying is this does this IGA give neighborhoods the last kind of bite at the apple? Will they have other other opportunities to comment and to talk about some frustrations and some issues?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so maybe, Leslie, this would be better for you. I'd love for you to read into the record. I found this the the the FDIC review process plan. And I want you to just it's going to take a little bit of time, but I want you to go through it, talk about the number of days that council'",
        "'speaker_0': 'and the community have to speak into each one of these issues. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Good evening. I'm Leslie Thomas. I'm the city engineer and deputy director of Public Works. So we have prepared our team and public works like what we did with the supplemental draft as a whole. Plan for the review of the final year, which is now scheduled.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Our best information is that it will be available for public review January 15th of 2016. So what we've prepared is.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A tentative.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I-70 East Project FISA review process. It includes three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Steps review.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Preparation. So what we do in that timeframe, it's about two months starting in October excuse me, August and ending in October. And it has steps that take a look at verifying the technical folks within the city to review the study.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Excuse me, who did review the supplemental draft?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This it's been a little while, so we want to be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Sure we have the right folks. We'll take a look at the past comments that we got from council and technical folks and that what we've heard in a series.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of public meetings that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public works and Councilwoman Monteiro, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Organized with the community, I think about January, December through March this year.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We did that specifically so that we could understand that the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Comments that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We did submit to see that were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Resonating with the community. I want.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To let you know that two of the big ones that we did talk about were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Drainage and traffic. In the neighborhoods. There are multiple, but I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Won't tell you all about those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We also want to confirm that the what the prior mitigations were that we requested requested so we can have that at our fingertips. We'll also be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Reaching out to the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Administration.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Cabinet levels and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Managers as well as to city council to bring.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everyone up to speed and remind us of what we.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Did about a year ago. Then we will spend about 30 days doing training. That will be training of our staff who technical staff who will be taking a look at this FISA as well as reaching out to council and council staff.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a there's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'A lot of comments and it will be a very large document that we need to review within.'",
        "'speaker_7': '30 days.'",
        "'speaker_4': '30 calendar days of receiving the document. So we want to have everybody poised and ready to go to read their favorite sections in a way to pull those comments together, starting once we receive it. Expected in January will begin a staff review with issue escalation among the technical folks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As well as working with council to help collect the comments and put them together if that's what council desires. I believe in the stages. We had a administration and technical letter.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And we also had several.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Letters from council and that is totally okay. We're here to help and facilitate that. That'll give us a few days.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's about two weeks to review it, so it's a lot of work to do. In a couple of weeks we'll.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Send spend a week to compile it and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Then send comments out to see that during this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Time, the this 30.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Days.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The neighbors, the citizens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can all comment as well while we're doing that and those comments can be.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Made directly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To see that. So right now, this is our tentative based upon the timeline that we have from Syria, but we'll be preparing in that way.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Mr. President, just let me just get that in summary. That was that was good. Thank you. We're going to review and prep for 62 days. We're going to do a training for 31 days. We're going to have review, comments and resolution complete and submit comments for another 30 days, which, you know, is about 123 days.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we as specific council members can work with community leaders, community folks to compile all of these comments to submit into the office. Okay. One more question. All right, Mr. President, I haven't talked tonight. You know, we have gotten a lot of residents in Park Hill, a lot of residents in on the east side of Denver, a'",
        "'speaker_0': 'lot of residents and guess who have have been emailing me about, you know, the issues with the flooding at a very high level. And technical. How bad is is the Park Hill Basin in the Moncler Basin.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There a big.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Challenge because they are a drainage way that was built over.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the city back in the 18 and.'",
        "'speaker_4': '1900s. And I think when Paul Heineman discussed this at committee, he was pretty concerned.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And thought that if we did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Receive excuse me, 100.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Year storm.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'In this basin, that it could be Katrina like I think is what he use.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it's a concern and we're excited.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To have a partnership with that, to be able to take this on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And one more question. If we weren't able to partner or figure out a catalytic project to leverage dollars on. I want to make sure I got this right from Diane. We would only be able to build a five year storm drainage system.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yes, that's correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Five years is about an inch in an hour and 100 years is about 2.6 inches in an hour.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So what we saw recently in the basin was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Two inches in an hour.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Which is about a.'",
        "'speaker_7': '25 year storm, which we had.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Some significant impacts.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we're happy to be able to give a higher level of protection.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman, can each Brooks think outside? Brooks, I'm staring at Lopez's name I that my apologies. Katherine McGinnis.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to just pick up Leslie, if I can just close and then I have some questions that I think I would like to have urban drainage answer as well. But I just want to clarify.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So when we had speakers say you should reevaluate the project in light of recent rain, recent rain, what was the highest level of rain we had recently? In this area. What I saw was about two inches.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But Dave, is that correct? Dave Bennetts with there urban drainage, they keep track of it with rain gauges.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So you could stand up and just confirm. And I think I'd like to hear it from you since you're the drainage expert.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We've had a very wet spring, as everyone's aware of the rainstorm we had last week. We were seeing close to 2.6 inches of rain in some of the areas. Very intense rain in a very short period of time.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You mentioned, I believe, that we were seeing high flooding on the South Platte River. We had the fourth highest recording flow ever on the South Platte River that week at 14,300 cubic feet per second. So it was a very significant event with a very short, intense rainstorm.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I think, as Paul was alluding to earlier, if you move that to a different basin that doesn't really have the infrastructure to handle it, it could have been quite a devastating event. There was some localized flooding and flooding, but it really centered over Cherry Creek and that's why Cherry Creek flows were so high.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. And so can I clarify then? Because I think the question that got asked is we've all been talking about how great this proposal is. Is it good enough is if we've recently had that level of rain?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is the plan that you have for a similar level of rain adequate.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'For what we're talking about for the basins right now? Yes. I mean, we've been looking at this for a number of years, and I think we're confident as we move ahead that this is a great plan to address that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is there any area of the city that has a higher level of protection than the 100 year level or.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'There's other areas that certainly do have higher levels of protection? I think Leslie alluded to the fact that the city basically built over the drainage way, even in some of the other drainage ways, like Harvard Gulch or Wesley Creek, still existed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'They maybe couldn't carry the capacity, but we completely buried this one and it's not there. And so now that's why it's so expensive. We have to go back and recreate 100 year storm. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Got it. So. So there may be areas that are at less risk, but it's because they were never at this high of a risk. We didn't bring them back from the brink. That was correct. This area back us.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you. So my next question is about process. I'm familiar with the work that you all did around the Globeville Basin, where there were public meetings, there was a series of discussions, and then the entire approach made it into an urban drainage plan that was adopted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It feels to the residents like this process did not follow that same approach. Is that accurate? And if so, why?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Basically, the city took the lead on the public relations part of this. So all of these discussions have been part of this ongoing plan. So urban drainage did not specifically hold a meeting to talk about this because it's been this part of this larger plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But we've been talking about this project for five or six years. So.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. So maybe the city would like to speak to this question of so I guess feel free to respond generally, but I want to even be more pointed. When did the discussion begin with see that for this particular AG that we're seeing today, where the drainage project became a piece of the discussion.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We started a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Multi-Agency technical team in October of 2013, and it had to do with solving issues surrounding the RTD.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Eagle line.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That cuts through this basin where.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There were significant.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Drainage concerns as.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well as with see that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'As they announced their partially covered lowered section. And so we worked with urban drainage.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And each of those other entities.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Engineering consultants to figure out what the flows.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Were.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'These are technical pieces of information that everyone needs to be on the same page with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we came up with this recommendation that you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'See coming forward to you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'To basically leverage all of the improvements that each of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public entities were planning to work on in order.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To come up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'With this one solution that benefits all of us. Now, the challenge that we've.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Had is that until.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We were able to bring this agreement to you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We did not have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Seat outs, agreements in place to be able to make the commitment to the 100 year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Storm. So we've been working on a five year storm up until that point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As well as RTD. That's the level of effort that they did. So with this idea and this approval in price.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We'll be able to move forward with 100 year strategy and service level, which we're really excited to do. I guess we need to kind of. Ask to put. I need to push a little more to understand better, because all the time we as a city has plans we don't have funding for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We go out, we have process, we have discussion. The Globeville Junction drainage plan is not funded. It it may not be funded for a decade or more, but we had public meetings and we had discussions. So I guess I don't understand why we could not or did not have any public meeting because we didn't yet have the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'funding commitment. To me, planning and design and what kind of flood protection we need is a very different conversation than how we're going to pay for it. And so, I guess help the residents and help me understand why.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And how is it that we did not have any public discussion about the solution?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, I guess.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Put it this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One thing to add, we.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Have gone to the community as to whether this is a problem. We did have public meetings on our.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Outfall, our.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'High street outfall.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'From 40th.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Down to the river.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We haven't gone up in.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The basin because, to be honest with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You, we didn't know whether we're going to be able to do.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It. We do have urban drainage now under.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Contract and there designers under contract us help us to do it. So we're ready to go now.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, I guess that's not very satisfying when we have meetings all the time for projects we don't have funding for. But I will let it go because you've done your best. We met.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Well, just to add another thing, we did have our folks from Urban Drainage and our master plan folks at the end.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Public meeting several times for months about this particular. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Showing the issues that we had. But was it an actual.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'OSP, which maybe I'm too technical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here is what you're talking about in Globeville, where they had a specific public meeting.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have not had one of those yet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we have carried this issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Forward and had Shay Thomas.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And others from Urban Drainage. Selina Koslowski are engineers at the DCC meetings.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Talk about the issue.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And show the pictures that we're showing in the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Iwga generally as to what the solution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Is. I have some more questions for seerat, but I can seed and go back in the queue if someone else wants to. Mr. President, it's your pleasure, but I have another line of question.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I hope we can come back to you, Councilwoman and Councilman Lopez, Europe. Thank you. My question is that we can't make the microphone. Microphone.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'My question is addressed by Mr. Bernanke. He addressed it eloquently. He already did. You already did that. So our next speaker.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And I am going to move from the stormwater issue, which I am convinced is necessary. And I'm delighted that in this agreement the state is stepping up with this 6040 share there being 40. But I want to talk about the 83 million that we are putting into the transportation piece.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think my first question is probably for Diane Barrett. I am thinking that I used to hear Don Hunt talk about the total cost of the I-70 project, and I haven't heard Salem bought talk about it yet.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But what I'm remembering is the total cost of the project is about 800 million up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We're if we're talking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About hard costs, I think 800 to.'",
        "'speaker_7': '1.8 billion is about that's what we've been that's what we've been working.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Toward. Obviously, the cost of the project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Won't be truly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Known until.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The builders have done their.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thing and we've had the.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Procurement. So do you think the 83 million in this agreement we keep talking about future bites of the apple for. Mitigation and things that may be in the final year. But do you think the 83 million is our total commitment in terms of the transportation piece of the I-70 project?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Have have we taken our final bite at that one? Yes. Okay. So then.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman, I think it might be a little.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bit confusing to use the 83.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have $37 million that's dollars on the table that we're paying for things that we're getting. Right. The other portion of your 83. Some of it is actual dollars in the sense of relief from permit fees, for instance, and that sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Others are a bit more.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Nebulous in that there's $10 million in this instance for risk, that sort of thing. So it's kind of it's kind of apples and oranges.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So probably better to talk about the 37 million and then.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The in-kind support perhaps.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Yeah, I just think some of the income. Well, let me talk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About it any way you want because.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Related to that, to the in-kind. I want to know about the slip ramps and bypass lanes because I call those access roads. Am I calling them the right thing?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I would love to have Tony DeVito talk to this because I'm not a traffic controller.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But let me get there's a bigger question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So my thing is mostly the neighbors and some of us are council didn't want the highway right away to be so large, and yet we're contributing to making it wider white. Why are we paying for that piece of it?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because in the last analysis, we ended it. And I do need Tony. In the last analysis, we ended up agreeing with, see that that that this Steele and Vasquez intersection and the Colorado Boulevard intersection.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Would be two halves of a hole.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what happens is the bookends.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'No, that's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not the bookends. That's something different. I'm sorry. That's mine. I'll explain that, too. But. But the way the intersection works.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Traffic would be dumped.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Into the neighborhoods like that. Whereas if the slip ramps are built, the traffic will be dispersed and disseminated as it comes off the highway. So it's not coming out in large numbers all at the same time. Tony, do it more.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do it better, please.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'T-Rex. T-Rex. Talk about T-Rex.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. The interchanges of Vasquez and Colorado are two independent split diamonds. As we move into the final design of what's being proposed, and it's actually a $1.17 billion project is as we're moving forward. It was working with the city of Denver is trying to identify how those interchanges could best work not only from an interstate, but also'",
        "'speaker_5': 'not end up in a situation where people would bypass the interstate and use more of a local system. This was something that the city and county of Denver traffic engineers made very clear and evident that these slip ramps and bypass lanes were needed to try to better negotiate that weave on the interstate template and not into the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'neighborhood. And so it was a request from the city and actually a slight detriment to the interstate operation to incorporate this. And in working with our federal partners, we've come to an agreement on that.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Actually, that explanation was helpful to me and hopefully to the neighborhood because I'm not at every neighborhood meeting. I have another question. And Tony, it might be for you as much as for Diane Barrett. The agreement says, see, DOT will consider abandonment of Brighton Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's it mean will consider I mean, is it going to be abandoned or not?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Abandonment is performed as an action of the commission. That action has not happened. So as part of our agreement, once it's finalized at this level, we will take it to our Transportation Commission. At that point, our commission will always rules on abandonment of state owned properties.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, this is a section of old historic connector in there that really doesn't serve as a a an interstate or a highway or a state local collector. It really serves as more of a local road, and it's just something that has been on our system for way too long.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So I think we discussed this in the meeting and I'm always interested in it because I've had constituents who would love to see devolution of Colfax Boulevard so that we could make it a little more urban and, you know, be a little freer with the access points and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But this is a very short stretch that you're talking about.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Less than a mile, I believe it's less than a mile.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Already those those are my questions on the transportation piece. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Well, there you go, Councilwoman Ortega. You're up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Let's see what you make coming back to the microphone, please. So you described a process that the city is going to engage in prior to the EIA being released. So what I'm not clear about is if Denver is going to receive that information prior to the release or if you're just prepping for the release of'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the final year. We're prepping for the release of the final. EA's will receive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It at the same time as the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Public does in January of 2016. Okay. Are there ongoing negotiations between Denver and CDOT around some of the other issues that were in many of the responses that came from the neighborhood? Some of them came from city council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Some of them came from some of the neighborhood associations. You know, Denver had a lot of comments as well that overlapped with some of those issues that came from those various groups that I just mentioned. So are there still some of those ongoing negotiations happening right now?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What we are working with Don on is the preparation.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'For the RFP for the contractors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'See, that is we received five responses, four qualifications. And in those.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Technical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Conversations, we are working on things like the air quality, the construction, how.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Traffic mitigation for soils or I miss mitigation maybe isn't the right word.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sorry, it's a little late for me. I'm in awe of all of you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But anyway, materials handling, that type of thing that we were always.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Keep in mind and review the comments.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That were provided to us and that we did during the year to put in place into the contract the right things.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To address them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if they're in the contract and we assume that some of those things are going to be clearly addressed in the final year if it's part of what's being negotiated between Denver and Cedar. Yeah. As a part of the RFP and Tony, you can jump in here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Things that go in there would be what the contractors would.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Need to respond to. Do you want to add?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Again. Tony DeVito, project director. To answer that question, there was over 900 or 2000 comments through the supplemental draft. Yes. That are being responses. Are we prepared? And those will be released as part of the office. In addition to that part of the office, there is another 30 day comment period that ensues along with we'll have scheduled'",
        "'speaker_5': 'meetings with the public in August, August 18th, 19th and 20th, where we will go back out and talk about the office. We'll talk about a little bit of the transparency requirements in what's involved in a public private partnership.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Like I said, again, 30 day review period and then public meetings also in January with the release of the office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So the public meeting in August will be just to convey to the community what the process will be for when the final year is released. Correct. Correct. Okay. So the since I have you up there, Tony did draft the supplemental draft called for the lead over the highway being mitigation.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So why is it that Denver is being asked to pay for the some of the improvements and the maintenance of that lit? Because I've been told by a C dot person and this was when several of us went and did the tour in Seattle of Delayed so we could see what that looks like and how they were'",
        "'speaker_7': 'maintained. We were told that anything that is considered mitigation is the responsibility of CDOT to maintain it. And, you know, in all the communication that was with the neighborhoods, the neighborhoods were told they would have input into designing it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that's been sort of a separate process that ended up happening with Denver Public Schools. I think there will be some benefit to the neighborhood, and I'm grateful that it's not going to be gated or locked most of the time, as was originally talked about.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But help me understand why Denver is paying for that when it is considered mitigation, which is normally the responsibility of the transportation agency.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a fair question. You know, as we as we've worked through this shared negotiation, it is very evident that what we want to provide as the identified mitigation to the school and as a connection to the two communities, wasn't met with full acceptance of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The city and some of the other members that we were working with identified additional types of uses on top. You seek a balance point, especially when you start looking at maybe some of the different types of loading that can associate with that.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we meant we came up with the agreement that fine, whatever is ultimately designed on top, we will design and pay for that structural underneath. And then as as a good negotiation, you have to look at then the tradeoffs.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, as far as anybody that would we would probably want to encourage some sort of trust development or something to come in here and really be the the group that maintains this. Especially when we get into some of the landscaping grasses, that's just not see, that's fortes.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So if it's a third party, but the cities in this agreement obligating themselves to pay for the ongoing maintenance, then the long term expectation is that Denver's going to pay the cost of some third party to handle the maintenance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. That's very disturbing that we on the hook for what could be a 50 year project, assuming that lasts longer then than an elevated structure where, you know, the first few years, it's going to be nice, it's going to look nice, but over time it will deteriorate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And, you know, it's subject to annual appropriation from the city to ensure that the funding continues to be there. We're obligating taxpayers to $2.5 million for the next 30 years. These are concerns. So I guess. I guess I'm preaching now, so I'm not going to continue.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know Councilwoman Kennedy had some additional questions, but I guess I'm disturbed that we're we're giving up so much right now and any leverage we have to ensure that the kinds of things that we want to see in the final year, there's no guarantee.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And to I mean, for me, this is very similar to when we were asked to approve a proclamation committing to the preferred alternative where we hadn't seen the supplemental draft of what was going to be in there. And again, this was Denver had been having conversations with CDOT about, you know, what was going to happen at Vasquez'",
        "'speaker_7': 'and Colorado Boulevard and. This is very similar to that, where we don't know what's going to be in the final e-mails. But we're asking we're being asked to make commitments now about. You know, the drainage project is absolutely critical for all of these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I support the drainage project, but I'm I'm having heartburn with how we're doing this by putting all of these things together and yet not ensuring that the things that need to happen to these neighborhoods which have paid the price for this highway project.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And Tony, as you well know, under the NEPA process in Title six, which is part of the Civil Rights Act and part of the, you know, environmental justice, that has to happen with this project. These neighborhoods can look at past harm to these communities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And it's frustrating to know that that stuff is sort of being pushed off to a back burner and being told, trust me, these neighborhoods have heard that too many times. I mean, you know, the on and off ramps don't get maintained ever in these neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we're talking about the lead over the highway that's going to have some beautification improvements. So, you know, we're not only talking about the on and off ramps and what's going to happen with those and what the retaining walls are going to look like and some of those other kinds of things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I guess I'm just very concerned and disturbed and. We've been involved in this process for the last two and a half years on a weekly basis, sitting in on meetings with with Saeeda and with Denver and trying to work through ensuring full engagement with the neighborhoods and.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You heard people here talking tonight. They didn't know about any of these details. And, you know, yes, the drainage has been part of the conversations, but not the details of how all of this was going to be financed and what kind of long term commitments we're asking Denver taxpayers to make on this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm going to stop with that so that other colleagues can ask their questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Canete, you're back.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Two areas of question. Yes, stay there. So my previous questions just to share were based on the testimony that surprised me. I did not know. We'd never had a dedicated meeting about drainage. That's to me, just a missed opportunity that I did not know about until tonight's testimony.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What I expected to hear a lot about is the transportation project and how people feel about it generally. And so that that I know you've been meeting about and that I knew that we would have questions about. So so that's where I'm moving and that is the question about the ten lanes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So we haven't actually had this discussion in this chambers before. And because we are now contributing money to a transportation project that as drafted has ten lanes, I think it's important that we have that conversation. So can you speak to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The justification? Well, first of all, actually, let's go back because there was a comment made by one of the speakers that I want to clarify when we had. And Diane Barrett, you may be the one to do this, because this was probably before Tony took over when we were going to do the replacement of the viaduct with'",
        "'speaker_4': 'a bump north. Was that an eight lane project or attending a project? I believe that was ten lanes as well. Okay. So so it sounds like that that addition of a lane was not new to the partially covered lower.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of our speakers thought that it was. Okay. So then back to Tony, then talk about please the reasoning in particular on the need for the additional lane.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when we look at a project and after all the years of disagreement and being stymied on a decision, the partially lowered culvert alternative is one that finally kind of made up for the sins of the past, actually got the community on board, that there was a way to reconnect the community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Now, I'll remind this council that this alternative is a couple hundred million dollars more expensive to provide this type of mitigation versus replacing it with another elevated structure. So when we start talking about costs for those mitigations, that's that's a conversation outside of this room that I have a lot of times explaining why we're spending that much'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more for this mitigation once we're into this trenching and building a lowered section, unlike a replacing a bridge with a bridge where if in future growth we have to add capacity. It's not as hard to do with adding extensions on piers and adding additional girder lines.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So we took an extra hard look at the traffic growth numbers provided by Dr. COG and had to make what is the most prudent and best use of sustainable decisions for the taxpayers of Colorado. And that is the ten lane template.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It is clearly identified in any of the alternatives. But once we get into this trenching situation, we cannot start smaller. There is no application of saying no. We'll take a smaller template and then a bigger bite later. This is what the growth projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'This is what we see from the Dr. COG model and we cannot build something that's not sustainable. Going back and correcting this is not a viable solution.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if I can ask about the Dr. COG model, because I was, you know, being one of Denver's reps to Dr. COG, I was part of a meeting where they went through the history. And so I just want to confirm that you are aware that the model that they are currently using is not the model that those'",
        "'speaker_4': 'that that that model was a prior model. That, that if we were to run the model today, it would be run with totally different technology than was used for that model. So you're aware of that and still feel like.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's the model you're going to rely on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'From the team of experts that we have on the project. That is the correct projection to be using as we move forward. Correct.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So has there been any conversations about proceeding with the project? Should I mean, should the. I don't even know if that's possible for the final environmental impact statement to say yes, partially covered, lower option, but not ten lanes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I mean, what is. Is that is that a conversation that we can pursue in terms of limiting the footprint of this project?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the answer for the Federal Highway Administration, who was the ultimate signature of the document? You clear the window that is needed once you after a record a decision. If there's ever any discussions on any modification that comes afterwards and you have to demonstrate viable cost benefit and valid reasons why you would build something less than what'",
        "'speaker_5': 'was ultimately cleared in the record of decision. But that is the process that's used that we've used on other projects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay, we won't see the road till next year.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I guess my next area of questioning is really a question about the mitigation. And so some of the members of the public were not here. When I kind of read you the riot act last time on first reading, this is one of those two reading agreements.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So they were here previously and stood up there. Can you commit now that you would amend this IGA to put in writing in contract with Denver other areas of mitigation that are agreed to in the future?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Should we kind of rephrase my last comment? I mean, this is an agreement. It's we can make tweaks and modifications if need be. But the binding contract that lasts for a long, long time is the record. A decision?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The record a decision will identify and indoctrinate those mitigations that are committed to. And so whoever is up here from seed out in the years ahead, phase two, whenever anything is completed, that is what binds the Department of Transportation and FAA CWA with the commitments made those that's that's what we've done on numerous other records of decisions'",
        "'speaker_5': 'that's the binding contract. This is an agreement.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can I ask a question for the city attorney who has standing to enforce the IGA as compared to who has standing to enforce a record of decision and in particular going to get really legal everyone's sorry our third party beneficiaries do they have standing in either of those in terms of or I'm asking the city where do'",
        "'speaker_4': 'we get to enforce or have standing to enforce? But then secondly, where would third party beneficiaries homes that were due mitigation improvements, communities that were do investments, things like that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With Sean Sullivan, the city attorney's office. With regard to the Iwga, the city and the state are the parties to the agreement, so they would be the parties who'd be able to enforce it. Specifically, we didn't allow for third party beneficiaries.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'With regard to the record of decision, that's not a contract per se. Well, Mr. DeVito, it's an enforceable document that requires the state and the federal government to.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Adhere to the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Mitigation that's required in that document. It's not a contract, per se, but it would be something that would be enforceable by other parties if if they weren't following it. And without going into a lot of detail, that's the best I'm going to give you tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'All right. Well, that's an area we need to continue, because I guess what I heard you say is I didn't actually hear you give an answer to whether you would amend the saiga in. My concern is that if there is a greater level of protection for the people of Denver to have you commit to the mitigation, even'",
        "'speaker_4': 'if it duplicates what's in the record of decision, if there may be a compelling legal reason why it's important for you to commit to those things in this type of agreement versus just having it in a record of decision.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to rely on an act of Congress to try to compel performance if I have an easier way to enforce. So. So what I'm getting at is I think I mean, the question people have had about is this it's not the last bite at the apple.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to know what the next bite of the apple looks like. And I want it to look like this. I want the next bite at the apple to be that, yes, we can enter into a contract between Denver and see that to clarify any remaining mitigations that get agreed to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That's the answer I'm looking for. I don't know what I'm going to get it, but that's what I'm looking for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Counsel. I would probably suggest that we would just write a new figure if there was things that developed as we went through here. I mean, what we're trying to do is identify the the key part of this is the drainage.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And to give a level of comfort to the bidders that CDOT and city and county of Denver are in partnership. You know, that's that's what's needed right now to move forward and not move prescriptive. In my 24 years as a civil servant, often to often see that and this is really what the the crest of this agreement'",
        "'speaker_5': 'is. And so if we had to come up with something else, the partnerships that have struck, we'd strike another idea.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So Diane and Leslie, if you can help explain to everyone here what the structure is for negotiating with the whole issue of I-70, because it can get a little bit confusing and there can appear that there's a lot of layers of bureaucracy, which is diminishes trust.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I know that both of you worked very, very hard and as did see that to come to this point and it's frustrating not to be able to communicate what the city has gained and how much support has moved in terms of trying to get to this intergovernmental agreement.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So what I would like for you to talk to me about is the internal structure of the city, and I want you to talk about that so that people can sort of be clear about how those decisions are made.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then if you have ideas about. How we how the city communicates, where you work, how you're doing on each of these mitigation things that are 1900 to 1000 different things, because we worked really hard to thread it all the way through from the neighborhood and issues that they had, the nonprofits, the churches worked with city council'",
        "'speaker_7': ', worked with the city of Denver, all these different layers to get on one page in terms of the the mitigation that you have in front of you. I know that's a lot, too, when we start all over.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No, please don't. Thank you, Councilwoman, I. I was hoping to have an opportunity to say, because people. Some people are stressing that the city's paying all this money. We are getting a lot.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are getting a lot, sweetheart.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Agree to build the cover.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Absolutely. And they will. And they have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Never faltered from that, not once. But they didn't agree to.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Make it what we want it to be. Brad.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I may ask Brad to come up if you guys have a if you feel like a few minutes to talk about urban design and to talk about the kinds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Of things like the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bookends that are so.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Important to the city, that's, you know, it can't it can't.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Be important to see that it's not what they do, but it is what we do. We build cities here. Brad, would you mind? Brad, you can talk just a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Little bit about the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Bookends and the things we're asking for on the cover.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening. Pat Buchanan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Executive director, community Planning and Development. And our team has been involved in some of the work helping the process with the design of the led the community process. And Steve Nally, who's been the rock star in front of you most of the evening, is here also and can give you more detail to that if you'd like.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But in terms of the lid, a couple of things we learned and really pushed hard for was from from visiting the lid in Dallas that is very similar in sort of how it can tie together to two parts of the city that were were affected by a historic highway alignment.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And what we noticed at that location was that the lids at either end ended with a street that crossed. And we know that one of the most important things that the lid does besides create activity on the lid is connect north and south, reconnect these historic neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And those connections happen as much or more at the streets. And what happens at the edges of those streets, not just the lid. And so what I'm saying is that if we end the lid with a street and don't complete that street on both sides of the street, east and west side of the street, we don't we'",
        "'speaker_0': 'weaken the actual strength of the connection, north and south. And so rather than having the lid end with the road, the bookends extend the lid so that we finish a complete street on each side of those streets, both East and West End, and to that to the tune of about 50 feet, I believe, on to the West'",
        "'speaker_0': '. And how much? 60 feet to the west and to the east ends of the lid. So those are the additional cars that we felt were really important to leverage the North-South connectivity. And I also would add that in terms of the slip ramps that are being talked about and the width and I agree that the width and'",
        "'speaker_0': 'every foot matters in this project, no doubt about it. But please also know that it isn't just the width of the cut itself. It is. It is the roads to the to both the north and south. And so those alignments, the the slip ramps actually allow the width, the whole the width of the overall assembly of the'",
        "'speaker_0': 'highway from north to south to be less. And that's because it allows a tighter diamond and steel vasquez interchange and allows us to create more developable area at the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast quadrants of that intersection. That's true from a purely planning perspective, why we felt that the slip ramps was such an important piece.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So again, not just where the where the retaining walls are, but actually if you look at the whole assembly of the East-West Highway.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Brad. And then I would like to say that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would also like to say.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Importance of the way we work with Scott and the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Way we have developed the relationship.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With Scott is great. Leslie Thomas and Gretchen Haller from the Department of Finance and I were primarily charged with this work of working with Scott. But in addition, all of our teams were behind us and with us. Kerry Kennedy was there every step of the way, looking at all the numbers working and all the numbers.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This has not been individual folks. It's been teams at the city working for the best interests of the city. Scott has agreed not just to work with us, but they've embedded Leslie and their technical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Review team for the bidders.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They've embedded me in the finance team looking at bidders and making those selections. This is almost unheard of for folks across the country, and this is cooperation that will benefit all of us tremendously as we go forward. So going forward, as Leslie told you about the new process or the process for the office, we will be looking'",
        "'speaker_7': '. When once the FDIC.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Comes out, one of the main things we'll be looking at is what they did and didn't do of the things we all asked for. And we'll have conversations and we'll have discussions and we'll have negotiations around that. And I'm looking forward to that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I'm looking forward to involving the new council in that. So does that help.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Councilwoman? Is it just me? Yes, it does. And the unfortunate thing, Karma, is that you guys are working so, so difficult. You're working so hard and lots of difficult situations and the neighborhood can't see it. And I just don't know how through this process there is some trust that's built and the realization that, you know, you're doing'",
        "'speaker_7': 'your best to do right by the neighborhood. So that's something that will be dealt with.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Ortega, you're up.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just wanted to ask Brad a question about the slip ramps. If you wouldn't mind coming back to the microphone. So manager of Public Works, Jose Cornejo, I guess that's executive director now. Manager had said that they looked at how to try to reduce the footprint and there was about eight feet of savings.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But when we look at adding in the slip ramps, you add in the ramp and the shoulder. So what does that come out to? I thought it was about 24 feet per ramp.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you're talking about everything inside the retaining walls?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, I'm talking just about the slip ramps.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Right. Which are inside the retaining walls. Correct. Right. And I'm talking about the impact, the opportunity that adding the slip ramps inside the retaining wall presents in terms of reducing the additional paved footprint north and south of the retaining walls at the Steel Vazquez interchange.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'What I'm trying to find out is how much more feat does it add to the footprint by putting in the slip ramps? Isn't that about 48 feet? Because it's about 24 feet per per lane. When you add in the shoulders.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I can't. You know.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So we save eight feet by trying to reduce the footprint. But we're we're actually adding almost 50 feet by putting those slip ramps in. This is what I got from an engineer. Okay, so.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm an artist, you know that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Just making up these numbers.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I don't have that answer. The reason we have been so supportive of the slip ramp option is that it produces many acres of developable area in the at the steel Vasquez interchange that we believe is really critically important connective tissue at that interchange and potentially could be as a location for a second load down down the road'",
        "'speaker_7': '. Okay. Thank you. I was just trying to get clarity on.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'An.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Actual footprint of the corridor through these neighborhoods. So the 300 foot wide swath. Would you just clarify that? That goes from Brighton to. Is that Quebec? Is that what's. What's the Eastern most?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'That's not cool. I don't know where the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Distance that that width of the corridor will carry. I know there were some additional things that were requested by Denver at I believe. Hallie Was that one of the interchanges? DIANE And then there was another one, I believe, at Quebec.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So that in the future we have the ability to add additional lanes at Quebec and Peoria. Peoria. Those are the two places where the bridges will be wide enough to accept a bigger Peoria and a bigger.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Quebec when that time is right. Money is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Available, okay? But that's not part of the $1.8 billion for now. The the the widening of Quebec and the widening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Of Peoria are not included. No, just the widening of the highway.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Thank you. I'm done with my question. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Bob.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Since some folks in the public have pointed out that I'm not going to be in office very long after I make this decision tonight, I just have to ask this question. And it's based on the fact that I heard from a constituent today, in fact, that part of the reason they're saying defer this'",
        "'speaker_6': 'decision to a future council is that we are spending quite a bit of money. We are. Looking at sizable budget budget commitments in in a number of these decisions we we heard about the North this talk show did night nation on western this year we put a lot of money into Brighton Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We've got the river itself project. We're talking about I-70 right now. If $10 million in infrastructure into the DIA development, we had a big presentation on Bettcher and the Performing Arts Center. So my question is for finance or for the administration?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'What's left for input from future council members? What can we do about the rest of the city? Will there be anything left? And how is this administration going to approach that question? Because they're going to ask it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm the only one that stood up. Okay. Well, there's a lot left, and there's a lot of innovation that's going to have to happen among your colleagues. Those of you who are still.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And work with administration and the agencies to make these things happen. But I'm I'm I've done Brad in tonight, so I won't ask him again. But Brad is in charge of Brad and others are in charge of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Three.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Massive planning projects right now, downtown, 16th Street Mall, The Better and the Arts Complex and the Convention Center.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I sort of included those in my list. We've already been briefed on those. I know those are coming. What else is left? Sun Valley isn't huge priority.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The mayor will be working with you on several projects having to do with Sun Valley related to Sun Valley. In the next few months we'll be working. And you did include the river projects. Those things.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'New.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Owners at the what we call.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Gates Broadway site. And that's enormous. And that's a big, big project that the new council will be working on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'My question is, will there be funding for all the CIP requests that come across generally throughout the city? I know there are a lot of things on the plate, but how are you going to make those decisions when we're obligating so many money, so much money, including those things you just mentioned?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A lot of things will not be.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'From capital budget of the city. A lot of things will have to be public private partnerships. And Gretchen can talk to you more about that and Gretchen will talk to you about several other things as well. Good evening.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Members of council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'm Gretchen Haller. I'm the city's deputy chief financial officer. I'm happy to have a chance at the microphone because the rest of the team had been up here the whole night.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So thank you for your.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Question for this specific iwga. We are very happy about the financing that's proposed behind it, namely because it's very difficult for the city to pay for $37 million worth of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Transportation enhancements.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In a single year. That is not the size of our annual CIP. So the fact that Seedat was willing to partner with us on a financing that is comparable to what the city would have been able to do in our own financing and take the upfront carrying costs of that financing through to the completion of the asset'",
        "'speaker_3': '. When it is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Available in 2022 really gives us the ability to ramp up and accommodate that $2.68 million payment beginning in 2022, so that it will.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Not have.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'A significant impact on our annual CIP. So we have the time to plan for that. We do not have the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Carrying costs for the finance.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We do not have capitalized interest in accommodating that cost. So that is something that we were pleased to be able to work with SEEDAT on for the wastewater costs. I would just add that we have a number of different funds in the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The city is is funded for capital improvements. That is a separate fund from our wastewater enterprise fund. So the cost of the drainage will be paid for through the Wastewater Enterprise Fund. As I did note on first reading of this project of this idea, the Budget Management Office is already planning on coming forward City Council.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As a part of our 2016 budget preparation, we have a need to request a rate increase for the wastewater fund. We had our last rate increase in 2011 and in the meantime we've had increasing capital costs. So we need that rate increase for the long term sustainability of the fund.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In addition, we in addition, we have a need for.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'An enhanced water quality program. And what works well in this case.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Is that the Montclair Basin, which is included in the combined drainage project, is being.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Proposed not as a typical.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pipe under the ground. It's being proposed as a wonderful and big water quality project that really supports the work we need for the Platte River. So in addition to the other projects or recognizing the other projects that Diane mentioned, we will continue to look for ways to creatively finance them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You'll notice that with the National Western Center we're looking to lodgers. Tax Carry had talked about that, but that is asking the voters to approve the extension of lodgers tax that's paid for by visitors for a visitor facility.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's the kind of access we look to in all of our financing. We'll continue to look for creative approaches like that and all the while be very cognizant of the city's triple-A rating and maintaining that as well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Thank you. I that was an excellent answer in explaining why this is a good financing plan for this project. I will just say now that we don't have to bring in during comments that we're still not talking about spreading improvements equitably.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We're committing the CIP for any number of years on the 2.68, spreading these equitably around the city, those areas that really need improvement, those areas that really contribute to the well and a good part of the capital of this city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I'm not hearing that answer tonight, Sky.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Sure. Sky, start from the mayor's office.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's an excellent point, Councilman Robb.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You've made it a couple of times and just want to put on record here. I think you and I have discussed.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It, that equity around the city is a really important value and it's something we're looking towards in all of these.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Projects. We actually have a subcommittee of the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Group talking about some of the projects. You talked about the downtown projects that will focus on making sure that we are looking.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Equitably across the city for other issues.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And one thing that Gretchen didn't mention mentioned, but I know.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She would be happy to add to if I get anything wrong, is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We've been very, very careful to also preserve our geo capacity, our general obligation bond capacity. And that's something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We're going to have to undertake in the next few years to determine what those.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Projects are.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that will have to be an equitable conversation across the city of where needs are and where we prioritize them, not just in this area, but everywhere.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. Because I do want our successors to be successful in bringing forward their priorities. Yeah. Thank you, Sky.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's an excellent point.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Robb, Councilwoman Monte.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. I have a question for Brian. Are you still here, Pinkerton? My question is about 47th in York, which is a huge safety issue, as you are aware. Can you tell me if that the idea where we are with with 47th in New York and if the city through negotiations, try to see if that would pay'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for those improvements.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Brian Pinkerton with Public Works. For a long time, the community has voiced the priority of the 47th in York, and we in public works in the city have agreed that that is a critical crossing that needs to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We worked extensively with the seed art team to look at if there might be some way to incorporate some aspect of the I-70 project to include an improved crossing at 47th and York. Ultimately, what was a decided or agreed upon between the entities was that this was a city responsibility to deal with this crossing and that there'",
        "'speaker_5': 'might be certain aspects of the project depending on. As the ultimate design proceeded on I-70, there may be certain aspects that would help make an improvement at the crossing easier to accomplish, but that it really fell on the city shoulders to deal with this because it wasn't an interregional type of mobility challenge.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It was really a challenge for the communities in the area. And so the city has allocated, I believe, $200,000 in this calendar year to begin a study to look at what the options are to make an improvement in that area.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There's more funding following in 2016, and we are going to be commencing that study very shortly.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'May I ask one more question? And then the issue related to truck traffic and the rerouting of trucks during construction? Me, I don't know if that wants to answer that, but also if the trucks are going to be rerouted during construction, shouldn't they just always be rerouted out of the neighborhood as well?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Tony, do you want to answer?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Tony DeVito. See that assembly project director. So with regard to truck during trucks, during construction, we will do construction specifications, especially to avoid staging areas in the neighborhood to be sure that the traffic methods that are proposed by the developer keep sacred that community.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Be sure that the the phasing of the construction doesn't induce traffic in there. Those will be part of the specifications. So during construction will definitely be working with that. When the project is ultimately done. It goes back to being an interstate with a relocated 46th Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so then again, interstate. So we're going to be back to having the truck traffic.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So was that one thing that the neighborhood can continue to give input on? Or is that part a done deal?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You know, it really comes down to our federal highway administration making that ultimate call. And once you're building an interstate to its ultimate template and it's safe, it is important to maintain that truck connectivity. There is if you look at the stretch of the corridor, it's not only a community, it's it's 1100 businesses that rely on that'",
        "'speaker_5': 'commerce and that that movement of commerce and goods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just want to know what my response to that is, that it's very, very important to the neighborhood that trucks be rerouted out of their neighborhoods. And every effort to see that in the city of Denver can make it so that they don't need to deal with that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I would really appreciate that on every level that you can do that and the neighborhood continues to talk about that. But we continue to sort of stay in the same place. And I know that it's it's a huge impact to them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I just want to reiterate that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Monteiro, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I just want to piggyback on this and highlight that although the truck traffic is only 10% of the traffic that drives on this corridor. It's 50% of the pollution that is sort of left in the neighborhood as those vehicles drive through.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So addressing the health impact to the neighborhood is a critical part. And when you look at the end of the day, how wide this is going to be and how much more traffic is going to travel on this corridor.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And in granted, the, you know, the preferred alternative that takes the traffic below grade is less impactful. Not all areas of the neighborhood are going to be where the wind is at. So it's why trying to move that truck traffic early and why it was important for the highway system to be looked at as a whole in'",
        "'speaker_7': 'this quadrant as opposed to just the I-70 corridor. It didn't really factor in traffic that should be routed on to 270 or 225 that are not doing local deliveries. And I think that's the most critical part. If people are not doing local deliveries and they don't need to be on I-70, they should be encouraged to be routed'",
        "'speaker_7': 'down one of those two corridors. Thank you and.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Any other questions? Seen none. Public hearing is now closed. Time for comments. Councilwoman Montero.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. As always, everything in global hilarious once a year is never easy. And and there. And no one is ever, ever, ever satisfied. I just want to reassure folks that think that this is not a highway to go out, that I have done my very best to push and push and'",
        "'speaker_7': 'push and push. And for a neighborhood that felt that they never had any attention by anyone before to shift from. We have more attention than we've ever had before and now we don't have time to even form. A neighborhood group is just amazing to me for, for example, to work on our housing and I'll get to my'",
        "'speaker_7': 'comments, but to work on a housing committee and then have someone from the neighborhood say, gosh, you know, that wasn't the right thing to do. There should have been a public hearing. You should have done this and that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to assure everybody that we are doing the best that we can. And I by no means feel like I'm going out on a low note. I've done my best, best, best work to the best capacity that I have to push for Globeville, various ones here.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'There's a lot of bureaucracy. There's a lot of layers. There's a lot of work. There's a lot of heavy lifting. But I want to tell the people in the neighborhood from Globeville earlier use once a year that if I believed that anyone was being dishonest, devious, whatever, all the ugly words that were said tonight, I would be'",
        "'speaker_7': 'the first one to say that, and I do not believe that. We've been working on it for so, so long. And with the support of Mayor Hancock all the way going back to even doing trying to figure out how do we get a tsunami of resources into this neighborhood, how do we turn all of these decisions that'",
        "'speaker_7': 'we did not make? How do we turn them around and try to get as many resources into Globeville, Elyria, Swansea? How do we try to make right the wrongs that we did not do? But we're here today and we're trying to move forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I want to tell everybody here and you can follow me out to my car and you can argue with me all day long. But I tell you, I have never felt that the people from the city and county of Denver have been operating from any devious perspective, anything other than trying to honor what we've been trying'",
        "'speaker_7': 'to tell the neighbor with what the neighborhood has been trying to tell us. There are so many things coming in the direction of Globeville, hilarious ones here, and they're confusing and they're overwhelming. And it's more than any neighborhood that I know in the city could possibly deal with.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you can deal with it. And you have been and now your voices are heard and now you're empowered. And what I ask is for and what I ask is for the city and county of Denver and see that in whatever way they can.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't know how to work this miracle. I have no idea how to work this miracle. But the idea of building trust is so important. It may never be built. It was destroyed a long time ago. Do you stop trying?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Do you spin out and say, wait till the next council, let them do it? Right. Who's to say that it'll be any better? What if it sets everybody back? What happened? Where. Where did. Where all of a sudden?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because there was an election held on May 5th, that all of a sudden we've lost our intelligence and we can't make decisions anymore. I am not going to kick the can down the road. I know with all my heart, all of the work that's been done by everyone in this room, nobody has stopped.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No one has gone this way and said, I can't do it. Oh, my God, the sky is falling. Everybody is pressing forward. And so tonight, I'm going to press forward to and I'm telling whoever is telling me, wait till the next council, because, you know, there are new hope.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I can't do that. I was elected to take care of business. And tonight I am supporting this. And all I ask again is the miracle that somehow all of the entities, city and county of Denver C dot and everybody else comes into this neighborhood, that there is an effort by leadership, neighborhood leadership, political leadership, that somehow we'",
        "'speaker_7': 'begin to build those bridges of trust. Because I will tell you, in this neighborhood, if you don't keep your word, you might as well not even go around writing anymore. You have to keep your word the same way.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The neighborhood needs to keep their word to the city. And I've been in situations where people tell me I support that. I support that. And all of a sudden I'm in a public meeting and all of a sudden somebody has amnesia.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I don't remember ever supporting that. We I have followed the lead of the neighborhood. I truly believe that I have. And I want to say that I am going out on a high note. And I know that I've brought everything.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I have brought my best and brightest game to this situation. So I'm supporting this, and I hope that my colleagues will do the same.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank the speakers who stayed late tonight. And I will be supporting the project. And I want to talk about why and why. I also believe that it's important that the vote happen tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'One of the things that I think the community is asking in the testimony is about whether or not we can both be partners and cooperators as well as advocates. And I think that that's an important question. So we've described and we've lauded the city staff for cooperating with that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I think the part that Councilwoman Monteiro mentioned that folks cannot see is the places at which you are acting as an advocate, which means pushing, shoving, challenging and demanding things on behalf of the voices that are here.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So that's the challenge, right? Your public face that you have presented is one where you are cooperating and there has been no visibility to the places we are pushing, shoving, challenging and advocating. And so but I think that in part that's the role we're playing up here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that is the role that I think that I hope folks can see that you have in this council. Advocates, you know, and I think you have them in the staff, too. It's just that they do it in the negotiating room and we're doing it from the dais.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We have the privilege of doing it publicly in a way that they don't. But it is possible to both be your advocates and challenge and push for further improvements and find areas of common ground. I think those can both exist.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so, you know, that's my commitment to you. So the two pieces that I believe we have done our due diligence anyway, and I really do take exception to the idea that we have not vetted this agreement. I personally have probably spent, I don't know, ten or 12 hours now between the committee meeting and reading and asking'",
        "'speaker_4': 'questions in between. Others, I'm sure have spent similar amounts of time these agreements, just to be very clear. We've been we've been asking questions for over, what, about 90 minutes now since the public hearing testimony ended. This agreement is vetted.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So the advocating for the future is about two things. One, missed opportunity. We did not have a public meeting where we said to people, we are going to talk about drainage, please come and learn about drainage. We should have done that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We didn't do it. We need to do it going forward. This is a major improvement and it's going to have an impact on as many properties potentially as the I-70 project itself. It is a worthy project. It's a good project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'People might have felt that more if they understood it and knew more about it. Missed opportunity. Now we have. Ketchup work to do. So I am an advocate. I will advocate and push that that planning process occurs in an intentional, visible way going forward on the drainage project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Secondly, mitigation, I think you heard many of us asking, demanding, pushing on mitigation. That is an area where I also expect our staff to be advocating for that as well. I expect you to go in a room and ask for things that are not offered and to push for things that the you know, I forget what's the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'thing before the record of decision, the thing that comes before that if it's not in there, we're going to ask for it anyway and you need to be asking for it. You, as our representatives need to be asking for it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So those expectations are high, but in a similar way. I also have to be honest, right? I have to be honest about the limitations that we all operate under. So, for example, what would materially be different 45 days from now with a record of decision be done?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No. Would we, for example, have a significantly different sense of what the mitigation factors to come out in the record of decision are? No. So when will we know those things? We won't know them till the record decision comes out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. So there's no material difference. There will be no new information today versus 45 days from now. It's simply a request or a lack of trust that we're doing enough vetting. I submit to you that you have advocates, and I submit to you that there's vetting occurring.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So a 45 day makes no material difference. If we were to delay it until the record decision came out, though, there would be a material difference, which is we would be six months behind on the drainage project. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that matters. So that is why proceeding now matters. One of the things that I'm concerned about is folk, folk saying that the agreement is vague. Here's an example. So let's move off drainage. Right. Drainage needs to occur even if I-70 doesn't happen.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So I'm glad we've leveraged that money to make it better. And I did review last time, for those who may not have viewed the agreement, has a clear provision that if the record of decision does not decide on this project, that we can go ahead and renegotiate and terminate the agreement we would have to have, but we'",
        "'speaker_4': 'would have started the drainage project at least so we could continue the drainage project. We may have to scale it down, we may have to change it, but we will have started it. Drainage will be happening, but there are separate pieces, agreement, and I appreciate those who've separated it, which is money into the project.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Here's a point of the agreement that is not vague. We do not pay a penny for the transportation project actually until it's completed, not even just before it's approved. But we don't actually start paying till it's completed. So there is not a risk.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We are not taking any risk, right. By making this agreement now versus making it after the record decision occurs. The thing that we allow, the one material thing that matters and the reason why I am going to vote for this tonight is it allows us to start the drainage project that is needed.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now. We leverage that money and we leverage urban drainage money immediately. And I wish I wish that that project had been better explained. I wish it had been noticed as its own topic and that we can do some catch up.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But that's I can't not proceed with flood protection we know we need because we didn't talk about it well enough. There are places where we missed legal notice and I have voted against things where we had a legal notice obligation and we missed it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I've said, you know what? We didn't follow the law. We can't do it. That's not the case here. We just didn't get our best, you know? And so but the benefits outweigh the costs. So that's where I'm at.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I know that we have a lot of work left to do, but I submit to you that a delay in the short term would make no material difference, and a delay in the long term would make a significant negative material difference.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It's critical that we proceed with improvements. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman and each Councilman Levitt.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I did have something to say, but I don't think any syllable I could utter could add any more detailed reasoning than Councilwoman Kennish has already articulated or any more powerful meaning than Councilwoman Monteiro.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Has already articulated.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I am done for the night.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Never. Councilman, can you top that?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Great. You make me look like the jerk. Speaking of drainage, I just want to go home and go. Oh, I am. And in addition to being a councilman, I have the privilege to be the chair of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I've done that for about a year and a half. Right, Dave? And all they do is talk about flood prevention, flood prevention, flood prevention and flood prevention. And before a couple of years ago, it was just a nice lunch to hang out with other folks from other counties around because we never had floods.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We had droughts until a few years ago. And what we were told is that if the events that happened in Boulder and the events that happened in Aurora, which was worse than Boulder happened here, you would have a Katrina style.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Disaster. And then how much do you think we'd be paying?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'How much?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How expensive do you think that would be? 300 million. How horrible would it be to have to bury people in our city? Huh? I visited the Ninth Ward in New Orleans. Those levees were broken because they didn't get invested in.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We didn't invest in them. And they're broken there in disrepair. And it's horrible. It's a failure of government. And their basic principle is to protect life and property, the most basic principle of governance. Now, I go a little bit beyond because I'm a liberal, but I'll just say this I am convinced that if we don't do anything'",
        "'speaker_5': 'about it, we're going to be visiting that scenario sometime in the near future. I haven't seen rain like this either, sir. I have it. And most of that flooding from the planet comes from upstream. Imagine if it hits in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Denver proper, we're in trouble and there is no home in this city that is out of a floodplain that is not going to be impacted by a flood. I guarantee you, even in the highest hill. Right. Here's the thing.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We did miss an opportunity. We did miss an opportunity to talk to the public about drainage and flood control and why this why this is important. And for the record, I don't know about you all, but whether it comes from the state, the feds or the city, taxes are taxes and they suck, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'You see them come out of your check. You see them come out of your property taxes. I hate getting taxed. I'm not flipping. Philosophy, sir, I do believe that necessary. These are one of those projects that are necessary, right?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Absolutely. And, you know, we had done it a little. Could we have done it a little better? Absolutely. But it pays off in the end. It's an investment and it's investment that community. Now, there's two things wrong. Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The flooding, the potential flood. And to that highway. I was part of the yellow shirt brigade four years ago. In oh three, we were going door to door, 8000, 8000 households. And I knocked on plenty of those doors and all those council districts in every neighborhood, from Globeville to Bella, the Green Valley Ranch.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And we talked about I-70. That's why I was for the reroute. The second alternative, I mean and guess what? It's not going to happen, right? And I'm not going to go picking out old wounds. Got to move on.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's not going to happen. So the best other alternative, what I heard on the doors was to bury it. I said, Can you make it at least look like Sixth Avenue? I hate that. Well, I love it. I love Sixth Avenue.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I love Sixth Avenue. But I hated Sixth Avenue. Now, do we should we talk about a cover over sixth? That would be awesome if we could successfully do it here. Absolutely. But at the end of the day.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a catalytic project. This is a project.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That we should be focused on and how to leverage those dollars and that investment back into the neighborhoods, jobs, business opportunities. I don't know about that any part of the city, but in my part of the city, there's a lot of construction workers and we've hit we visited the site and three, we buried three, four, three.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Three of the workers we talked to were straight up from the neighborhood, recent hires. We got a push for that kind of stuff. That's what turns it around. Now I'm supporting this. Not that my colleagues don't have valid points and they have a valid get us complaints.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I think there are like I said, I think we could have done better on the public education side. But that's what we learned from right at the end of the day. That doesn't Trump not doing anything at this site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm supportive. No, I'm all for it. Thank you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I'll try to be brief. First of all, I want to thank all of the state and city staff people who have participated in the many, many meetings that we've had with members of city council to ensure that we're, you know, engaged in the process with you.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I want to thank the residents for their input and for coming out tonight. And the drainage project is absolutely critical. You know, when it rained last week, I went and drove around to see where we had flooding. And it flooded down on Washington Street and it flooded on 46th Avenue, as it has when we get bad rains'",
        "'speaker_7': 'year after year. I saw some of the neighborhoods in Councilman Brooks district where where the water was very, very high. This is a critical project for these neighborhoods. I'm struggling with the fact that we have we have mixed all of this together and we still don't have the final year, which has been delayed and delayed and delayed'",
        "'speaker_7': '. And I think it's in part because of the dialog that's going on back and forth between Denver and Scott, not trying to work through some of these issues, but to not know that we in fact will have mitigation clearly identified and that those things will be in that final year and that they will follow into the record'",
        "'speaker_7': 'of decision is is hard for me to to just trust that they're going to be there. And it's not that I don't trust the people. I think we've got great people who are engaged in this process from CEDA and from the city.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I'm looking at history of what's occurred in these neighborhoods and and how there have been promises made. I remember when the widening through Globeville took place in the neighbors were promised that there was going to be beautiful artwork along the wall underneath I-70.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I think one panel got done. And as I continued to ask about that, what I heard was we ran out of money. And I don't want to see that happen with these neighborhoods. These people have paid the price with their lives because of the kind of exposure they've had to the particulate matter.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's why doing the air monitoring before, during and after construction is important to know what kind of health impact will you know folks will be exposed to. I want to know that the doors and windows for people that live within 500 feet of the highway are going to be taken care of.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And that it's not just, you know, a portable. Air conditioning system that people are going to get in their homes. The impact to the lungs of small children from all the air quality studies that we have seen that have been published.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'All you have to do is Google that and you'll see that anybody who lives within 500 feet, the particulate matter, especially the ultrafine, is most deadly to small children. And it's why pushing for these things is critical to ensure that we're not compromising the health of people in most neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I I'm not there yet. I appreciate all the work that's been done in getting us to this point, in trying to move this drainage project forward, which, again, I think is vital to these neighborhoods. But to to just say, you know, we'll keep working on these things.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In my mind, there's no reason why those mitigation issues couldn't have been part of this agreement. And what that says to me is where we haven't gotten there and in anything that's not in the final is in the record of decision is not going to be funded.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And so to to know that those things aren't part of this agreement are are disturbing and concerning. So I unfortunately, am not going to be able to vote for this tonight. As much as I want to support the drainage project, I wish it could have been separated out because I wholeheartedly support the need for addressing that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I think you've got the votes here tonight for it to pass. I just. I'm just not there. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Brooks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And first, you know, I want to thank everybody for being here and especially folks from Greece who stayed the entire time to stay here. You know, folks who get here at 530, I don't know how you still have your cars.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'There are people sitting up watching this tonight that cannot make it here because they were stuck in those storms over the last couple of months.

        "'speaker_0': 'We cannot do projects of this size unless they're leveraged. I mean, that's the complication of this idea and this deal. And I know that there's a lot of mistrust. And we you know, I think Councilman Monteiro put it really well that there's a lot of mistrust, but we have to believe that we've got to come together in'",
