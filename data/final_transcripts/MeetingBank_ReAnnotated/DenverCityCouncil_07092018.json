And in fact, this second round, this expansion doesn't even go through the exercise of of having an outside investors loan money that we then repay with with imputed theoretical savings in city in city spending.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I think it is premature to go into an expansion of this of this housing first program when I don't believe we have adequately analyzed the social impacts that are occurring under the initial rollout, as I've explained in committee, and for the members who weren't there and for the audience, the project, the site based project that is in'",
        "'speaker_9': 'my district has has had a very harsh ripple effect in the community. And I don't believe that the theory of repaying the investors who loaned us the money for the wraparound services for the the chronic and high frequency.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Not my term, but the term of the folks who proposed it. The worst of the worst. Homeless who get arrested the most. Who go to detox the most. Go to Denver General Emergency Room. Denver health. Excuse me. Emergency room the most.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That we're not capturing all of the new costs because Denver police units from police district four are called to that building two, three, four times a day. And it's having significant impacts on the surrounding businesses. The very first week that tenants moved in, one of the very first tenants went up to the liquor store and committed a'",
        "'speaker_9': 'a theft. And the police received no cooperation from the operator of the facility. I do have to credit, though, mental health center of Denver, which operates the facility, because because of these problems, they have made the very adjustments that the community asks them to do and a good neighbor agreement, but which was not included.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They are, in fact, restricting overnight visitors who have caused significant problems being led in the back door. They have, in fact, done evictions of folks, which is something the community wanted one of them to commit to in the first place, and they would not.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I do want to credit them for having the flexibility to adjust and to try to mitigate the the harmful I call them anti-social impacts that this program is having. So while I believe that this contract with Colorado Coalition for the Homeless is an improvement because it's not site based, it is more it's tenant based.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So it's going to be scattered site the way it was explained to us in committee. I believe that's an improvement. I wish that had been the case up front. I think that we should not jump into this expansion until we fully understand the the how to mitigate some of the negative impacts that it does cause.'",

But because I think I was somewhat unprepared for some of the concerns you shared in committee, I didn't want us to to close this discussion out without some some comment.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that Councilman Flynn has raised several different issues. One is the model of supportive housing, where individuals are living together with similar challenges. And I think that that is a model that I think we as a community, I'm realizing as we go through some discussions in the zoning task force that Councilwoman Ortega and I are'",
        "'speaker_10': 'on, I think we started with discussions about projects and locations and contracts, and we didn't really, as a community, pause and talk about that model. Overall, there is some value to having folks receiving services together. The idea of having a.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Social worker travel from site to site has has some cost impacts to it. It has some impacts for isolation for the individual who's going through an experience and doesn't have a community of of similar folks. And so I don't think it's the case that we can just say, oh, well, it's you know, it doesn't work to have'",
        "'speaker_10': 'folks living together because there are some important efficiencies from the government funding side and there's some important community benefits for those who are living and going through the process together. And and so in spite of, you know, some of the questions that individuals may have about this supportive housing, I think we need to slow down and talk'",
        "'speaker_10': 'about this. And so one of the things I'm volunteering to do is doing some research into some community conversations that are added. Let's not talk about it at a site specific or a contract specific level. Let's talk about the model and help folks answer some of the questions that probably your residents went through in the process of'",
        "'speaker_10': 'a site discussion but didn't have the chance to engage with. And so so stay tuned for that. You know, the second aspect here is, is how how the this this housing approach can integrate with communities and have a good dialog and respond to questions that come up.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'You know, I think it's a good thing. One of the things we say to folks is it's important. You know, I did some follow up research to to ask about the police calls. Many of them are about folks harassing residents, not so much about residents.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So those calls are not all calls against the residents. Many of them are calls by residents because they're at risk from someone from the outside. And so that's that's what we want folks to do. We want them to feel safe.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that the question about a call to police for prevention versus what we may have had when folks are unhoused, which is them being victimized and not being able to call the police because they had no phone or because they weren't able to get somewhere safe before they were, you know, victimized.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I think that there is still a comparative case we have to make about the fact that communities are impacted by people living on the streets. Certainly, you know, many of us get the calls about what's happening in alleys, what's happening in parks and what's happening in rivers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so there is an impact when people are not housed that impacts community as well. And so I just think it's important to have that conversation. And then the last concern that Councilman Flynn has raised is, is how we're paying.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think that what what I have seen in the data from the Urban Institute. So just to be clear, there is significant data. We have a year of data and an independent evaluator who has found that the majority of individuals have stayed house, have reduced their journeys, have reduced their hospital nights.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so a call to police is not the same cost, right? It calls the police because you're a victim of domestic violence is not the same cost as you being in a jail bed overnight. Right. So one is a protective preventative call, the other is a cost in the jail system.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so I believe the data is there that this is a cost benefit still to the city once you dig into the full cost of each of these these things that have been raised. And so I encourage folks to read the Urban Institute data, and I do think there is sufficient data for this expansion, although I acknowledge'",
        "'speaker_10': 'the fact that I think we need to have some more conversation about the model and help folks go through it more slowly so they can really ask questions. And in particular, our neighborhoods. I think they haven't been engaged as much in the conversation, perhaps, as we as policymakers.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So so I will, you know, see how I can help with that. I'm sure others are interested as well. I'll include our departments, but but for tonight, I'm really pleased to be advancing this contract because I think it is the right direction.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's not an easy direction, but it is the right direction. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I have to agree it is the right direction, but I am still going to just chiming in to explain another decision to to not say no, but to abstain from this vote, primarily because I did say no to the original SB, you know, in part because I thought it was the $4 million that we were essentially gambling'",
        "'speaker_5': 'on this being successful could have and should have gone directly into the project, maybe could have addressed some of this, this stuff sort of more real time. And this this contract is better than that. What we had done previously in a number of ways, but it is still has some of the concerns that I that I had'",
        "'speaker_5': 'originally on the incentive side. And so so while it is a step in the right direction, it is not not the complete step that I would like to have it in order for me to fully support it. And so I will be abstaining because it is an improvement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But it is not it's it's not there yet.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you, Mr. President. So, first of all, I appreciate Councilman Flynn pulling. He's too out. He and I were both really vocal about wanting to make sure that when this particular location was identified in his district, not this bill, but the site that he was referring to in southwest Denver, we advocated that the people who were homeless'",
        "'speaker_6': 'that live right next to the creek be allowed to be prioritized because the concern was if they didn't get a chance to be housed in this development, they potentially would be some of the people hanging out outside who some of the complaints are about, not just the some of the complaints about clients who live there, but some'",
        "'speaker_6': 'of the people that are still homeless that did not get to be prioritized. And I think that's a policy discussion that we need to have as well, because wherever we have these locations being selected, that that we don't get to weigh in on.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is important to look at what the communities are going to have to be dealing with. And in this case, Councilman Flynn and I were at a community event two weeks ago, and this was a huge topic of conversation.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So we do have to have that conversation. Management of these facilities is absolutely key in addressing the issues that are brought to their attention and having the community committees. I don't remember what you referred to it as, but.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It's it's important to have that ongoing dialog to be able to address the issues as they come up rather than waiting for them to fester and, you know, have more animosity within the community, between the community and the facilities.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I know District four does a really good job of working with the community. The manager, I understand, of Sanderson has has been very responsive in meeting with some of the adjacent businesses and the neighborhood group, and I think they're moving to be a better neighbor in the community.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'The Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, who this particular contract is with, has been the first organization in this city to do the Housing First model, and they've been doing it now for well over eight years and have done a really good job.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'They include the wraparound services on site and it it makes a difference for the individual because they're getting the services they need where they're at, rather than having to send them offsite to other places where it's sometimes a little more challenging.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And so I think these two bills tonight should move forward. But I agree with Councilwoman Kimmich that we need to continue this conversation about some of the key policy issues that are being discussed. You know, we. Purchased a building in southwest Denver in Councilman Clark's district that for whatever reason, did not work out.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'We then looked at the site in Councilman Lopez's district, and it's my understanding that's on hold. I don't know if the city is still looking to go into that site, but. We know our neighborhoods, so we should be part of the discussions so that decisions aren't being made where we then turn around later and you know, we're'",
        "'speaker_6': 'trying to figure out are we going to sell this building, are we going to put something else in the building that we purchased in in Councilman Clark's district? Because it did not work out as the site for utilizing social impact bonds and placing some of the individuals who are chronically homeless in our city.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'It is important that we have these these services and resources available for folks in our community that are struggling to get on their own, on their feet, on their own. So I will be supporting these two bills tonight.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, you back up.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'There just briefly, Mr. Perez. And I want to thank Councilwoman Kenny for her comments. And it reminded me that I need to point out that last year my office organized a new registered neighborhood organization to represent the Marly and Brentwood and Sharon Park neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And they have been very, very active in adopting that good neighbor agreement. And they have had mental health center of Denver come in and give a presentation, the manager of the project, and there's some very good dialog going on.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So since the Councilwoman mentioned engagement with the community, I wanted to mention the fact that Marley neighborhood now has a brand new and active neighborhood organization that is taking this by the horns and is getting very involved in it.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I think we'll address some of those issues that the councilwoman brought up.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you. You know, I think there's been a lot of conversation and I think it's been a good conversation. And I appreciate I appreciate it. You know, having the conversation around neighborhoods and count the councilwoman and each bringing up the national data, I think that's that's really important to know that Housing First is a is a best'",
        "'speaker_0': 'practice. I'm just going to give you some anecdotal data. Two of these sites are in my district. And I got to tell you that there one of the sites had opposition to it. And the other site, there is some neighborhood concern, but not opposition.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And the two sites that I'm mentioning is 20, 20, 77, Broadway and 40th in Colorado. And in both cases I've received, this is outside. And then I'm gonna go inside from the neighborhoods. You know, the amazement at how this is actually cleaned up the blocks on those neighborhood, how the blocks are much more active, and they're not'",

And then I met with a group of of color coalition folks who live in the St Francis that I said was, it's not Saint Francis across the street from the new development, but it's it is not a part of this package.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'that I've ever seen. And so I am 100% behind this program. I think we need to expand this program because I do believe, number one, that wraparound services and I do believe especially making sure that we are making that connection with those individuals who are incarcerated and not and do not have a home and do not have'",
        "'speaker_0': 'those services to go in making sure we're making that connection. So I'm so supportive of this and I'll be supportive of it going forward. And I think it's important that as we're thinking about this citywide and going to different neighborhoods, that we live in it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We live in a city. This is not the suburbs. We live in a city of different perspectives, different cultures, different economic backgrounds. We can no longer fight these things. We have to figure out how to live in a neighborhood where we all come together and figure out how all folks can live.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'to happen. And while I support the creation of this district. I will employ the folks that are organizing this thing in our part of this thing to make sure that whatever you're doing out there with the comes of housing, which we need to know, is it affordable or is it price where regular folks can't afford it?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'It on my watch? Is am I on this? How much money do you have to be in this? How much money you go excluded in this as you go about all this development and raising new taxes and all of that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Where do we fit in at that? Do we fit in where it comes to getting contracts to do this thing? Are we going to even be allowed to hold a sign? I'm talking about black people. Because when I go to all these metropolitan digs, you see all this construction stuff.'",

        "'speaker_6': 'I have a couple of questions. The first one is for Andrew, if you would mind, coming forward. Does the city have a policy on the size of a metro district? So somebody came in with one acre. Would we?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Improvement district. Is there a limit on the size?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We do have a criteria that we set out back in 2004 when we had a lots of green space. It was shortly after. If you think about all the land around Panya Boulevard that was annexed and we did have a criteria of about 160 acres was the size that we chose that we would do nothing smaller than'",
        "'speaker_1': '160 acres. But as all the large plazas have been filled up, we have routinely looked at smaller and smaller infill sites for metropolitan districts to be utilized.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So do we have a limit on the on the lower end?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If it if it makes sense that it's fulfilling, we look at it more holistically and look to it to like do the visioning. But no, we don't have a girlfriend.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And I don't know if you're the one that should answer the next question. So I heard that they're looking to do a grocery. But what what else is intended to be included within this development besides grocery stores?'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Is that intended to take up the majority of the five acres, 5.39 acres.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So Robert Koonce with the development entity. And so this will be a mixed use block with multi stories.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Primarily retail and restaurants on the ground floor and offices and other commercial uses on the upper two and three stories.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And there is no housing.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And there's no housing on this block.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. Do does the developer propose to use tax increment financing? Is that something that you're looking at down the road or.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So this is a site that's in the Lowry redevelopment area. So it is in the Lowry tax increment finance area already. It is already in a tax increment area. So there is tax increment money that has been used to help get the site ready.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So that's already been utilized?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. But the tax increment finance area has expired. And so all the original taxing revenues are returning now to the original taxing entities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Great. Thank you. I have no further questions.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the 25 year period for new projects is it is no longer possible to introduce a new project.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So the new projects. When the Lowry Redevelopment Project was originally a vision, there were a lot of projects that were brought forward. That list of projects has been completed and there are the tax increment finance area has been closed and so there are no more.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I was retired early ahead of schedule.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I'm sure this you've already talked about this in in committee and I'm sorry to go over this, but I'm looking at this. And aside from sort of one little segment of of underground sewer, it looks like pretty much all the infrastructure is there in the surrounding streets and the grid has been laid out and whatnot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And it seems like the improvements are largely focused on on private property, you know? You know, we had just gotten done talking about the stadium and I expect a parking structure to be in the stadium because that's a function that the that we've already put public investment into.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What is what's the impetus here? What is what makes this block different than any other private block in this city that requires there?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'That's I mean, that's a good question. And when you look at the Lowry redevelopment as a whole, it's that's how you got to look at the tax increment on this one, because it was an old Air Force base and then it was it by the utilization of the tax increment financing tool, we used the incremental property taxes'",
        "'speaker_1': 'to help redo replan, plan this, revision it and actually implement certain pieces of public infrastructure to bring that vision to fruition, whether it be some of the parks or the roads to actually get that was the use of the tax increment.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'If there was, there is $3.5 million of tax increment going towards this particular project and it is to help create the parking, which is is part of the support for the library because the library doesn't have enough parking right now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So when you look at like all the visioning and all the things that are going on across. LOWRY This is just that final piece of it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there is going to be a shared parking arrangement with the library across the street.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'You're welcome. All right. Thank you for those questions. Members of council. This concludes the public hearing for 570 comments of members of council and some assessment.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This is so it's so interesting to me because it's one of the last of a very long project. I started on the Lowry Project in 1992, two years before the airbase closed. And if you can imagine, you know, thousands of acres and more in the middle of the city and what a hubbub it caused at the time'",
        "'speaker_2': '. And this was an area, the boulevard, one that we didn't even expect to have the Air Force surplus. And so it came at the very end. It was the Finance Center. This particular plan for the Project for Boulevard One was done with a large committee of of residents of Lowry and neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it was well discussed. And certainly the part about having a commercial area that was across the street from the Lowry Town Center was important to the design. And, um, and here we are with a metropolitan district, and certainly we're very happy about the sharing with the shuttle's replacement library.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And of course, we are the bond is going to increase the size of the library. And so the need for the parking is even more than we had expected. Very glad to have the grocery store. And very sort of wistful about this being the last project of Lowry's.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Since I've been working on it for quite a while, but it certainly has been a very successful operation thanks to hundreds of people in the community and everybody working on LOWRY. So I urge my fellow council members to vote for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",

It is currently vacant and the proposal again to go from master planned row house three stories and private open space to master planned residential mixed use five stories.'",

        "'speaker_11': 'This was the strategy. You had the Near East, which was downtown all the way to. Probable bar. Then you have from Colorado Boulevard all the way to Quebec. That was called the Middle East. And then from Quebec on to Green Valley Ranch was called the Far East.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And then here comes the developments of the move with you had Stapleton coming in with no housing and yet the existing stock of housing that was occupied by black people, 95% owned. Yeah. And then you had to flip on the real estate and everything went upside down.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Anyway. So that had nothing to do with the rezoning. We're open to questions by members of Council. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Thank you. So my first question is about the. Tom, would you mind coming up? So is this site covered within the IATO, as was the rest of Stapleton?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yes. And excuse me, that's the Stapleton affordable housing plan specifically.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. So do you do we know yet whether this is going to include for sale or rental or maybe a combination?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We this parcel is part of section ten and we expect to have affordable rental and affordable foreseeable.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. And where are you guys at in terms of overall meeting the obligations under that housing plan for for Stapleton?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We, as you know, we have two components. We have an affordable rental and affordable for sale. Currently, we have affordable rental at 543 affordable rental units that have been completed as part of our donated land program for making that possible.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We've donated at the present time about 11 and a half acres. As you recall, the figure initially was eight acres. But the reality is, is that we have donated much more land than that because we've also donated needed land on the Affordable Ownership Program as well.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Together, the affordable rental and affordable for sale that have been completed are under construction as 1008 to 84 homes. We have the affordable rental is running probably at a little over, probably over 20% at the present time on the Affordable for sale, which has been challenged.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There's no question about that. We are running probably about 7%. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Can you tell me if this is the site that had the application that was received by the Colorado Land Board for drilling that they later. That was withdrawn?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'No. It was part of.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'His North Norfolk.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Yeah, it was not on Stapleton and it was I think to the east of that, I think. But I'm not absolutely sure.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay. I know they had gone on the Lowry. I mean, on the. The wildlife preserve with the arsenal.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'They are still here.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'But but I know there was one to sixth Avenue, so this this was not one of them. Okay. What what is the condition of the soils? Just looking at the map and the topography of it, it looks like there may have been some.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I don't know some soil's issues with it. So what is the condition of that?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'In this particular area, there was some bedrock that was discovered. And so what we did is we worked with staff to make an adjustment so that the open space was configured to be over the bedrock because it prevented, obviously homes from having basements, etc..'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So it's basically just an adjustment. Same amount of open space that was originally planned.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Okay, let me just make sure I've asked all my questions. Okay. I'm good. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilwoman Canete.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thanks so much, Mr. President. Hey, Tom, how are you? Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions that Councilwoman Ortega was asking. So it looks to me like we're looking at a slight increase in density here in theory.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So from the RO home three to the Annex five. Do you have a sense of how many additional market rate units or, you know, overall units that you're you're going to be able to do compared to what you would have under the old zoning.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Was to go with this or.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Take a look at that.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'An increase in density. I'm not a councilwoman. I'm not really sure, to be honest with you. I'd have to check that out.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'All right. Yeah. And the reason I'm asking is, I think as we've talked over the years, when we increase the amount of market rate housing that you're doing, it then increases the percentage needed to be affordable. And so it moves the goalposts in some ways in terms of the goal, because we have a percentage goal here.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I guess to to follow up on that question that Councilwoman Ortega was asking, we we worked with EDI to do some analysis to say what are our hopes, what are the barriers, what are the challenges to getting to the goal by by build out?'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I was just curious where that dialog is at. Are you still meeting regularly with the department? There were a few things they flagged that would need to happen for us to be on track because we do.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'We still continue to have meetings there. I think with the new housing officer, we have not yet met with that person, but the in particular the area where our transit oriented development is, we have already developed some affordable housing there, but we anticipate that there will be a more opportunities for higher density housing there and that will'",
        "'speaker_1': 'include additional affordable as well on ownership.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. So so no new announcements yet and how to make up the gap on the for sale side in term. I think their conclusion was that you would need to increase the pace of the affordable development. Right now it's kind of plodded along and it would need to increase considerably, which means using more developers at the same'",
        "'speaker_10': 'time. And then you would also need to to increase the density in a few of those places. So those were a couple of the recommendations. So are we in action mode on those or we're still figuring out?'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Well, and again, on the two pieces, first of all, on the affordable rental, that is something that requires in spite of the fact that we donate land and provide cash subsidies and requires traffic credits. And of course, that's a that's an issue to be dealt with there.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On the affordable ownership, we have experienced a greater pace of the affordable ownership. We have two very good developers of affordable northeast Denver Housing Center is one and then Thrive is doing another one as well. So that piece has picked up and we think that going with those two developers makes a lot of sense at this point'",
        "'speaker_1': '. Always in the back of our mind, we have talked about the possibility if it reaches a point that a another developer should be brought in. But we often make things more difficult for the two that are actually doing much better now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So our current plans are always just to stay with those two developers on the affordable ownership.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Okay. It's my understanding that the EDI analysis is was that if you continue that there is no way to meet the goal because they have a capacity, they can only do so much at one time. And so it concerns me to hear that a decision has been made not to change strategy, because the conclusion was that that'",
        "'speaker_10': 'strategy would not get us to the goal. So I will check back and that that's concerning to hear that. Okay. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you. Councilwoman, can each. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Theresa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I'm going to reference three slides because they're trying to understand this completely. Yeah, I think I understand it, but I need to see it and hear it from you guys. Slides five and six. One is the existing context zoning.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right there. One more. Next one.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'This one?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That one. So what I'm going to be referencing is the stuff that's being built out right now, which is currently our five on the west side of the open space. And then what is the proposed area which is which is currently RH three?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'One quick question actually, is the general building form? I mean, is the urban townhouse? Form part of. Did it address the master plan special context or not?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'm sorry, can you repeat your question?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So currently the, the if we're talking about those two zone districts, the R five and the RH three. Mm. They both allow single family, they also duplex they bought. But then the RH meaning rs5 then skips over garden court and and row house and goes right to the general building for.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The General Building Forum was one of the problems that we addressed with the slot Home Task Force. Does that apply to the match in this context? Yes. Okay. The. So now the next slide after this. If we're looking at those two areas, we see how the form the current rx5 has been developed.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Right. You have a little bit of retail along 56 or Northfield Boulevard, and then the rest is all largely single family duplex and largely single family with some. Townhouses on the edge that thrive this building. Now, if we go to the way in in the back set of slides where we're looking at the GDP.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Hmm. Oh. Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'What I want to know is, is if we're going to the zone district that allowed them to just plat and build tract after tract after tract of sort of single family housing. It does this GDP tell me that this will this will in fact have a different outcome or will have the same outcome.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The GDP doesn't get specific about which land uses where. I mean, it sort of does with its the patterns it has. But in the language, it's hard to read. But it's it basically says it's the intent of the developer to develop a range of housing types and know it's hard to read, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So what are we hearing from the owners representatives here? What? It sounds like you guys are are you sort of on the west side, even though it's the same zone district, you're sort of you're doing single family largely in this area is intended to be something else or is it going to be more of the same?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Do you want to answer that or.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Councilman. We're working with the.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Same homebuilders, bringing in the same product that you see on the west side of Section ten now.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. So under Mark's five, we can build garden courts under the general form.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In the west side, we actually have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Row homes completely lining the central median.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'On Beeler Bel-Air median right there.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So it is a blend of single family duplex row homes. And I guess I'm drawing a blank on a third right there. But it is it is going to be I don't want to say replication.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But same builders, same products with the exception of we've got one new builder, I.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Think we're talking about bringing in there. But no, no changes to our our recipe from what we've been building in Stapleton.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. Because I appreciate that. It's not that I wasn't I was actually expecting nor do I know that any other sort of concept would would be successful. I will just admit that I was a bit I was a bit green to the master plan zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I didn't actually understand the context until tonight. And I'm sitting here going, how to how is this our X5, the same animal that we're dealing with in other contexts? And it is. It is an. And and so I just needed that clarification.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I appreciate it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'It's a good question. But no no changes on our business.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Program there with the homebuilders we're working with now. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. This concludes the questions for members of council.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Sorry. Can I just clarify the building forms? I pulled out my code.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Would that be helpful?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Four or five urban house duplex in general. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So we didn't create an urban townhouse. And so you could theoretically not that any of your builders do this, but you could build a slot home out there. So choose.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Correct?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If that's the builder they select.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'They're looking for new places. I could tell you that much.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. This concludes the questions for members of council. This hearing for 24 is now closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Herndon.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Mr. President. It is amazing to think in 2008, prior to be on town council, when I first my real estate agent brought me into Stapleton at the Timeless East Bridge. What has become of this community? There was no East Bridge Town Center.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'There was no connections through the war. There was nothing north of I-70. Blessed Lake was the actual park, not the new neighborhood. And what it has become ten years later is truly remarkable. I'm in support of this. I will say that affordability is a prime concern for anyone.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I would encourage my colleagues, if you ever want to do a drive to with me, because I don't believe anyone on this day is has I'd be happy to drive through you and show the multiple sites. I do know Councilman Canete, who has been a champion for that, has done that with for city.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'I will also double check with Audi because I have been a part of those analysis when it has come to the affordability for city is doing a great job with the forint. There is a struggle with the first sale, but I've personally spoken with Jean Meyers of Thrive and Gate with Northeast Denver housing toward their products and'",
        "'speaker_1': 'toward their sites. And there's still the possibility coming at the TOD site. So I am confident that we are going to hit that. And you're already doing that above when it comes to the for rent cap housing is going again for traffic credits.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Northeast Denver how they are doing their product off of Moline which take section eight vouchers I believe. And I mean, there's not another community in this city where I can say we have those transitioning, transitioning from homelessness, are living next to those and almost multimillion dollar houses.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'And so the success of Stapleton is truly remarkable. And I want to applaud all those who had the vision, community members, elected officials beforehand for what this community has become. And it's amazing that this is the last major piece north of 56.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So can I want to congratulate you on that? And I would encourage my colleagues to support this so we continue to move forward this development. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Councilman Kelso, Indonesia.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with my colleague's comments about, you know, the the the impressive quantity of housing and the the important developers who are doing it. They are doing a great job. And I have done, I think, two of the twice I've toured.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And I think there was quite a bit of progress even in between those tours as well as being some of those groundbreaking. But one of the things I'm faced with today is a decision about whether or not the proposed zoning is in conformance with the plans.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And one of the adopted plans for this site includes the fact that there are contractual obligations. And I think one of the things that I regret our predecessors didn't do is they didn't require that the proportionality of the housing occur along with the development.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And so we're in this unfortunate position of back loading, particularly the for sale housing. And so I have to evaluate the zoning decision and whether it's going to impede our ability to conform with those contractual obligations. And every time we increase the number of housing units overall, we increase as a as I described in my question, the'",
        "'speaker_10': 'goalpost moves for the affordability. You cannot build a 100% affordable condo project at a Tier D. I hope that's really important for folks to understand that you can't get it financed. The FHA will not underwrite the loans for the individuals who live in those condos to be able to get there first time homeowners.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So you can put some of the affordability in a in a single building attitude, but you can't probably exceed 50%, which means then you have every the rest of that is going to be market rate. So and 50% is high.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'There aren't very many condo projects that are that are at that rate of affordability, which means you're going to, again, be increasing the number of market rate units as well. So I have to be able to see a path to know that if we're going to increase the amount of market rate housing, that we have a specific'",
        "'speaker_10': 'time allocated plan for how we're going to do that. And that that's where, you know, we spend a considerable amount of time going over the math. There is enough land, I believe it's possible there probably is enough financing and and demand to make to make those projects financeable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'In terms of the the loan market, how much will one lender give to one developer is a question, a concern. And this I worked with with both Gate and Jean. They're both really great developers. This isn't about them.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'This is about, though, the contractual obligation. And the contractual obligation then falls on us as a city to enforce. So if we end up at this finish line and we're not there, then the question about how we go about legally enforcing it becomes our responsibility and how I say to the constituents who continue to share their concerns'",
        "'speaker_10': 'not just about the pace of new housing, but our loss of housing as some of those units time out because they're getting to that 15 year, the 15 year. Covenant period is ending on some of them in very short order.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just can't without more information to indicate to me how we are recalibrating to make sure that we don't just meet the existing goal, but now we meet an increased goal because the zoning increases the capacity. I can't support it today because of the conformance with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It does meet the other criteria in terms of, you know, being the right mix for this location. But but but that legal agreement is is an important one that we're bound, I think, to enforce as a city. And it would be inappropriate for me to say, go ahead.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'And then at the back end say, oh, I got you because you didn't you didn't fulfill the agreement. I think we're your partner in this. I think it's up to the city to help to develop strong criteria and enter into those negotiations to make sure we are helping this community achieve this goal because we're not just achieving'",
        "'speaker_10': 'it. For the residents of Stapleton, where we you know, we're achieving it for the overall citizens of Denver who forwent significant resources through the tax increment financing in order to make it possible. So it really, you know, in my mind, this is a goal that belongs to the entire city as well as to the residents who believe'",
        "'speaker_10': 'in the vision of that diversity. And we owe it to both of them to to make sure that these earnings conform with the plans. And I just can't find that tonight. So I will have to vote. No, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I am not intending to contradict what I but Councilwoman Kennedy just said. But I do see it slightly different in that the the the forms that the allowed forms in the existing zoning versus the proposed zoning based on if you're building essentially the same thing using the same product.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I mean, developers, you, you, you basically can keep going. There's there's nothing in the current current use by right situation that couldn't allow you to develop most of what you're doing. So the carve out, I mean, the ability to go from the garden court in the row house to add the general, that actually gives you a lot'",
        "'speaker_5': 'more latitude to be able to develop these affordable units to do to do, to be more economical and efficient with your square footage and to deliver these units. And you know that I'm saying that from an informed place, having worked out there and done these very same things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That said, I remember having these conversations, which is, yeah, you guys weren't expecting when you started this project some however long ago was you had a wildly successful market and you weren't expecting a couple of years, couple of three years of recession.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But you've had you were also weren't expecting this degree of prosperity. And so I do think that there is in your business model, there should be I don't get into your financials and whatnot, but there should be the capacity to push these and help these guys deliver these units at a faster clip on the affordable side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So and I do see the general building form as helping deliver on those those needs. So I will be supporting this zoning, but I'm going to put it on for city. I'm saying that if it doesn't get done, it's because for a city didn't bite the bullet and dig in and make this happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I think that I. I believe you guys can. So let's close the gap. There's still some struggles in the business side of things. I get that on the on the commercial side of things, but there is no problem on the residential side of the proforma.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so please, we have a need. This is a great place for families and people to start and a long, a very long, prosperous life in Denver. And but if they don't have the opportunity, it can't happen that way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So please provide those opportunities. This zoning, this additional little carve out gives you that additional flexibility. Please use it to deliver on what is needed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'All right, Councilwoman Ortega, I'll be brief.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And Stapleton has been very successful with the development, both with commercial as well as residential. I share the concern that we have not yet been able to get there on the for sale side. I know on the rental side we've done very, very well.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'And I would just ask that rather than wait till we get to the end, that we have, you know, periodic updates where you guys come in and tell us where where this is going bring you into our. Council committee to to do an update, maybe with our housing subcommittee to just monitor where that's at, because I think'",
        "'speaker_6': 'we all want to make sure that that that goal is met. And if we just wait till the end, then shame on all of us for not really tracking it in a way that could be a lot more intentional.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'So that would be my request to our current and incoming president. So I'll be voting for this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We have an incoming president. I'm just telling Councilwoman Quinn each year.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'Thank you. I did just want to add one more fact to the record, because I think I glossed over it in the mention of rental reminded me there are two components in the housing agreement that that was signed.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'One was an aspirational goal about the quantity of rental overall, and the second was the portion of that that would be affordable. Where Staples in is doing a great job is on the portion of the rental that is affordable.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'It's higher than the aspirational vision in the agreement, but the overall quantity of rental is far lower. And I have to put this on the record because I'll get an email from a cab member by the morning if I don't.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'But the cab will tell you that the overall there is much less rental in the entire project than was envisioned. And whether it's dedicated as affordable or whether it is simply just rental housing, which generally is more accessible for folks who may not be candidates for for for sale, that is an aspect to the mixed income vision'",
        "'speaker_10': 'that is is not quite where the community expected it to be, where the agreement estimated it to be. That is not a binding piece of the agreement. But I did just want folks to know that when you analyze those quarterly reports and time, you're great.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'I appreciate you sending them. You guys have been transparent and shared everything we've asked you to. But but you can you can track this, and you have to pay attention to the total number of rental units, not just the percentage, because the percentage is high, but the overall number is low.'",
        "'speaker_10': 'So I just because I glossed over that, I just wanted to make sure I clarified the record and and because I know the community will catch me if I if I didn't clarify that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I sure will. Thank you. Councilwoman. Can each. And the only thing I have to add is a.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Gentleman heard it. You know, I was just going to offer that they they do come. I think there's some generalizations that I, I wouldn't characterize as fair to the to the builder right now, but it's not the appropriate form to have this element on chambers.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'But as someone who has lived here and lived this for a long time, I have no doubt the developer's commitment to affordability. And there are some things that have changed when it comes to that number. As we have talked about with the cab, the fact that one neighborhood, Central Park West, is a huge residential neighborhood, the original'",
        "'speaker_1': 'intent that was supposed to be commercial, but there was no interest in commercial at that time. So being adaptable and being flexible for city with residential, what's the community embraced? And that did change the number overall and has an impact.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just think there's some things that we're just not getting specific enough that I don't think is fair. So I would offer that this does come to committee of those councilmembers are interested or come to a cab meaning we talk about this regularly affordability.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'So I just wanted to just throw that out. There's, there's some numbers that we're not getting into now that I think we should before we make generalizations. But I, I would hope that the majority of this body would move to support and support this.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Okay. Any other comments? Going once i will say Councilman Herndon, another area where homeless housing is next to $1,000,000 homes is right here in your downtown. All right. I will be supporting this as well. Great debate, everyone. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Herndon. I Cashman. I can eat. Lopez All right. New Ortega. I. Sussman. I black. Clark All.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Flynn All.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. Gilmore I Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I police. So the following US results of.'",
        "'speaker_3': '2012.'",
