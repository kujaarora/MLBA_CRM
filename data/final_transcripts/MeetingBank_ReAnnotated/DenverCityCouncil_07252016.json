Whereas, Denver Public Works has partnered with local nonprofit organization Earth Force since 2012 to design and implement the innovative Keep It Clean Neighborhood Environment Trio's kick net program of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education for teachers and students in Denver and its neighboring municipalities.'",

WHEREAS, Kyknet has been adopted in 24 schools and resulted in 63 student led environmental action projects to date and will continue to reach more than 1500 students and 100 teachers annually as they conduct watershed investigations and make improvements in our urban waterways.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'It's I got a job when I was 17 years old working on the South Platte River in the Cherry Creek and fell in love. And that's the work I did for my entire life before I landed here and got to work with this program, keep it clean from drain the stream and the kidnap program and Darren and'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Donnie. And it's a phenomenal program. And it's something that those of us who have been quite literally almost baptized in the South Platte River forget that the very basics of how our stormwater system work is not common knowledge.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I was sitting at the parade, the St Patrick's Day parade, five, six, seven years ago, now sitting there on the curb with my wife and my two kids watching the parade go by. And I just happened to be sitting right on top of one of our storm drains, which anything that goes in that storm drain goes'",
        "'speaker_2': 'right into the South Platte River. We were in downtown right, right over there with no filtration. Whatever goes down there goes straight into the river and people don't know that. And there was a woman walking in the parade carrying a piece of trash.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And before I even knew what was happening, she took that piece of trash, said, Oh, thank goodness, and threw it right underneath me into the storm drain. She clearly made the choice to not litter, to not let that piece of trash go there.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'She was trying to throw it away and yet had no understanding that by putting it in there, she had fast tracked it to not only be a piece of litter blowing around in downtown Denver, but to being a piece of trash floating around in our most precious natural resource.'",

        "'speaker_2': 'We have given our council members a copy of one of the their six pending applications, and it is a copy of one of the designs of one of the six. And his garden court is 50 to 60 feet wide rather than the minimum of 15 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it can be a beautiful design and we're looking forward to seeing it reevaluated and implemented in the future. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I just wanted to add that thank you for for bringing these amendments forward. And and I just want to make it very clear that this moratorium should have happened years ago, because the problems related to this garden court form have been in the code since 2010 when it was adopted.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But wherever this this pause had taken would have taken place, projects would have been impacted. So I just you know, there may be concerns. There are a few in the queue right now, but that would have been the case at any point in time, really, unless we found some sort of law.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so I just wanted to share that. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I am going to support this, but I'm not promising. I'm going to support it when it comes up for a final vote until we all learn more about it. We just learned about this a week ago.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I totally agree that there are issues with the garden court form and they need to be addressed. But I just want to understand better the impacts on current projects. I don't want to. Abuse anyone's property rights who may have plans already done and that their property was already zoned for this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Just as when we looked at the marijuana laws, we decided to honor those pending applications. So I just want to be very clear that I want to learn more about this before I'm going to vote for it in in about a few weeks or more.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I am going to support this because I do believe that this is something that needs to be looked at. There are a lot of things within our zoning code. Ever since we adopted a new foreign based zoning code in 2010, that this is going to create garden.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'This garden build is one of them. And if you look close enough and a lot of it, a lot of our code that there's going to be a lot of things that don't match or you need to have a little bit more emphasis and guidance.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's that's what we do as a council. That's one of our primary powers and roles per charter. So looking at this in the further detail is something I look forward to seeing and participating in. However, I do feel that there are some folks that if they are in the queue, that as a council that we be'",
        "'speaker_3': 'mindful of this date on the 25th and time this date for folks who are already in the queue and have been operating and and using funds and having their plans reviewed, adopting their plans, getting looking and in process.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I think it would. It would. And the spirit of the previous action of this council on marijuana. I think it's it's important that we mind the folks that are already in there, since we have already set a precedent in doing that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So but I do look forward to it. It's going to be interesting. Garden court is a rare but very, very if done right, it can be very beautiful. It's protected. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. Councilman Nu, there you have. You gave us a schematic of one of the six applications that are in the pipeline where your amendment would allow this to proceed. What's the status of the other five?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Because I. I don't want to prevent folks who have abided by the process and are in the pipeline. I don't want to cut them off cold as we did not with the the marijuana moratorium. And as also tonight, we're not doing with the small lot parking exemptions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yeah. Thank you, Councilman. Of the six pending applications, three of them are just in constant review right now. Okay. One the one that you had the diagram on Boulevard. One is inside site. Build a plan and it meets all the criteria as well as the exception so it can move forward nicely.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And it's a wonderful picture of what I think we want in the future. The other two are also in site of urban planning, so none have been approved, have gotten zoning permits or or close to building permits yet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So they're in that stage where I think there's really some discussion and redesign. I think they could apply easily with the exceptions.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So none of the other five applications. Three in all five right now in their current state would not go forward under this moratorium.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I'll see if they redesign. If they meet the the exceptions, then they all can move forward. No question about them.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we don't know. If they do meet the exception.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Not yet. Only example we've got is the one boulevard one. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Before I vote, I would like to know if the other five would be able to go forward. Because I want to honor I want to honor the fact that people followed our rules.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, Councilman Espinosa, talk about that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that I. I made the request from CPD for all six concepts that have been submitted so that they can all be reviewed the same way this one has. So we really don't know what what would or wouldn't conform as is.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. So I'm uncomfortable voting yes unless I know that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But so sometime in the very near future, we'll have that. As soon as I have that, I'll share that with my colleagues. We have four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But you won't have that before roll call. This is my point. No. Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Flynn, if it's okay with you. Councilwoman Sussman also has a little bit to say about your question.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That was all I had.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Okay. But she's speaking, I think, to your question.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes. Thank you very much. And I believe that is a really good question. And I know that coming up is a full referral of this bill to committee in the next two weeks so that we can have those sorts of discussions.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Because I would just echo what Councilwoman Black Councilman Lopez said, that we want to be careful about those in the Q know where they are in the Q, what the process is and abide by our sets that we had with the marijuana bill that those who are acting in good faith can depend upon our rules to some'",
        "'speaker_5': 'extent. So it is going to committee. I think you'll be referring it right, councilman, to in just the next few minutes so that we can have further discussions. This is just to publish it. It's not to agree to it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Mr. President, could I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yep. Go ahead, gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Okay. Just a follow up question. If if we're going to refer to committee, should we bother amending it now or should we leave that to the committee to to actually formulate the final draft of the bill?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We'd like to ask that you be amended now then we can we discuss it a little bit? Committee. No, not thoroughly as we want to discuss it afterwards, but we'd like to publish it as amended today. Anything else, Councilman?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilwoman Sussman, did you have anything in addition to the answer?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Oh, thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. And Councilman Espinosa, if I'd never mind. Councilman condition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I had two questions. The first was, does the amendment only allow folks who've already submitted applications to amend or adjust their applications to meet these criteria? Or in theory, does the amendment make it such that any applicant who comes forward during the entire moratorium period could continue to have their application processed under these'",
        "'speaker_11': 'standards?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's my understanding that any application can come forward.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Is that okay? Great. And then I recognize this may be more applicable to the next motion, but just so I understand, if we if we vote yes on the amendment and then we we would be doing the vote to refer it to committee, would that in terms of the 30 day clock and all of that?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'I just want to understand what the implications of voting on the amendment tonight and having the bill as amended. Do you in terms of timeline as it relates to going back to committee? So someone can explain that to me.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'If we can vote on the amended bill tonight, then the second reading in the public hearing will be on August the 22nd to be 30 days. If we do not amend that tonight and then the there will be a different time period will be a later time period when it goes to committee.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So can I just clarify then. So if there is a motion to refer to committee, it does not slow down the clock between first and second reading yesterday. Okay. For explaining that it just these votes are related.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So understanding the full picture is important. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Kels. Is that. Is that all comfortable? All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Also have a question for Councilman Nu. Can you just explain what the conversations have been with the planning department that assure that they will be involved in helping to clean up this language and make sure that we don't have, you know, what has appeared to be conflicting sections of the zoning code around this particular issue?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, we've had several conversations with CPD and with the planners and and and the supervisor of CPD and everybody's in agreement. And this was actually this the garden code form was actually on the list that needed to be addressed and changes to the zoning code.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So it's not a new issue and I think is something they will recognize just because it's been not being implemented as they really are, I guess anyone desires. So there's been extensive conversations and discussions with them and they they recommended the 12 month period to review and we will restructure the work load to make sure it happens'",
        "'speaker_2': 'within that 12 months.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No further questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. So those discrepancies that you and Councilwoman Ortega was mentioning, those have existed. And that's one of the things if you've been paying attention, I hope you haven't. I've been harping on for the better part of a year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Well, for exactly one year since I've been on council. Time and time again, because we've allowed zoned districts that allow this form and the density that's associated with it. But it's clearly not part of the intent of those zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so there's this this real confusion. And so one of the things is, is that the moratorium, as proposed without the amendments, was actually very clean. It just said, look, we're going to stop using this this this form until we take the time that we should have to address it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I had already been working with CPD to do just that some time before the end of the year. But because of our workload, we just simply don't have enough time to get that done. And so rather than keep allowing sort of egregious projects, take advantage of this, yeah, it needs to be addressed.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that said, the purpose of the amendment is actually to allow it to sort of continue to persist, something akin to what was intended in the existing code that is commensurate with rowhouse sort of forms where it's allowed but not.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so we won't go into that because that's a wholly different. Litigation. And I'm sorry if I'm confusing anybody, but there are problems with this form as defined and has recorded in documented in the zoning code. And a moratorium is the right tool.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'When you have a problem in your zoning code and you need to address it and you want to sort of take a breather to take the time to do that. The these simple provisions would allow development, fairly dense development, to move forward on those parcels while sort of preserving the.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Defi means the demonstrated or illustrated intent of this form district. So I could illustrate with these boxes, but I'll spare you all. But I just wanted to make that very clear that I have been talking about this. I have addressed it in numerous planning committees and from this day as previously.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. And Councilman Espinosa, you're actually you're very right. You do bring this up. And I thank you for sort of giving us a sense of where we might be able to make improvements in the garden court.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I do believe that we perhaps need to discuss this. My only concern, and I hope that we will be able to work on this in committee, is that the hurry up nature of the direct filing of this bill seems to be pointed to a or several particular projects.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And while this is a citywide issue, I wasn't sure about the speed with which we needed to do this. So looking forward to the discussion in committee.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank Mr. President pro tem. And thank you, Councilman Nu and Espinosa. And I think I understand where you're going, but I am uncomfortable voting to move this forward. Even with this amendment, if it would mean that the other five applications and the work that went into them in good faith would not be allowed to go forward.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In other words, the moratorium should apply only to any future applications. This would be a precedent that would be set here where we did not do this with pending marijuana applications, marijuana applications, and we're not doing it tonight on the other ordinance that has a moratorium on it.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'So I'm uncomfortable going forward with it, as is and ordering it published. Even though I support the direction you're going, I don't think that it's I think we need to be fair to people who follow the process, even though I support where you're going with the overall bill.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I just want to make clear that the vote for the amendment does not make that the case. Only a subsequent vote for the moratorium in four weeks time. So this is simply to amend with this this provision to allow these these these development proposals with the that meet these exceptions to proceed going forward in the moratorium'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Once it is if it is adopted.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Back to Councilman for just a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But we're voting right afterward and ought to order it published. Correct. And I'm uncomfortable with that. I think the bill should follow the normal procedure and go to committee and before we order it published so that we have a committee recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we have them. We have all this language worked out. So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem, I. I guess I want to fully understand and this might be a question for Mr. Broadwell. So if we vote on this tonight to have it published and then it's referred back to committee and through the conversations in committee, if there are further amendments or what we're talking about right here around'",
        "'speaker_4': 'honoring folks who are already in the process, would there be the opportunity to further amend it or. I just have that question.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'David Broadwell, assistant city attorney. The answer is it depends. Most likely changes in committee would require republication and would kick out the hearing date further. If you order if if if the bill tonight, if the amendment passes and then the bill garners enough votes to order it published, then we're going to proceed to post public notice of'",
        "'speaker_8': 'a hearing four weeks hence about the bill as it came out tonight. See, so if the substance of the bill were to change later, you would probably have to do a new publication several weeks out of another hearing date.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so it could potentially change things at that point. Is that clear enough?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Thank you. And so with with that knowledge, you know, I we did set precedent with the marijuana process and that we honored folks that were in the process in the Q and I, you know, think that that's an important precedent that was set.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am, you know, citing, I think, with Councilman Flynn, that it does make me uncomfortable voting on something and having it published and not having the opportunity to have further conversations, especially when people have made investments and have I have no idea the amount of money that folks have maybe invested in moving forward with their projects'",
        "'speaker_4': '. Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to make something very clear to everybody here that this is actually normal process. This is fully within our powers as members of council to bring forward a bill such as this at any point in time. It does not need to go through some sort of set of set of hoops.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is this is one of the things that we can do as members of council to work to preserve or move forward or benefit our communities. So this is normal process. By putting it back in committee to have a discussion, we can actually have this discussion about the merits of these amendments and maybe there needs to be'",
        "'speaker_0': 'additional amendments and then go back into this other process and all that stuff. So we have the tools to to modify even with a vote for approval with the, you know, publishing right now. I mean, there's nothing about publishing that make this a foregone conclusion.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, you just you just want to let Councilwoman Gilmore and Councilman Flynn know that we tried to get it to the committee last week, too, and the agenda was so fortunate. Councilwoman Sussman, this committee is just jammed with all kind of activities.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And what was interesting about it is we ended up expediting and doing a lot of great work last week and then ended up having a lot of time at the end. You know, we had a just sort of a general discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It wasn't a thorough discussion like we we want to have at the next committee meeting. But but we were intended to bring it through the committee structure first and we just couldn't get it on the agenda because how busy they are.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But we want to have a real thorough discussion about all pending applications and this bill next time. Thank you, Councilman new Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. I'm sharing the concerns on both sides of this. I'm concerned that we honor the people who are legitimately in the pipeline, have been following the rules that we set up. I also share Councilman Newark Councilman Espinosa's concerns that some of the I don't think horrendous is too tough a term horrendous abuses'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of the garden court form that once built will live on forever. So I'm going to vote to move this forward. But with the confidence that with it going to committee and if it makes it out of committee to the floor for a second reading that we'll have adequate time to vet and amend if it's the council conscience'",
        "'speaker_8': 'that amendments are needed. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just have to say, you know, one comment and 98, which is a moratorium with the exact same provisions which would stymie or stifle any projects that aren't to a certain point in time. So I just don't it doesn't comport that we're willing to do a moratorium on small lots.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But without any concern about those projects that might be in the queue. But suddenly now we're concerned about projects that are in the queue. You know, we if we vote. If we don't vote to publish this, we shouldn't vote to publish for 98.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm by no means advocating that because both of these are bills that we should be moving forward and discussing and having to vote on in four weeks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem, I guess, for both of my colleagues. Councilman Nu and Councilman Espinosa, I appreciate where you're wanting to take this and where you want to go with it. You know, the the the small lot moratorium that's been a conversation of a little bit over a month or so.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'With that project, I just was able to get my briefing from you, Councilman Espinosa, at 430 this afternoon. I know we were going to try to do two, but, you know, it's the day of. And just to really understand what this is entailing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I want to make sure I'm understanding and I don't know if it's appropriate for Councilman Nu or Councilman Espinosa to answer this question, but where? Under the new language that you're inserting into the ordinance. Could you just explain one more time what that exactly means for the projects that are in the queue?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'What would be the additional items that they would have to then comply with if they aren't currently in compliance with it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Yes, on the first provision exemption we're talking about is really is redefining the width of the garden court to equal to or greater than the height of the building. Most of these are zoned three stories and I think it's about like 35 feet.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So we've actually done some in which will talk about and show at the committee who does review of existing garden courts and they're about 30, 35 feet. So it seems to have seems about equal to what the building height is.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We thought that was a good good way to talk about that minimum with the others is rowhouse development.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'The they're not being stacked on top of each other. Then the example that the diagram I gave you shows those Rowhouse shows a row house development on the boulevard, one that is very nicely done with a 50 to 60 foot courtyard as well as each individual row houses together without any kind of snacking on top of each'",
        "'speaker_2': 'other, which is probably the intent. And this is something where.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is going to be a tiny bit esoteric. But what it boils down to is right now in the Westword that I believe came out today electronically, they talked about slot houses and these townhouses that have this narrow gap.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So right now, the garden court, the minimum garden court with is 15 feet. So you can have a 35 foot high structure with a 15 foot garden court with no real requirement that you can plant anything in there.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's not the intent. And so, yes, what we're saying is that this now gap this gap now has to be as wide as you are tall. So if you're going to do a 34 foot, 35 foot high building, you have to have a 30 foot five foot wide garden court so you can have a fighting chance'",
        "'speaker_0': 'at getting some sun down there and planting some things and having an actual garden. So that's one of the exceptions because the slot houses were not intended in this. And therein lies the problem is in the row house, they own districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And this is going to be part of the subsequent rezoning tonight in the row house zone districts, a row house, everyone has a very clear definition. Even the zoning code has a clear definition about a row houses. These are buildings in units that face the street.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The row House districts clearly defined that you're allowed to have a urban house floor, a duplex house, four in a row, house floor. It makes no mention of the garden court for yet the garden court is allowed. And so now you can have these slot houses that are perpendicular when all the other forms in the intent orient'",
        "'speaker_0': 'themselves to the street. So this garden, this this exception is still allowing that garden court form to exist, which shouldn't be allowed in a row house in district, provided that it has a healthy, viable garden court. Associated with it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And then it further compels that that a-road mean that the units be not stacked so that they're each like townhouses, that the units that comprise the garden court all orient themselves to the court or to the street individual units, because right now it's just a form.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so if you do a 15 foot slot and you put the doors facing that way, you can then put that door attached to any number of condo units behind that door. And that's that was never again intended for the Rogerstone district, at least as defined in the building code and in the zoning code, Denver's zoning code'",
        "'speaker_0': '. So these two amendments actually address that concern going forward for the next 12 months and say no, even though we know that we have that conflict, you can now use this form with these exceptions rather than live in a series of of of of confusion, the land of confusion, where people are using this form, where it isn't'",
        "'speaker_0': 'in the intent statement, but it is in a use in a form table. And we haven't vetted out which one of those where it is has more gravitas. But I'm pretty sure that if we keep going down this road, we're probably going to get a legal challenge to find out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so the moratorium is critical to actually finally addressing this concern.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So my last question, Mr. President, pro tem, is if this is equivalent to the small lot moratorium, why aren't we utilizing the exact same language as far as the the the bills and creating new language to be interpreted?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman, new councilman. I'm not sure I know the answer to that question. I. Maybe Mr. Broadwell, he might. Of the.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Well, probably not, but but I. It does give me a chance to comment on something I heard earlier. I don't have the small lot parking exemption language in front of me, but my understanding and recollection of it is that that bill does, in fact, grandfather applications in the pipeline entirely.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Right. And then it says when the moratorium is in place, some some small light exemptions will still be granted when the moratorium is in place. Many will not be allowed anymore. But the issue that's been focused on by Councilman Flynn and and one or two others about how it treats applications in the pipeline is different from this'",
        "'speaker_8': 'bill and different from this bill even as amended. The bill as amended tonight, if the amendment goes on, will allow some of the pending applications to continue through, but will presumably cut off others of the pending applications. But I believe the small light parking exemption bill does have the kind of language we use when all pending applications'",
        "'speaker_8': 'are allowed to continue. The moratorium would only have prospective effects to and applicability to future applications. That's that's the shape it was in last time I saw it. And I see some heads nodding.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Pro Tem. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Kinney.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. Pro Tem President. That was my main question. I guess my second question is, I don't do we have someone here from development services? So my question is, if someone can please explain to me the difference between the cutoff point here, which is, I believe concepts, approval and building permits.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Exactly. Can you just distinguish between those two gaits for me?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Sure. Thanks. So I'm Kyle Dalton. I'm principal city planner with Community Planning and Development, and I've been authorized to speak for development services tonight too, so that CPD has been provided the text of the amendment. So I don't I mean, I'll try to write it as fast as councilman new read it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you know, we got a draft about an hour ago that was different than what was read tonight. So the amendment speaks to this. I can't speak to that. But the Bills has drafted and has filed. There was a difference between the two bills that I think Mr. Broadwell accurately reflected.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the the small parking exception. Thank you. The small light parking exception, Bill. Um, grand grandfathers, if you will. Anyone who's applied for a concept review, which is kind of the first step in a site development plan review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if you're in with concept, if you're informal, you can continue all the way to receive your approval and receive your permits, irrespective of the exclusions. Then there are exclusions that apply to new applications. So for new applications, if you met the two, one of the two criteria that are in that bill, you could continue.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Everything else is stopped under the Garden Court bill that you're considering tonight. It actually stops all approvals. So anyone who has a concept review or a site development plan review, if they're ready to get their permit the day after you you pass the bill, we would deny it until the moratorium lapses.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. That was a very good description of the bill. I guess I actually want to understand better what is the difference between the plans that someone has when they have a site review approved versus when they get their building permit?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So can you give me a degree of if you're in site review, you're at 20%, 80% design. And if you're at building permit, you're at 100% design. Help me understand functionally where a project is at when it's at the site.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Concept, concept, use the term again, please. Concept review.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Concept review.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Yeah.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when someone's applied for concept review, they're required to submit a site plan that meets a number of things on our submittal checklist. And sort of the first idea of the massing, the use, the number of units, if it's a residential project, they're required to demonstrate a few things for fire.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It's kind of it's it's the first idea that requires more than a napkin sketch, but it's a free review that requires a plan to be submitted. So that's that's the concept review. Now, your question about the difference between site plan and building permit.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'No, I think you've adequately answered it. Thank you. Just wanted to get a sense that it's not a full architectural it's not a full, complete architectural plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The concept is not.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'That's correct. Thank you. So that that's actually really helpful for me. Really quickly, I'm just going to comment before I vote then, which is to say that I think that if this if without this amendment, there would be no chance of me supporting this bill because it would literally stop projects that are already in a pipeline.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'But this I would distinguish from the marijuana, the amended language. I would distinguish from the marijuana moratorium in that the mayor, when we were discussing marijuana licensing, the idea would have been or the proposal was to literally not allow businesses to open who had already spent money on construction design, bought land, bought stores, and to literally say'",
        "'speaker_11': 'you cannot operate. And that is unconscionable. This provision in this amendment, although I'm not you know, I need to see the committee discussion and understand it better, allows a path for someone to revise and continue to proceed. So to me, I'm not sure yet where my vote will be on final reading after I, but I would like'",
        "'speaker_11': 'to hear testimony from folks. I think about the concept review phase and understand that more from the perspective of those who testify. But I will be supporting the amendment tonight because I believe it is a path to giving folks options.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So that is by no means you know, I want to hear all the testimony. I want to hear the committee discussion. But but I will be supporting the amendment because it allows an option for someone to revise but continue to be in business, which in my mind is very different.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Very different than saying you are out of business, period. So. So I will be supporting the amendment tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mr. President, my my comments are just straight out of regarding process. We've been debating this on the floor for 45 minutes. This should be talked about and discussed in committee, not on the floor. We need the proper community notification, public participation.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I want to refer it to committee. I don't mind it being published. I'm glad the amendments there. But we have a lot of folks here who had signed up to speak on numerous things tonight and not expecting to sit through another hour of committee work.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So I would. I would. Respectfully suggest you call the question on this. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah. I just want to make that distinction between the the small moratorium and this one, though, is that that was a case of unintended consequences. And it's a it is a clear cut. We were doing something that we had envisioned unintended consequences where we're shutting that down while we figure it out.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'This is a situation where we have conflicting language in our code and it makes us vulnerable to getting it right. It's not actually conflicting language in the multi-unit zone districts. It's only conflicting language in the rowhouse zone districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The problem with us making an amendment and we'll talk about this in committee, the problem is this making exceptions for the multi-unit is then we proceed to continue to have the conflicting language in the house. And so the exceptions for oddly written are to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'To address that to basically allow this to. To proceed. Now that's that's now getting into I won't get into the specifics. They're happy to do that in in committee. But this is clarifying language to sort of allow for the next 12 months to proceed healthily in this form while we figure out what the way how to correct'",
        "'speaker_0': 'all of the numerous zoning districts where the conflict does or doesn't exist, and then to add it where it should have been by code.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Point of order. Mr. President, when we have a vote to call the question, that means we are voting to cut off discussion.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. It was not my understanding that Councilman Lopez called the question that he was encouraging me to call the question. Did I misunderstand?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Councilman Lopez respectfully asked that we call the question so we can discuss this in committee.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'You didn't move that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Oh, I can move it if you like.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And you had those accompanying the memo that I sent. That's the only thing I have to report.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you very much. So we do have two individuals tonight, one representing the applicant and one representing the neighborhood. And so I'll call on in order. First up, we have Douglas macKinnon. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Pro tem. My name is Doug macKinnon. I reside in Denver 730 17th Street, suite 220 members of Council. Thank you for the opportunity to come back before you. Councilman Kasich, I think you brought the motion. For us to stumble through the steps.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But since that time, we have reached out, as you requested, to the neighborhood organization. We've had several meetings. The meetings began with a concept. We shared a concept of what we were proposing for the property as we requested that concept.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'You may remember a little bit of about the site. It's about a 400 foot long rectangular site facing Colorado Boulevard. The first concept we shared with the neighborhood was a four building concept that had in each of these individual buildings, approximately 12 to 15 units.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The entire project was part of underground primary ingress, and egress was off Colorado Boulevard with secondary egress and access off the private alley to the eastern edge of it. That meeting was attended by the leadership of the R.A., as well as a group of concerned neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We had a very spirited dialog. We did not come to a resolution. But at that initial meeting, we proposed that we would cap the units at 54 units on that property. We also offered that we would provide a covenant running with the land to secure that in favor of the neighborhood organization.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We subsequently received commentary from the neighborhood organization that indicated they were uncomfortable with that number, that they wanted only between 20 to 24 units on the property. And in addition, they tried to share with us their concern that the most appropriate comparison for that property was a property, the former Mount Gilbert property, across Moorpark.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We did not feel comfortable with that comparison, but we did go back to work. We presented a revised concept which reduced the four buildings down to three buildings on the site. Again, three individual buildings, complete underground parking, primary access of Colorado Boulevard, secondary access off the private alley.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In that proposal, we had limited the units down to 48 units. We went back and forth and again a circular, somewhat circular dialog occurred. This time it should be noted that the you know, I very much appreciate the leadership of the R.A. They reached out to us on a smaller group basis to have a principled a principled'",
        "'speaker_7': 'dialog. So myself and my two co-owners of the property met with the R.A. President, Mr. McCormick, the head of zoning committee, Mr. Sweeney, and Mr. Michael Hughes, who I don't think is here tonight. So we very much appreciated and embraced that dialog to try to see if we can come to a resolution.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That also was a long meeting was attended by Teresa as well hosted by the city. And at the end of that meeting, we had come to an attempt to to resolve the issue. We'd asked the neighborhood group to give us.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Rick I'm sorry, that is the 3 minutes. So in the interest of fairness, I'm going to give the neighborhood their 3 minutes. Don't go far. Council members may have questions and bring you back up once we get to the questions.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'But I want to stick to our commitment to 3 minutes for each side. Jay McCormick.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Hello. Good evening, President Pro Tem Karch and members of the council. My name is jay mccormack. I am president of the Kramer Park Hilltop Civic Association. I reside in Denver at 141 South Claremont Street. Thank you for the time.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We, as Mr. macKinnon described, we had a series of meetings with the development group in different formats, and Teresa Lucero attended the final one, which went on for a long time. At the end of that meeting, I think where Doug McKinnon was going was the seeming to be, as far as they could go, was to bring their'",
        "'speaker_3': 'number of units down to roughly 40 units still in the garden court format. We took that back both to our R.A. board and how to vote. We also put it out to survey as many people as we got from the neighborhood using SurveyMonkey and then also accepted comments via email.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The board voted to oppose the rezoning for the reasons stated in the documents I've given you, and generally it had to do with confusion and worries about the garden court format, which seems to be a key topic here tonight.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The density being so much greater than had been proposed in Blueprint Denver. Many neighbors are indeed looking over at the Cress more project on the Hilliard site and regarding that as an appropriate density for this one acre site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And finally, there's not been substantial traffic studies. We have no idea. It's quite a dangerous intersection where elites still miss Colorado and people are worried what ingress and egress in Colorado, how the alley would work. And there's very little understanding of that in the survey.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Using SurveyMonkey, we had about 172 responses, which is a pretty good return from our neighborhood and 74% of the people. You can only vote once using a survey. 74% opposed, 26% voted not to oppose. In addition, we received around the hour and received 35 emails from Concerned Neighbors.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'We have no idea how many of those may have already voted in the survey though, so statistically I can't give you a number. All 35 of those emails that you got in the last few days were were opposed.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And so as a result of those things, we opposed to this particular rezoning amendment. And I can see the rest of my time to Doug if he needs it.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Though, you know, he considered the rest of his time to be a 42 seconds.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We finished the meeting last time with an attempt to solve it. The neighborhood came to us and said we could imagine a unit count that would have a three in front of it, which we assumed was 39. We asked them for one more unit 40.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That's what we agreed to try to get done. Unfortunately, as I indicated, when he took it back to the ward, it was not approved. So we do not have an agreement tonight. We tried. We still are very much desirous of this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We think it's an appropriate rezoning. RH three Is is the most appropriate zoning for the site. Single family housing is not it's not a it's on a state highway, 50,000 cars a day. Single families, houses do not make sense on this site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Any questions? Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just want to clarify that the garden court format is what was finally proposed that the developer is planning to move forward with. Is that accurate? If you could come forward and just clarify that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The conceptual plans that we showed to the neighborhood do tract the garden court form. We understand, based on the past hour, that there's certainly some division internally as to what that guard and court form should look like. We're cognizant of that.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But indeed that was the proposal conceptually garden court form on the on the property.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And it's 40 units. Is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Correct. We were willing to limit to 40 units.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Okay. And. There was somebody that talked about a covenant on the property that limited to the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Correct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'That somebody was me. And we are still willing to covenant from ourselves running with the property in favor of the Arno to never exceed 40 units on that side.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. So just to clarify. Mr. McKinnon, you said you offered 40 and the but the neighborhood was willing to take 39. No. Oh. Okay.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Clarified at the end of the meeting. We had asked for a proposal because it became very, very circular. We asked fundamentally from the from the neighborhood side, from their leadership, what would the unit count be that you could support?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And then the number that was proposed was a description of something with a three in front of it. Uh huh. Which we took to be 39. And Jay well he'll speak to we said, would you consider one more unit 40?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We shook hands at that with the understanding that the board leadership, the president and the head of the zoning committee were going to go back to see if they could get that approved. So we left the meeting optimistic that we were going to have a.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'The transaction that we could work with. Unfortunately, a couple of days later, the results of the vote came to us. No, no agreement.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. I have a few more questions in the garden court format, and I'm sure you were listening to our discussion. Can you just describe to us what the size is that the courtyard you were proposing if you had 40 units?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Yeah. Yeah. Our architects, certainly our architect, had proposed it consistent with with the code. So that is a minimum 15 foot entryway into it. The courtyard would expand once you're a little bit deeper to to allow for plantings and that kind of thing.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But it did not have a correlation that I believe is coming from the amendment, which is a correlation between the width of the courtyard to the height of the property. These were three storey buildings, so logically would be 35 to 36 feet.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But the concepts that we presented had a 15 foot respecting the code as it exists today.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. Okay. And it's my understanding on developments that are an acre or more that that drainage retention has to be built. Correct. Have you factored that into your site plan and that that is going to take.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We have it's complicated. As Councilman Sussman knows, this is a drainage drainage nightmare in the in the city. And President Clarke also spoke to some of the concerns about what travels to the plot and what doesn't. So, yes, our site plan would need to provide for on site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Retention that take away some of the available area for what you could build.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'No, not on the concept we presented.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then. Believe it or not, Colorado Boulevard is a parkway and there is a 20 foot parkway setback back and the right away limit is eight feet. So it actually. You can't have the building. Until the 29th foot from the curb of Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So that's set back pretty far.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Not only do we believe it, we've planned it that way.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And that still doesn't limit the number of units. No.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'That's the concept we present.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you. I have some questions for CPD. I. Teresa. Hi. So. In the staff report it one of the aspects of the gr3. It says it provides a transition to urban and urban edge. Mm hmm. And this neighborhood is.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Urban edge. It is an urban.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Hilltop is an urban edge. Well, that's how I was taking it with the issue zone district. That's okay in the neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then the height is 30 to 35 feet, which is the same height. Yes. Okay. And I blueprint Denver identifies it as an area of change and it says single family duplex. That includes a mixture of housing types, blah, blah, blah.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That includes duplexes, townhouses and small apartment buildings. But it says typical densities are between ten and 20 housing units per acre area wide. What's that mean?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It doesn't define the area. I don't think it means a specific property. If a blueprint was a citywide plan. Very rarely. Other than on the map. Did we? Discuss single properties, but.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. All right. Well, this property is about an acre, so that's why I brought that up. And then also consistent with Blueprint Denver area of Change Strategies, the grh3 zoning standards will require an orientation to the street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And so this proposal. The Garden Court is not oriented to the street.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'At least two of the in the garden court form. At least two of the doors have to be oriented to the primary street. The remainder of the doors can be oriented to the courtyard.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then another. Aspect of Blueprint Denver, it says building scale. That is the same as the adjacent area of stability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So can you address that? Well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We you just asked me that the 30 to 35 feet. That's the same height that the ESU de Zone District has. So it's the same height as being proposed for this property.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So when that says building scale, it's referring to height and not the density in blueprint.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Mm hmm. Can you read the sentence to me again, please?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'A building scale that is the same as the adjacent area of stability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess I'd have to read more of that, that paragraph. But typically in blue print, we are talking about both the scale and sort of intensity of development. So I would think it would mean either or both of those things.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. And then comp plan 2000. Says low scale multi-unit residential where services and infrastructure are already in place. It's an opportunity to add moderate density in a location that serves as a transition to both Carter Boulevard and the Cherry Creek neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I guess I'm just wondering with that what that term moderate density refers to.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Again, blueprint doesn't define, although it does define for single family duplex, that 10 to 20 dwelling units area wide. So in my mind, when I think of moderate density, I think about our old neighborhoods that are a mixture of single family, duplex and small apartment buildings as moderate density.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Okay. That's all I have for you. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilwoman Black. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem Teresa. I have a follow up question to Councilwoman Black's question on page ten of the staff report and blueprint. Denver is one of the criteria that we're evaluating this rezoning on and where it reads typical densities are between ten and 20 housing units per acre, area wide.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so area wide, you just said, is not defined. No. But even if it's not defined, it is the terminology area wide isn't defined. But when it says ten and 20 housing units per acre per acre is a definition.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yes. Okay. So Kylan actually is a good one to ask this follow up question because he sat down and did some math and we he came up with between three and four. Where do you go? Three and five dwelling units per acre, sort of area wide in the hilltop neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then he took a look at this property and the property to the north, both of which are the single family duplex along the edge of hilltop. And as I recall his numbers, he if 50 units were built on this property, then the density would be 19 dwelling units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that's his math. So I see you shaking your head, as Kyle said. So I guess my follow up question then is either Kyle or David Broadwell. Is Kyle Dalton's math going to be submitted into the public record?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Because really, all that I have in front of me to make a decision on is, of course, what you just told me. But then what has been has been documented. My understanding is no, the only thing submitted in the record is the answer to the question.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The staff report as written, is CPD's. Position. Okay. All right. Thank you, Teresa.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. Let's see. Let's start at an easy way. Doug, please. The parking you have planned for. Let's say you get 40 units. What kind of parking would we be with?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'As I mentioned, we proposed to put all of the parking for the project underground. Right. And leave that probably between 1.4 to 1.6 stalls per unit is going to make sense. There was a request from, I believe, our first meeting with the neighborhood to to do to commit and obligate ourselves to do two stalls per unit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we found that doubling the code requirement was, was not something that was appropriate for us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yeah, it's interesting. So we're we're trying to judge this on a plan from 2000 Blueprint Denver from 2002 and a Colorado Boulevard plan from 1991. And the Colorado Boulevard plan talks about that projects should park all the project needs on site.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So how you come up with a number for that is a little bit of a mystery. Thank you. Jane, please. So the the number with a three in front of it. Okay. The developer obviously would like to call that a 39.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I'm guessing you folks would like to call that a 31. If it were put in front of me. I'd assume something like 35. So it appears to me that we're talking about five units and I'm wondering if I'm close.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So, Councilman Cashman, we were in negotiations and not getting anywhere effectively. We were trying to take something that could at least be voted on that was different. And so we said, Well, let's try something with a three in front of it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The lower the number, the more likely that the are and maybe the neighbors would have been more aligned or, you know, voted.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'More heavily for.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Rezoning. You know, I was hoping for 32, something like that. You know, they couldn't budge off of 40. We agreed to take that back, telling them that we don't know how the board is going to vote on this, but at least we have something to talk about.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And when we didn't and we moved, we moved it out to the community as well.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. So you weren't coming forth with a preconceived number that your group had discussed and said, throw 35 at them. You were hoping to have something to keep the discussion moving along.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'No. And I can tell you now that I've got, you know, more than 200 bits of feedback, that the community seems very centered around the rowhouse part of this, part of the code or possibly townhouses or something along those lines.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Sure. With, you know, density in the mid-twenties. And that's where the community seems to be standing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. Teresa, please. So as Councilwoman Black and Councilwoman Gilmore mentioned, Blueprint talks about typical densities between ten and 20 housing units per acre. And so the word moderate rears its ugly head again, because in your staff report, you say the G-rated three zone district allows a moderate step up in density on the subject property.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Again, if I'm thinking moderate, I'm thinking 25, 30%. I'm thinking you get up around 60, 70%. We're getting extreme, which would make something in the 40 range more than moderate. So how is CPM?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I was interpreting that as height and intensity of use because in the description in Blueprint Denver of the family duplex, it talks about single family duplex townhomes and small apartment buildings.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Okay. So you are not talking about density in the form of.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Number of units.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Number of units.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I never know the number of units for sure.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So do we have other H3 developments?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We do. You asked this question, and.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'What I asked you earlier was, do do we know how many units per acre?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that would take some analysis that I didn't have time to do. And before I when you asked the original question this afternoon. So I was thinking maybe Boulevard one, but I pulled up the site plan there for the grade three area and they've combined it with the garden court that you're seeing is combined.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'They're using the Annex five zoning and the RH three zoning. And so it was hard to figure out, well, what's the density then of the area? That's the garden court. So that was the only thing I had time to pull up and didn't really.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Have any feeling at all for other multifamily developments of whatever. Zone zone district. But in, you know, row house form, you know, it's two, three stories.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'It it all depends on what the code allows. And typically are townhomes and row houses are that three story in my mind. Heights So again to me that's a fairly moderate height when some of our single family homes are allowed the same height.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sure. But I mean, as far as the density of units here, you're still normally.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It's.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ten, 20 units an acre. That's what we have. The only guide we have.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Back home I have absolutely no feel for. I'm sorry.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hmm. No, that's an important piece. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilwoman Kennish.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President, I. Well, I think I maybe will follow up with you, sir. I don't know if this is where Councilman Cashman was going, but I want to take us to the criteria. Yes, my question. So I don't know, Councilman Cashman, maybe not where your question is going to the uniformity of zone district question.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So to the extent that he's asking questions about other RH threes, how do you analyze the uniformity of district regulation and restrictions in it? There's very little in the staff report on that criteria. So I'm going to dig into a couple of these criteria more, but I want to understand how you analyzed that without looking at other'",
        "'speaker_11': 'RH threes.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I'm so sorry. So one of the first things we do when someone walks in the door and says, I want to rezone my property, is look at what does what our plan say, and then we try and translate what our plans say into a zone district that we think is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And some of the things we look at are what's what's what are the zone districts in the area. In this case, the RH three is across Colorado Boulevard in the Cherry Creek neighborhood. So one of the other things we look at is do they have the acreage to to rezone?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And in this case, because of the grade three, acreage wasn't an issue. So we do get an idea when we talk about zone districts, by looking at zone districts in the area of the property that's being proposed for rezoning and saying, okay, that gives us we take a look at those properties if they're built, that gives us'",
        "'speaker_4': 'an idea of what could be built here. But truly, in this case, it was the description in Blueprint Denver of what could be built matching up with the building forms allowed in this district.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you. And if I can just follow up on that point really quickly. It's a it's a high level look at uniformity are similar located parcels. It's not about what's actually built in RH.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Oftentimes we don't know what's going to be built. We didn't know if a duplex was series of duplexes or townhomes were proposed. And. So we don't know that.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. I just want to clarify. So there was an analysis of whether this parcel was being treated to similar parcels in terms of the zone district, but that's not looking at the level. Councilman Cashman wants to address what's actually built in.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'How does it compare? Because. All right, I think that's good. The other question I wanted to ask you is, is there anything else you want to say about the public health, safety and welfare criteria and how you approach that one?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Because this one was a little confusing to me. You basically said because it met a different criteria, it automatically met this one.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And well, this is one that I know the neighbors have written in their letter that we don't address safety because we don't address traffic. But it's another thing that we have no knowledge of because we don't know what's proposed to be built.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So if it was a townhome, it would be different traffic than if it was a duplex. Then it would be different traffic. If it's a garden court, then it would be different if it was a single family home.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. We take that if we are adhering to the plans that our citizens have written and council has approved, that we are adhering to the health, safety and welfare of the city.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And is that the same for most rezonings then? It's not a different analysis you've used on this parcel. No. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And I guess my other questions are for Doug macKinnon, please. Two questions. You've indicated that your plan requires ingress and egress from Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Do you have reason to believe that in later stages of review that that would necessarily be approved? Or is it that there is a process and the city will have decision making and and it may or may not be approved at a later point.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We are early on, approximately about six, six months ago, Councilman Kasich, we went to the city with initial dialogs about how could the site be connected to the arterials around it. So we did have a detailed dialog with traffic and transportation.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'They absolutely confirmed for us that Colorado Boulevard is absolutely the right ingress and egress. They had requested that that egress and ingress be pushed as far north as possible, and that's where we've oriented it on the northern boundary of the property.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you. Second question and I only have three, this one. You mentioned how your concept that you shared with the neighbors compared to our earlier discussion with regard to the walkway or the the the Court. Can you enlighten us on how your concept compares with the other two criteria?'",
        "'speaker_11': 'So are there units on all three sides in your design, correct? Yes. Correct. And are the units stacked or are they, in fact, row homes where if it's 35 feet, that that's one unit in the 35 feet?'",
        "'speaker_7': 'In our concept, they are stacked. The amendment that I heard tonight would change that requirement under the under the guard.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. So it's more like an apartment where floor floor one is unit one and floor two would be a separate unit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Think of them as flats.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Okay. Thank you. Last question. Would you care to share why you all couldn't live with a number that began with the three? We don't have to talk about what it was. But why? Why? Why did.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Your economics, pure economics, putting 100% of the parking underground a very expensive proposition.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Okay. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I'm going to sort of put a little on your words. This is not a different analysis. It's just the wrong analysis. And I'm going to go through it. Can you bring up the slide of the future land use map and Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Can anyone?'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Do we still have that Kelly or. Okay. I actually brought a copy because I.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Need I need to have it in order to explain why I was shaking my head so vehemently.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Can you give me a minute to load it?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Jasmine Espinosa, do you have other questions? Well, we're digging up that slide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So what was stated? So what it reads is that. So when you look at the map and hopefully they call it up, there are three shades of orange. I mean, two shades of orange and one shade of yellow.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The shade of orange is the middle shade, a peach shade where this property is located. And that is the area of change that is identified as single family duplex. That was the area that we were talking about in Blueprint Denver.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, I got to go find that language. Shoot.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I am actually looking at the staff report. Technically it is Page.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You're looking at the staff report, not the power.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Page 11. Yep.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But you can call up the PowerPoint because it's the same graphic. But where's.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The slide? Did you want to see?'",
        "'speaker_0': '10 to 20 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Language injustice.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Six.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Councilman, which side did you want to see?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The the future land use map and blueprint in Denver.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Okay. Why am I? So.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And because I needed you, Kyle had done an analysis. And this is this is crucial.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We don't have the full two blocks in this picture.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But no, but that's all that matters. Right. Is Kyle did what blueprint Denver is is it specifically states that the single family duplex is the area that is supposed to be the 10 to 20 units? He included the single family, which is a completely different area in an area of stability.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'To answer your.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Question, so let me walk everybody through. And because the the edges, the police, the the property across the street is urban residential. So you're taking the plan recommendation. I mean, the zoning of an urban of a completely different area in Blueprint Denver and applying it to a.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'No no those are three what I described was if I can use mine was the block that's being proposed for rezoning and the block north of that that are both single family duplex in blueprint Denver those are the two blocks that counted the number ran the numbers on and only those two half blocks and they border Colorado'",
        "'speaker_0': '. What we're saying is what's a you know let's talk about the appropriateness of the zoning, right. So what we're saying is because the applicant has stated that they could fit 60 units in this zoned district, the proposed zoned district, which would be 60 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And any place in that, if you make this change, you can make this same change anywhere in that single family duplex area, meaning that you're basically justifying 60 units per acre in the entirety of that area of change.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The zoning could mean based on those current single family zoning of that area, you could fit in 8 to 10 units, which is on the bottom end of the recommendation for that area. If you did a duplex at T you now you're at 16 to 20, which is directly in line with the plan recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What you're doing with this zoning district by taking a zone district across from across the street, which is an urban residential, is increasing the development potential to three times what is the recommendation of Blueprint Denver adjacent to an area of stability which is less than ten.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Mr. Dalton, would you? Councilman. Councilman Espinosa, we will have a chance for comments later. Do you have a question for anyone in there?'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I just you know, when we when we do these analysis, those colors mean something. And you're you said area wide and you started considering this in a in a far bigger context than what Blueprint Denver is doing. So maybe I didn't understand Mr. Dalton's math, and I apologize, Kyle, for the eminently shaking.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I have to think about what what precedent we're setting. And this is a considerably higher density units per allowable units per acre. If you started as and you like the plan recommendation is, then you could hit the desired recommended recommended unit density.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if I may, I mean, I don't hear a question there, but I'm the Kyle that folks are referring to. Kyle Dalton, Principal City Planner with Community Planning Development. And all I will say is that, well, what we looked at, just to clarify for the record, what we looked at is what blueprint Denver is saying about what'",
        "'speaker_0': 'it means to be single, family, duplex, residential. And and in this word area Y that we're hinging on is it's in there for a reason. And it's it's important it seems simple that it's one word, but it actually goes to the intent of Blueprint Denver and how it's used and how we use it in evaluating rezoning applications'",
        "'speaker_0': '. Right. Which is not mapped parcel by parcel, but what are you achieving in an area? What are you giving in a neighborhood, in a region of the city, etc.? So we looked at what would be different because it doesn't define area.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'We looked at what would be different ways to think about an area since it's within the single family duplex, residential classification we looked at, well, what if we included all of the land that is single family duplex, which is this half block and the one to the north.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'What would what would that look like? And that's where if they built 50 units and you look at the number on the ground today, it's still within that range of 10 to 20 acre wide. That's about existing units, not what's possible under the current zone district or under future districts.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I think all of this conversation is kind of points to what Teresa was saying early, over and over again, which is that it's hard to say because you don't know how many units there are, how many people may build next door under their zoning, or if they were to rezone someday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so again, on the totality of the recommendation, that's how we found it, consistent with single family duplex. But but now I want to I finally found the language so directly verbatim from the blueprint Denver Single Family Duplex.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Residential areas are moderately dense areas that are primarily residential but some complimentary small scale commercial uses. There is a mixture of housing types, as you stated before, single family housing, duplex townhouses and small apartment building. The typical densities are between ten and 20 housing units per acre area wide.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Again, we're talking about the single family duplex residential area. In the single family, detached structures often predominate. So not I mean, this is in the definition of that land use, the future land use for that area. I don't know.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I mean, each area has its own similar write up. And so if it means area wide, it should indicate that it's talking about that in all adjacent areas. But we're talking this is specific language to that area of single family duplex, residential, which is that band.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And so it's so I just wanted to make that, that clear because I, I really. This is a incredible uptick in unit density that speaks to that other stuff, but that's a different matter. Thanks.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. I just have one question for the developer, and that is regarding access. How would people get into the development from South bound Colorado? Because there's a raised median all the way down to lead style and there's no turn at Ellsworth to get into the alley.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'How do people access this coming from the north? If they're councilman, I believe if they're only on Colorado Boulevard itself, headed south, but want to get into the property, they would move down to past either Bayard or late Steele and turn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But from leech they all they're going to how they're going to get into your project. That's a protected left turn right there. Right, but they'd be on lead still. You're suggesting that they turn. They they may well circle as a U-turn or they would be coming.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'If they're south, south bound, they may well recognize that moving on to Bayard is a more appropriate way to come into the property and moving eastward on Bayard Northern Colorado Boulevard eastward into the property. Again, they get to Bayard by means of several opportunities.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'First Avenue, First Avenue, multiple opportunities exist. Okay. All right. Thank you. That's all.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn. All right. I see no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 249 is now closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Sussman.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I didn't have any questions because I know a lot about this project and this neighborhood and this and the way in which this site looks and. I do want to thank the planners for the very careful consideration they gave of this.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And I know that you were looking at neighboring projects and trying to make the best of, you know, what could possibly go here. So I do want to thank you for your hard work. And I guess it was very fortunate that you all heard the conversation about garden carts, homes and the difficulties that there are and the'",
        "'speaker_5': 'ways in which it has been used that were probably not the original intention of a garden cart home. And it certainly is a garden cart form and it certainly is something that we need to look at again. But that's coming down in the future.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'That's not coming down tomorrow, that's not going to happen tomorrow, that we're going to limit the size of garden carts. So. This is a difficult decision because it's a difficult site. And there's no agreement and no covenant. And so I have to make my decision based on what is possible on this side.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'How many? Apartments, could there be given the garden cart form? And that what we heard tonight was probably 54, maybe a little bit more. I heard the number 54. But knowing this site, the way I do it, I have walked it and, you know, have adventures on that bad street, which many of us have.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We have a site that has very. Awkward ingress and egress it it's at that corner of the lead stale bad Colorado Boulevard that is generally a nightmare in the city knows we have to do something about that intersection good development there might help us leverage some of that but but I do mean good development we have an'",
        "'speaker_5': 'alley that's it's confusing about whether it is an alley. Whose alley what private alley what not private alley. And we have a Bayard Street that we're not too sure is a street. Certainly wasn't in some original plats but now is a as you know is a one way because you can't fit two cars on it.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'It's a one way part of the way, except for those who know when to. Disobey the law and get up there when you have to. But certainly I never do that. So it's it's just the most unusual sort of configuration of a site and thinking about what could be possible and the number of units on that site'",
        "'speaker_5': 'make me really think that it it does have implications for the health, safety and welfare of this community that. You know, we're not supposed to talk about transportation or mobility, but we can't worry about health, safety and welfare.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Of this site. In the possible amount of numbers that could be on this site. And because that's the only. Thing I have to go on is how many could you build? I would have to vote against this zoning and will urge my council members to do the same.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Norman Sussman And if I could ask everyone in the chamber to please hold your applause until we get to the end so that we do respect that there are two public hearings following this, and we want to get through as expeditiously as possible.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I apologize to both sides actually for not having moved my own measure on the garden court sooner, since I've been opining it for 12 months. Because I think if we had addressed the capacity and density of these forms, we're probably having a different discussion here today.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But that's why that covenant was crucial. Absolutely crucial because the the form allowed in that you see in this zone district that being proposed is allows densities that far, far surpass any planning recommendation that we have. And, you know, putting a covenant that that restricted, that limited that would bring that zone district, the proposed own district.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'It doesn't bring the district in line, but it brings the development potential in line with the plan recommendations. Ideally, we would be talking about some modified zone district to capture this this density, the density that is consistent with the plan.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But unfortunately, that's not what the applicant put forward or carried to this council. They brought forward a clear RH three without any restrictions, and that has that has allowances for this level of density that is incompatible, incongruent and not supported or by the plan recommendation.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So. In. Clearly, it's adjacent. It's you know, when we're talking about this adjacency to an area of stability, this sort of addressing this sort of concern is is pivotal. This is probably going forward, going to be addressed in a future plan update.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I would be curious to see where we end up. But as it's written today, that is a single family duplex recommendation, a 10 to 20 units per acre area and 40 means 54 to 60 units per acre.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Is, is, is just it it's just inconsistent. Mean. It's a it's just. It just does not meet that criteria. And and so for that reason, I cannot support allowing a zone district that is that incongruent with our plan recommendations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So I also will be not supporting this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem I council members Sussman and Espinosa spoke to some of what I wanted to say. But but I also do not believe that the criteria have been met. I disagree respectfully with CPD. I don't believe that it's consistent with the comp plan in several respects.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We do want to promote infill development in Denver and this is obviously it's a vacant church. It's a site that needs infill. But that doesn't mean that any rezoning will be the appropriate zoning. I don't believe that this is appropriate.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'One of the things we look for is infrastructure that is adequate to serve the new density that's been proposed. And I believe, in fact, the infrastructure here is lacking, particularly for the street system, as Councilwoman Sussman pointed out.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And I don't think it's appropriate to tell people coming from the North that they should turn it First Avenue and cut down Albion Street through the neighborhood for several blocks to get to go around a backyard and come back around to their front door and Colorado Boulevard.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'This site is uniquely handicapped, I think, by the UN's what I consider to be a long have considered to be an unsafe situation where Leach Dale and Bayard and Colorado Boulevard come together. And so I think it's lacking in that respect and is not consistent with the comp plan.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'We want to encourage infill that is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood. And as Councilman Espinosa pointed out, I don't think that this is the right zoning. There needs to be a rezoning here, but not to this not to this particular category.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And the Boulevard Plan, which is quite old, 91, I think it was 1991, but it says that development should that that should improve traffic flow and safety. And I don't believe that making U-turns at Colorado and Leach Dale improves traffic flow and safety.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we should ensure that new development has little or no adverse impacts on adjacent uses. And I believe that this does because of its unique location, at a very troublesome spot on Colorado Boulevard. So for that reason, I and I do do not support this.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem, I want to first say that I apologize that I missed the first public hearing on May 23rd, but have been advised by the city attorneys that I can still vote on this if I have reviewed the video of the hearing and all of the evidence in the record prior to casting my'",
        "'speaker_4': 'vote. And so I went back and I rewatched everything and we reviewed everything. And, you know, there are two issues around the review criteria that I'm uncomfortable with, the consistency with adopted plan, specifically blueprint. Denver I only can make my decision based upon the evidence that is presented before me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And what I have here is typical densities are between ten and 20 housing units per acre area wide, and that is what I have to go off of. And so with that one, I don't think that this meets that criteria.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And then secondly, the, you know, furthering public health, safety and welfare, you know, the ingress and egress. And what really hit me is I have a 17 year olds who's trying to learn how to drive. And I can never in good faith tell anybody that the way you're going to get into or out of a neighborhood is'",
        "'speaker_4': 'you're going to have to flip a U-turn. I just from that standpoint, I think that that's a huge infrastructure issue around public health, safety and welfare. And then my second point to that is in my community of Montebello, we have a very, very large apartment building that is, you know, has always had problems with crime.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if you look at that structure, they jam packed people into it. And then when there were issues with the surrounding neighborhood, the powers that be thought that it would be great to put a wrought iron fence around the outside.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so essentially you're trapping people into an area and it is too dense to accommodate the furthering of public health, safety and welfare. And so based on those two right review criteria that I don't feel that it meets, I will not be supporting this rezoning.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Black.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Thank you, Mr. President. As I said at the hearing, we had in May. I really do believe that density belongs on Colorado Boulevard. Much of Denver was built. I don't know if it was intentionally, but we have huge commercial corridors and they backup to neighborhoods all over our city.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hampton, Colorado Boulevard. My whole district is like that. Evans University, much of our city, Southwest, Denver. And consistently, the people who live in the houses closest to the commercial corridors, they are consistently unhappy. So I just sort of want to acknowledge that it's it's rough living being the the streets that live closest to Colorado Boulevard or to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hampton. I actually live close to both of them and get to listen to them a lot. But. In May. I was going to support this because I'm involved in a similar rezoning on Colorado Boulevard near my own neighborhood, and it is for a suburban context, and it's townhomes.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'The difference here is that the garden court are not allowed in the suburban context, and so there is not a chance that there would be much greater level density or something that is equivalent to an apartment building. Another difference is in my district.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There aren't challenging street configurations. I appreciate what Councilwoman Gilmore said about her kids and what Councilman Flynn said. Quite frankly, when I heard that someone wanted to build density in on that lot, it's so challenging. I can't imagine not that I'm a developer, but if I was, that wouldn't be the place.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I would choose to do that. I just think it's such a challenging lot. As we all know, Denver is growing, traffic is increasing. I talked to our traffic engineers today, 58,000 cars a day going down Colorado Boulevard. And I, I don't believe that having a hundred units on that lot is really going to change the traffic on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Colorado Boulevard. So I'm not buying that argument, but I do think there are huge challenges of how you would get in and out of that, and I question the safety of it. I also found out how many accidents are on that corner.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'There are about 28 years since 2009, and it's almost double what the typical number of accidents are on that similar kind of roadway. And I think that speaks to the safety of that corner. So my concerns, as I said, are the safety related to the access and then also to some of the criteria.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I do again, I do think density does belong on Colorado Boulevard. But the one part that I read of Blueprint Denver that says 10 to 20 units per acre, clearly this is not 10 to 20 units. The orientation to the street.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I totally get the garden court problem. It's it's a problem. We're talking about it. And then again, the scale and intensity to the adjacent area of stability. And then also, I don't know that 40 units is moderate density on an acre lot.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'I've been there many times. I've driven down Colorado Boulevard hundreds of thousands of times in my lifetime. I know it well. I don't know if that meets the criteria either. So I have changed my mind and I will not be supporting it tonight.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, I just. I don't know why I got fixated on the word congruent, which is not the right word. I mean, there's not a congruency requirement. And so I just want to stress that. But essentially what every time I said congruent, I was basically trying to say when I was saying incongruent, I said I was meaning that'",
        "'speaker_0': 'does not meet the criteria. And so I want to be I want to simply say that this rezoning, this proposal in district does not meet the criteria. I want to make that very clear because got fixated on that word and kept using it.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'But I meant to speak to the criteria. And so I want to be clear.'",

The families and community members in and this is all one community in the Barnum Park neighborhood began the process of renaming these parcels, distributing and circulating'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the petitions. And we were fortunate enough to witness the results of those. Let me say a word or two and a you've received the memos that I sent for both individuals, but I would like to take a moment to say something about each one of these individuals.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me start with Ruth. Better known as Lucille Drilling, who is a long time resident of Barnham West neighborhood. I think she came there in the 1960s, and it was her efforts that really led to the creation of Weird Gulch Park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And, you know, Ruth was one of those people that when you called, people answered, whether you were a neighborhood person, a Boy Scout or a council member or ahead of a department in city hall, she she was truly a force of nature.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it was her single mindedness about transforming what really was just a ditch where people thought they should ditch their trash, in fact, into something better. She had a vision for that area. That is what we it is transformed today and what we hope will continue to happen into a beautiful, natural area in park that serves the'",
        "'speaker_4': 'community that she so loved. And so in 1972, where Gulch Park became a reality and it really was thanks to her tenacious efforts to get that done. And she remained an advocate, so she never stopped it. It was named a park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And that wasn't good enough. She wanted to make sure it was the best park and that it was well maintained and that people used it and so on. So she remained a real champion and advocate for this park until her passing in 2008.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Let me move on for a moment to someone who really was a mentor for me. Emil Sam Sandoz. Councilman Sanders was serving on this council when I was just a pup, along with my former colleague, Councilwoman Ortega. And we we were serving as aides along with our friend Ramona martinez, who served with Sam.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he taught us an awful lot about not about city government. We learned a lot about city government, but what he taught us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Was.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'About community. What he taught us was how to respond and how to use the energy and the commitment from people in a neighborhood to make changes in the community that they wanted to see happen. And so he was a lifelong resident of the Villa Park neighborhood and served on this council in Council District three from 1975 to'",
        "'speaker_4': '1987. He started so many programs to serve the community that there are too numerous to mention. I know that many of you and many folks in the city have participated in in the annual holiday.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Drive.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'That that continues to this day. And it's something that Sam started the Hispanic annual salute. Again, another extraordinary event that helps support our young students and their dreams for college. And that continues today. Thanks to the efforts of his family, which have carried it out.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So. Over over 700 signatures were obtained on both of the petitions for the renaming of these.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Parks.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And letters of support poured in, including from Councilman Lopez, who really was a champion and continuing on in the tradition of Admiral Sam Sanders responding to the needs of his community and helping them to bring this forward. This evening, I'm going to.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Let you hear the.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Details from the people who will speak this evening. But after a public hearing on Thursday, April 4th, between the Parks and Recreation Advisory Board, where we heard some of the passionate stories you're going to hear a little bit tonight, the the Parks and Rec Advisory Board voted unanimously to recommend that.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Barnum North.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Park be renamed M.L. Sam Sanders Park and that the Weir Gulch be renamed for Ruth Lucille Drilling. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. We have seven individuals sign up to speak this evening on Council Bill 473. I'm going to call the first five speakers and I do apologize if I say your name incorrectly when I call your name. If you could make your way up to the front bench, that will help speed up our proceedings.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So the first five are Bill drilling, Paul Santos, April Crumley, Ethel Santos and Tim Santos and Mr. Darling. Bill Darling, you're up first.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you. My name is Bill Rowling, and I'm here. I'm going to wing this because I didn't write anything up. When my parents moved to that gulch. In late 1959, I was just a youngster. And I remember that ditch being full of weeds, ten foot deep marsh machines in their cars, garbage cans, tires, everything you could think'",
        "'speaker_8': 'of. And my mom pursued and she had us boys over there working, cutting weeds after we cleaned up our own yard, which the home had been repossessed. And we picked it up. But. We worked and worked on that park for many years, and she just was totally avidly after the city.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Constantly, every mayor, every councilman she could get her hands on, she would take them a cake or whatever she could do to even talk to them, you know. But in a way, I loved my mother and I think she really deserves this.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I hope you all can see it our way. And I want to thank everyone from the drilling family and the Santos family for being here tonight. This is just a great honor for all of us and for her.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I know she'll be up there smiling if it passes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Paul Santos? Yes.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Hi, I'm Paul Sanders. And a wonderful find Duluth roots drilling. In 1972, I was a sophomore down the street at Denver West High School. I just learning to drive. And my father had us involved in any kind of political campaign you could imagine.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Roots, of course, was quite a bit older than I, and I was just a young kid. And she turned to me after everybody got picked for all of the coal jobs and said, You know what, we have to flip pancakes for over 400 people.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'That's like a thousand pancakes. Are you up to the task? And she immediately told me how she was not a show horse, she was a workhorse and that I was, too. I took a love to Ruth and told her that I had just been jilted by my girlfriend at high school.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And so she made me the very first pancake I'd ever seen with a mickey Mouse sign. And she put little you got it right, the blueberries for the eyes and the whole body. And she cheered me up every campaign from Senator Wirth, Pat Schroeder.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I was always picked to work with, really. So we became very close when she started to work on the on going. Of course, I had my new car, which is an old car for a kid on. I love that car.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'But she convinced me I needed to put this old mattress in the back of that trunk and take things over. Ruth drilling. She was an amazing lady. I always wanted to marry her. I'll be honest with you. I was a young cow.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I got as close as I could to Ruth driving. And my wife Crystal is here to attest to that. Thank you to Ruth has worked tirelessly for for Denver and for our website for your time.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, April Crumley.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hello.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'April Crumley, 215 South King Street in Barnum. Lucille was a big driving force in Barnum. And this is such a great honor that we're doing two individuals, Lucille and Sam, together. She used to tell me how they would pull things out of the garbage, shopping carts and tires and bicycles.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And towards the later years, she'd sit there on the porch and applaud, you know, work more, work more. But she never as happy said she never stopped with her political affiliations. And I think she stopped in front of your office with her big car, my house, and laid on the horn.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'My house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I had your.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'House, too.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, I was in your office and she had something to report and something to drop off. And I go, What is this, curb service? And she was she had porch meetings, current events. She started the transplant program season, the transplant program through Denver Urban Gardens.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'She started planting marigolds along the gold and Weir Gulch is this strange thing that runs through our neighborhood. And I've often said it's one letter away from weird.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'You know, when you find kids playing in it, I go, you find something alive and you can play in it. It's that simple, you know? So she was always an advocate for getting politicians involved. At her funeral, she had a pickle recipe.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'The family had done a pickle recipe with the notice, and someone was saying that they needed help in heaven making dill pickles. But there were so many politicians there and speaking that you wondered how the government survived that day because they were all at her funeral.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Weird Gulch is an open drainage ditch and it's now beautiful Green Parkway, thanks to Lucille Drilling and others. And thank you for considering both these good people.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Ethel Santos.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now I'm going to tell you how it all came about, because it was my husband, Sam Santos, that we went. He was just barely elected and we didn't know diddly about city works or anything else. He had gotten into this job because he thought he could help more people if he did it well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We went to the Concerned Citizens for Barnum meeting. Well, who did we meet there? But Lucille Drilling and her neighbor and little German lady that spoke very poor English. And the two of them tore into Sam like, you know, on an ape.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But they wanted that gulch cleaned up right now. And I mean, they demanded. And so Sam thought he had to do it himself. He didn't know that, you know, you can call city services and they would do this sort of thing.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But anyway, he got his friend Joe Lucero with a great big truck and all of our many sons. And every Saturday they cleaned the girls. And so they finally, when they would get down to the end, which is where the Sandoz part started in, we were in the gully, and by then we had it all together and'",
        "'speaker_4': 'the kids would all have hot dogs and they didn't mind working and helping. So anyway, that's how the girls finally started getting cleaned up. But then Sam started to get a little bit wise too, and knew that he could ask for help and get it.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So now, like the lady just said, it's a beautiful park. There is the the playground for the children and Lucille drilling. See, I love her to death. And so she would sit on her porch and she would admire all that stuff.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And if anybody was hanging around the kids playground, she ran them off. I mean, it was just the way it was. And she took care of it. And if anybody never came to mow the lawn or tram or whatever, she was on the phone to City Hall and she would walk into to Hickenlooper's office with a red'",
        "'speaker_4': 'velvet cake. And when she came out, she was getting done what she wanted to get done. So at her funeral. Hickenlooper was there. He was mayor at the time. And he and I both promised her that we would see that that park was named after her and Vine, that it's being done.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And God bless you, Lucy. And just to enjoy what you got that you did for us. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Next up, Tim Sandoz. And while Mr. Sandoz is working his way up, I'll call the last two speakers. You can work your way to the front bench. Erica Pollen and Debbie trailing.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council. My name is Tim Sandoz, and I live in Centennial, Colorado. Looking forward to moving back in Denver when we get the affordable housing done so I can afford to live here again.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I really want to pick up where my mother left off about Mrs. Driving because to us when we were younger, she was Mrs. Dry Lang. We were raised that way. But one of the things that we learned about Mrs. Driving is the drive that she had and Poppa learned how to work within city government.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And all of us did, in fact, as a result of a lot of Lucille's drive and say Mama said, Papa didn't know that you could find resources to do the cleaning, so we did it ourselves. But then he was able to learn how to develop the summer youth employment programs, to bring young people to be able to'",
        "'speaker_8': 'do that work and to better the community. Help them to learn about the legacy of creating a better community that you live in. Now I'm going to ask you to keep that word, legacy in mind as we go through the evening.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Ruth's legacy was We Are Gulch, and it started out just looking at how we changed the appearance. It was used as a trash dump. So how do we clean it up? How do we make it more palatable for the people in the neighborhood?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Once that was completed, she was kind of like the movie Lilies of the Field, you know? And he got one job done. Then she would, okay, but now we have to do this. And so was Ruth trailing Drive.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'The next thing that happened was one of the least sexy projects that any council member will ever have to deal with. And each and every one of you, I'm certain, will deal with it at some point. And that was the urban drainage portion.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You see, the culverts were so small and everything was backing up and all the neighbors homes and it was just a mess every time you had a heavy snow or a heavy rain. So once the gulch was cleaned up, the next step had to be, how do we address the flooding in people's homes?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thus we are goals project was created. It was my father's first major project as a member of the Denver City Council and he would not have gotten the support that he had from his colleagues without the drive of Lucille Drilling.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Now, I don't suggest anybody just take up red velvet cakes as a way to negotiate getting things done. That was one of her many ways, but she was very convincing, made sure everybody participated and then protected and nurtured that park to become a park later on.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'We'll talk a little bit later about the funding of these things, because that was created in 72. But much of the funding did not come for generations later until 1989. So Ruth was a mentor to all of us.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'She helped me, my father and others understand what city government should be doing for its people, and the naming of this park is extremely well deserved. Thank you so much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Erika Pilon.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Hi. Forgive me if my voice shakes. Some Erika pile on from Firestone, Colorado. I am one of the grandchildren of Lucille Driving or Granny D, as we called her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And as a.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Child I.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Remember going to her house.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And playing at that park and playground. I don't ever remember there being anything there other than a playground that we were able to play in because she created it. I remember catching crawdads with my brother and being able to be safe in that area because of her.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We cleaned up trash.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And she taught us to clean up trash because that's the right thing to.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Do. And that's what you do. When there's a mess, you clean it up. And the biggest thing that we learned is what it means to speak up for your community. And so now that I live in Firestone, we speak up for our community all the time and we're on our way boards and things because it's important to'",
        "'speaker_5': 'speak up for your community and to have a part in your community. I can take my own children. My own children played over there. My Uncle Irv still lives in her house. And so to be able to go over there and visit and have my children have play on the same playground I was able to play on'",
        "'speaker_5': 'and be safe is a really lasting legacy. And I speak for all her grandchildren that I can't tell you how many times we heard you better get this park named for me. Like, don't forget to get this park named for me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so I don't know what will happen if this doesn't happen.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I just urge you on behalf of her whole family that you would name this park in her honor and.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Such a lasting.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Legacy that she's left in all of us her first great, great, great, great grandsons in the room as well.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And just such a legacy that she's left.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'In all of us to teach us what it means to be a part of your community. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. And last up, Debbie dryly.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Yeah, my name's Debbie. Debbie dribbling. And Ruth was my mother in law for over 40 years. So I came into the family in 1967. They had moved in there in late 59, early 60. So much of it was cleaned up by the time I became part of the family.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But every weekend that was part of our duties was to come over and help clean up. And I don't know if you ever heard the word bigot. When's the last time you heard the word bigot? We heard it every weekend.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Trash begets trash. Let's get it cleaned up, because if we don't get it cleaned up, there will be more next week. Trash begets trash. And it was true. You know, if we were busy for a week and we came back the next time, there'd be more trash.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'There were shopping carts and tires and washing machines. I mean, it was unbelievable. Rats. I mean, it was it was disgusting. There was no place for children to play. So by the time my children were born, they were able to play there.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And it gives me great happiness to see my grandchildren play on those playgrounds that she worked so hard to put together. We've been friends with the Sanders family all those years. You know, she met Sam when he was the councilman and she, you know, browbeat him into helping her with the park.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But, you know, we've been lasting family, friends. We've always worked on the Christmas baskets with them, you know, wonderful projects to do with them, you know, great for family friendships. I would like and I know, you know, you guys are here really late tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I don't want to keep this too long. We can go on and on and on about it. But I would like to ask everybody in favor of Lucille Drilling Park. Please stand up. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions? Questions from members of council. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Where is my red velvet cake?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, any other questions? At the public hearing for council bill 473 is closed. Comments by members of Council. First up, Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I am very proud to sit here on this dais in front of my community and see this come up in front of us, on our screen, on our desk, and to be able to vote on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'I. We were ready to do this when she was still alive. Unfortunately, the rules in our city force us to wait seven years. And every single year we made sure this was on our radar screen. And when that year came up, when that September came up, we were ready to go clipboards.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Pens. Everybody ready? And knocked on those doors. It is unfortunate that well, I guess the only thing that I that I resent is that she is not here to see her flowers while she is still alive. She really clean that not just the the the the gulch shop, but our neighborhood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's that kind of civic participation, that insight and that inspires everybody else to do it. When you when I say legendary district three, you know, we play around as the front door to Denver and somebody else has the highest point in Denver, the heart of Denver or whatever we say, legendary district three.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And we say that because of people like with driving and because of people like Councilman Sanders. But Ruth was amazing. Come into the office. And she always had a presence to her. She knew she owned that office. She knew when she would walk in there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Red velvet care. Cake or not that. She'd get what she needed done. Not out of fear, not out of some ego trip, but out of love. It was infectious. It was. You'd catch it right away. She'd look at you with her eyes and.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And sometimes I think maybe it was just me, but she looked at me like she would look at you and you couldn't avoid staring at her eyes. You have them and I could see them right now. And they made you feel like you did something wrong or you were an idiot.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And I felt like I did something wrong. But no, no. She just was serious. And she had this sense of integrity. She had this sense of courage. She was true grit. But just surrounded with love. Everybody in the neighborhood respected her.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And not not for something that was born out of ego, but for just straight an aura of respect for this woman. She would have these neighborhood meetings in her driveway. Everybody would be there. The governor would be there, the mayor would be there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The mounted patrol, which I had no idea we had until it was at her meeting. You had the Jimi Hendrix of accordion players who lived in our council district, right? They'd come and I'd say Jimi Hendrix, because they would play an accordion and they'd get on the floor and do this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The only thing that needed to be done was the light, the accordion on fire when they were playing it. But that was Ruth trailing. And it was the donuts, it was the coffee, it was the music. It was the fact that you join that neighborhood association to be part of something great and positive, not to be something'",
        "'speaker_3': 'negative. Not to say, well, not in my backyard, but to say yes, let's do it. Starting with this. Got you first. And she would hand you that rake that broom. Well, this gulch had been it currently no name except for the Weird Gulch.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And only because the guy who owned the plot of land. Right. This park because it's always been a park. And when even before, when the city wouldn't consider it a park, it is a park and is a park.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because of where? Because of Lucille driving. And her work and what she stood for. And so today with her family here, you could, you know, dedicate that in her memory and in her honor. And every single kid, every single family, every single pet that's on a leash or walks through that park will be walking through Lucille Ruth'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Training Park. From here on out and let there be a heck of a lot more of that. So it's with great pride and honor that I ask my colleagues to support this renaming, long overdue renaming for this park in her honor.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Guzman-Lopez Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem. I think, Councilman Lopez, if anybody is intending on voting no, we should subject them to accordion music. There's a I think there's nothing would get me to give you what you want faster than to get that recording and music to stop.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'But.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But I just want to honor Lucille for reawakening the. The knowledge of our cultures that they are not garbage pits that the South Platte River once was. They are not places to dump things. They are assets in the community.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we on the West Side, we we love our water courses all the way from Bear Creek, West Harbor Gulch, Sanderson Weir, even Lakewood and Dry Gulch as they kind of define the West Side. And to see them change over the years, from garbage dumps to assets to playgrounds to places where you can actually go and enjoy'",
        "'speaker_7': 'your community is just it's remarkable. And it's it's much more than fitting that that we that we all vote yes on this. Mr. President, I will proudly vote yes. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Kinney.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to say that that is one of the sweetest public hearings I have been a privilege to hear in my time in office. I am so thankful for all of you for coming out.'",
        "'speaker_11': 'And what an amazing way to bring government and people and public spaces and history all together. Thank you so much. And I will be very happy to support this tonight. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. I'll just add before we vote here that our waterways in Denver have been so neglected and abused and forgotten, whether it's the South Platte River, the Bear Creek or the Cherry Creek or Weird Gulch and really.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'What has happened to reclaim them is this story. And it's what inspired me in a different version to do the work that I've done my whole life and to be sitting here tonight. And so I'm so excited and thrilled to be able to vote, to put this name on this park so that every single one of us'",
        "'speaker_2': 'will always be reminded that really one person can completely change their community. One person can turn something that's a trash dump into something that's a treasure. One person can create a space for kids to catch crawdads. Memories that they will take with them for the rest of their life and challenge all of us every time we are'",
        "'speaker_2': 'in this space to say, what is that space that still has trash? And how do we how do we take that next step and and live up to this legacy from legendary District three? So I'm very excited to be able to support this site.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And with that. Madam Secretary, roll call.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Lopez. I knew Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Absolutely no.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'Black eye. Espinosa. Flynn, I. Gilmore. Cashman. I can eat. Mr. President.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results tonight. Tonight, accountability for 37 has passed. Councilman Cashman, will you please vote council bill 474 on the floor for final passage?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Yes, Mr. President. I move the Council Bill 474 be placed upon final consideration and do pass.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has been moved and seconded. The one hour courtesy public hearing for Council Bill 474 is open. We have seven individuals signed up to speak this evening on Council Bill 474. Just like before I called the first five speakers.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'When I call your name, if you can make your way up to the bench. First up, we have Joanne Phillips, Debbie Drilling, Bill Drilling, Paul Santos and Tim Santos. And Joanne Phillips, you're up first.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'And so we had a Franjo Lucero. He said, Joanne, you got to come down and you have to work on this program. I says, What is this that's just come down and let's see what's going on? I says, okay.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'So it was the Sam Sanders District three Christmas basket program. And so I started in 1982. It's been a long it's still going this now, but I don't remember when it really started. But anyway, so I started with that, started working with Councilwoman Martinez.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Now this is 1982. This is when you had typewriters, you had you didn't have all these fancy computers. So we we had cards because we worked with Social Security, social services to make sure that everybody got a basket and they didn't get populated with because everybody called for basket.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Every they called everybody for a basket. So we would have to write they had to write these cards out. We had to have people in the community actually took phone calls, said, hey, I need a basket. This is where I live.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'This is, you know, whatever, my fellow. This is how much I make. This is how many kids that we had that we have in the household, how to feed. And then once we got that all cleared up, then we had the day that the baskets were going to be put together.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Everybody helped. The Sanders boys went and got all the food, which I was Sarah And then they then they packaged them together. And then on a Saturday morning, we got up quite early and we distributed all this. And then we also at that time, if there was some people that couldn't come to deliver it or come to'",
        "'speaker_4': 'pick it up, we had people that would deliver it. So that was, you know, we had a lot of people, we had the firemen, we had the police, we had public works because we had to have some of the dumpsters to throw some of the the boxes out from that we had used to put all the produce'",
        "'speaker_4': 'in. So this was quite an event. And it was, you know, it's one of those things where that the way it started, because Sam had such a big heart and people would come to him and they didn't have any money for food they didn't have, especially in the holidays.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so that's how I believe he started doing this. And one of the things is that he was always he said, Joann, don't you know? I says, you know, other people always talk about their program, says Joann. That's all right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He says, I'm doing this for the community. That's who Sam Sanders is. He does what he has done is done for the community. So after that, I sort of stayed with him. We did. We did things together in the community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He would call me. We come over, we talk about stuff that was going on. And Sam works almost 24 hours a day, 24, seven. There would be nights I would get a call, maybe about nine or 930, and Sam would call me and he'd just start talking about something that was going on.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I go, Sam, do you know what time it is? It's like, Oh, okay, but let me finish this. And I go, Okay. So that's how hardworking he is. Man had courage. He loved he loved his community. He'll have God, his community, his family and his community.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He was a member in presentation church. He sang. He was always involved with that. And then when he'd be so this is how I know Sam. And I just want I'm so proud that something is is going to be named after him, especially the Barn and Park North, which is in Villa Park, even though it says Barn'",
        "'speaker_4': 'and Park, it is in the Villa Park area. So it all used to be Villa Park between sixth Avenue came along Sixth Avenue divide at that. So we have Villa Park on one side and Barnum on the other side, but Barnum North, it's always been called Barnum North, so it's really great to have this name after Sam'",

        "'speaker_8': 'For most of my adult life in Denver, public schools as well. Who is my Sam Sanders and why is he deserving of this park naming? Manually Sam Sanders was born in Denver, Colorado on June 16th, 1927, the son of a Greek coal miner and a Hispanic mother.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He was a lifelong resident and community leader in Denver's West Side. In 1941, you do the math. Now we know that in World War two, the age for induction was dropped to 16, but Sam was 14. In 1941, he lied about his age and joined the Army's 82nd Airborne as a paratrooper.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He sustained crippling injuries at the Battle of the Bulge, resulting in several decorations for valor, including the Purple Heart and Silver Star. While recuperating, he met and married Ethel Mae McCants, and they raised nine children in the Villa Park and Barnum Park neighborhoods.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'They built a home in Villa Park where they raised their children and sheltered 14 foster children over the course of 40 years. Sam served on a plethora of boards and committees. His love of the Airborne Rangers and the military led him to be part of the American GI Forum.'",

        "'speaker_8': 'And those incessant calls that come at all the wrong time and the doorbell being rang all at the wrong time. We shared our father with his constituents. Thank you for considering him for this.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Tim Sanders.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Members of council. I'm going to go to the next page, which is actually a very telling page. It was my father walking with young people, leading a march back when they were much more militant.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Young people were getting their voice, and it was the first time that they felt that they had an opportunity to talk about their culture, their people, where they're at. So you see the picture there of my father looking like the gruff man he used to be at times with a cigaret in his mouth.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'At that time. What he was doing is helping young people understand how they could be a part of their community. They could express their voice. Unfortunately, during these times, he had to be there because many times people were attacked and he was there to protect the young people to ensure that there was safety.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So I'm here to talk about the community activists and commitment to children and families that this picture portrays, but as it's specific to what was part of their culture, what we used to call the goalie at the time.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Why did they decide to work on the Gulf to change the environment? Well, my brother mentioned that I've got seven brothers, two sisters, 14 foster brothers and sisters. Quite frankly, we needed some place to play. And so I also want to recognize, because we're speaking about my father in such eloquent terms, that it was really my mother'",

        "'speaker_8': 'It was really creating a quality of life for the kids in the neighborhood and giving us an opportunity, some place not only to play, but to be proud of. So we combine that with the Mayor's Commission on Youth to create summer employment, and it used to talk to us all about, okay, we're going to work hard, we're'",
        "'speaker_8': 'going to clean this up, but then we're going to play hard too. So we got to have the balance in life and understand that if you give, you get back as well. Those were the key lessons that were being taught to each and every one of us in the family and in the community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Then he decided at one point that he could do so much more if he was elected to the city council. And as my brother mentioned, he was elected in 1975 and served 12 years on the Denver City Council.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Channel nine News did a story talking about Barnum, and they said Barnum features a heavy Hispanic influence both in business and presidency. Denver's first Hispanic City Council representative Sam Santos, elected in 1975, represents District three, which includes Barnum and Barnum West.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'He served for three terms, and this is really the most important points of nine news story. He was a preeminent leader in building relations between the white and Hispanic communities. If you remember the early seventies, it was a time of turmoil.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'There was not a lot of people who are willing to step into that void to create commonality among people. My father was one of the first. So we come to the legacy and the legacy of the things not only that he did then what he taught his children and what was touch of the rest of the community'",
        "'speaker_8': '. So these things wouldn't stop when he passed away, but his work would continue on. And so I'm looking forward to hearing from my brother Dan, who will share a little bit more about those things. Thank you very much.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'It's important for us to do this because as Tim talked about, there's a few things that our father left for us in terms of legacy and the legacy and volunteerism is one of them. He believed and so do we, that if we find our community's brightest and best volunteers, if we hold them up and say, look at'",

        "'speaker_0': 'Organization does a great job of doing just that. We recognize high school seniors that perform hundreds of hours of volunteer work throughout the year. We believe that those high school seniors are leaders today. We believe that they're going to be leaders in college.'",

In addition, you'll see some leaders from from our community the governor, the mayor, the honorable councilman Paul. We've seen Mr. Flynn the past couple of years.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I want to thank Mr. Espinosa and Debbie, because these people have supported us forever. So when you look at that picture, guys, I want you to see what I want you to look at, what you're really seeing. What you really see is Denver.'",

        "'speaker_0': 'That's 25,000 meals multiplied over 40 plus years. It's a tremendous effort.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we're very proud of it. And we know that this.'",

        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, my kids have already said just about everything. What else can you say? But Sam Sanders was in the military at age 14, like the kids said. And they didn't say that when he was in the military and was a paratrooper, he jumped into the back of enemy lines and was frozen from the hips down.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he spent over a year in Fort Carson Hospital recovering from those injuries. So anyway, the funny thing was he finally was able to get a bus and come to Denver to see his mom and one of the neighbors seen him out there and decided that he must be a draft dodger because he had to be at'",
        "'speaker_4': 'least 18 by then. And so he must be a draft dodger. So they called the Department of the Army. And so here they came in their big car. And how surprised they were to see Sam Sanders standing there in uniform and on crutches, they were a little embarrassed because people, you know, are really eager to say bad'",
        "'speaker_4': 'things. Now. Sam was. He wasn't a saint, but I kind of think he was. I go to Mass every morning at 630, and the other morning there was a little old lady, a little older than me. Nobody's older than me.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But anyway, her and her daughter were coming across a lot, going into the church. And so she came and started hugging me and talking in Spanish. And I heard her say something about Santos. Well, I knew I wasn't a saint, so she must be talking about Sam.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, her daughter came and said, You have to forgive my mom, but she thinks that your husband is a saint as well. I kind of do, too. But anyway, he had saved her house at one time. And all of the things the many things that he did.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He did so much for so many people, such as I don't know. He was I think he was a great city councilman. And I think that he probably was a saint. But over our years, we we were very poor.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I mean, he made 21,000 a year. You guys make a lot more than that. But he made 21,000 a year and paid his own aid. He was the first one to do that. But we didn't have a whole lot of money, so everybody had to participate.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I am so thankful for my children. You can see what great people they are. Pat isn't here tonight, but he took over the Christmas basket program when Sam died and and Dan took over the Hispanic annual salute where we give scholarships to many young children.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you should hear the things that they say. They're so appreciative of help. So and then a lot of things happened over the years. And a priest we know and I thought he was a friend. I'm not sure now, but he came by my store one day and he said, Ethel, I just dropped off two Mexican boys'",
        "'speaker_4': 'aged 17 at your house, and they don't speak a word of English. I said, Father, I may have to kill you. I said, Sam's in Washington, and I don't speak a word of English. He says, you'll you'll think of something.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Well, of course we did. We always thought of something because we were survivors. And I can't thank my children enough. You know, little kids, they. They took these guys aside and explained what we were having for dinner and and all of that.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so it was just just a wonderful thing. And then after Sam and I were married, I don't know, a couple of years and still poor, I had my my diamond ring for a down payment on a house, and I went and done all the paperwork on the house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And on Saturday, we were to do the closing. So we went for the closing. And of course, Sam worked construction then, and he worked without a shirt and he was brown is a very and so when we went in the office, this great big guy stood up and he said, We can't sell you that house.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I said, Why not? I gave you the money for my ring. He said, Well, because it's a restricted area and we don't sell to Mexicans. I said, Well, but he's half Greek and I'm Irish. And he said, I don't care.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'He still have Mexican. That was the first time I'd seen my husband cry. We both sat down on the curb and cried our hearts out. But we finally got to know their house, so it was even better. So it all worked out all right.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'We went through lots of lots of trials. Sam was well, he was a volunteer from the heart. And like Joanne told you that he'd call you any time of the day or night because he needed help with this.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And he worked on both sides of the aisle with the different city council. And then we got to be friends with all of them. After 12 years, of course. So anyway, I appreciate you listening to us and to our stories and thank Paul for following her by harassing him.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And of course, Debbie. We loved Debbie. And I know that Happy Haines is part of my family. Has always been. She just so wonderful. And then we adopted Kevin Flynn because he is my new councilman and we're happy and pleased.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And I want to thank all my children for doing what they've done to support me. Sam died way too young. He was 60 years old, and so he died way too young. And he hadn't finished all the projects that he had started.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'I guess that's why you have children to finish the projects that you never had time to finish. Thank you so much for your concern. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of the Council? Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I sort of just having to ask, can Dan and Tim or whoever come up and just say where you can find out more information about both charities if you want to donate or support in any other way?'",
        "'speaker_8': 'You're very kind. And one thing we'd like to point out, thank you for the request, Councilman Espinoza. Both of these organizations are 100% volunteer, and we raise all the money for those ourselves or with our volunteers. So there's not a penny of contribution coming from any other nonprofit or other organization or source that set down one.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And we depend on volunteers, 700 plus volunteers for the basket program alone. So it's a tremendous outreach. We. WW W Sam Sanders Christmas Basket program dot org and WW W Hispanic Annual Salute. Georgie And both those websites are operational all the time and we take contributions forever year round.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So if you know anybody right now and I would add one other thing, we participate in Cinco de Mayo, September 16th, selling sodas and beverages to generate revenue for our scholarships and our Christmas basket program. We do that every year.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So thank you for more volunteers. Please volunteer. Yeah. The if you want to be humbled. Look at the kids that received these scholarships. They really all make you feel like you're not doing enough. But so thank you for both organizations.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And I'm glad that the Sam Sanders Christmas baskets are are based in district one and continue to be and and looking forward to being there this last Saturday before Christmas. I'll see you guys there.'",

You know, when when I think of, you know, I made my comments to Councilman Santos and his family and in the park, but I'll wrap both up and the excellent time that we have here that you're'",

        "'speaker_3': 'But it doesn't surprise me. To hear the story and it messes with my heart every single time. And tears rushed to my face. To think of the fact that Councilman Santos was turned down. Because of him being Mexican.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it hurts because I know that that's still happens. I know that it's still happens. I know what that feels like. And it happened to me as a councilman. It. Is happening to people all over our city. And you look at the national politics and when you happen to catch the convention or some of the comments that'",
        "'speaker_3': 'that Mr. Trump is saying, you would think that a mexican is a very horrible thing to be. And they're doing a very good job of scaring the heck out of everybody of us. But what is there to really be afraid of?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Mm hmm. The fact that you want to improve the neighborhoods we live in or represent them and represent them with integrity, represent them with. With courage. And yes, with great because these are the politicians. These are the leaders that had grit.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'They weren't afraid to roll up their sleeves and make it happen. But most of all, with love. And you know, this this March, Debbie and I kind of looked at each other, and I did this with one of the Sanders, uh, men, the one where the counselor was leading this march.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Apparently, Che Guevara was in there and talking with him. There's a guy in a beret, had long hair look like Che Guevara. And very rarely do I ever I will quote because I think it's a very important quote in saying that a true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'At the at the risk of seeming ridiculous. The true revolution revolutionaries guided by great feelings of love. And that is what the Santos family is about. That's what Councilman Santos was about. There are some people in our community, in our world that draw these circles around themselves.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And there are some that draw their circles around themselves, in their family. And then there are others who draw a huge circle. And in that is their entire people. Their entire world. And that's the kind of person that Councilman Santos was.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And, you know, I. Councilman Santos was born in the same time my grandfather was. They both served in the Army together and probably maybe ran into each other. But my grandfather was from old northern Colorado. And, you know, there are some of us who.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'For whatever reason, the father role was played by somebody other than the father. And for a lot of these kids and a lot of the folks and to know that 14 foster children in and out of 40 years.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The dedication and the love. You have to have to be able to do that to raise them. To shape them. You're basically raising a community. And what a better what a more better opportunity than this park, which he helped create.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And like Ruth dryly, I like Ruthie. We had nothing. There was nothing. There wasn't a park to be played in. And they made it. They turn a goal, a turn, a gulch filled with tires and shopping carts and muskrats and crawdads.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'To this day, I cannot eat crawdads. You know the crayfish? I can. They just look the same. And I've named all of them. And you're not supposed to name them, but. They made it happen and we are continuing to do that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And yes, it's sad that that Councilman Santos could not see that some of his project projects complete are completed. But guess what? They are being completed this last week here on this dais, we implemented the Westwood Neighborhood Plan, the first one since Councilman Martinez and Sam Santos, and they worked on it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'The first one since the now 30 years. For the first time in 30 years, we've had three new parks open up in the district. The first time in 30 years was Ali's councilman Santos, with a scourge of his own.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'He wanted them paved simply not with diamonds or concrete, but with asphalt. There paved those streets for the first time. Every single street and that district is paved right and one right in front. That's right. Every single one of them.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's those things that build communities. These are community builders that we are honoring. These are city builders that we are honoring. And, you know, it's not when people say they're proud of Denver, it's not with a sense of nativism that it's mine and not yours, because that's very dangerous.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That line of thinking is very dangerous. But it is. It's this neighborhood for everybody. Right. And it's a sense of of of selflessness and to to say, you know, there's this protection of Denver and the what makes us this is it's our roots.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's these stories. It's it's these these legacies. And that's the reason for these two naming. And the reason that we're renaming and Barnum North to Sam Sanders Park. Right, because these kids who are playing on this ball field, these adults who are playing on these ball fields, these teams that are playing on these ball fields.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Owe it to folks like Senator Sanders and the fact that you have so many kids now benefit benefiting from scholarships. You have one kid who remembers a Christmas basket coming to his door because they were too poor to afford it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'That was me. We were in that program, we were on that list. And then to be able to give back, I played on that playground. As a matter of fact, the first time I chipped a tooth was on this playground.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And that's when when playgrounds were fun because they were a little bit dangerous. All right. And it was actually the street where I chipped it right in front of it. But that's where we would play. That's where my daughter played.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And the reason why we are working the way we do, we never forgot. We never forgot the ask of of a Lucille drilling when she came and said, can you please name this park? Can you can you do that in my honor, I ask you very humbly, she said.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'There's no other flowers that would make me happier in this world. And when Ethel Sanders script on when we sat down says, you know, we have to do something about that, golly, you you have to remember this. You cannot let this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Fall by the wayside. We've wanted it for so many years. We wanted to honor him in so many different ways and to see all these kids playing here, we have to do something and it's being done. And tonight we will have two new names was shiny signs on those parks will not tonight, but we will install them'",
        "'speaker_3': '. I wanted to thank those family members. Thank you to the Santos's for your work, for your dedication, for your volunteerism, for your grandchildren, your kids, everything that you do for our community. And thank you to the drilling families.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you both families for for lending your matriarch and your patriarch to not only just father, your families and mother, your families, but also to do that for our communities. It is a heck of a sacrifice. And families don't understand when a lot of people don't understand that, it really impacts the family.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And it's hard. It's very hard. But at the end of the day, those circles are drawn around so many people and we have to understand that. So on on our behalf and on behalf of the City Council, District three, thank you.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you for that time away from you and with us. We appreciate it. And thank you to Parks and Rec. Right. Yolanda Quesada, who all of a sudden who had this huge workload. And we just came to her with a bunch of, hey, we want to rename a couple of parks or what?'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Yeah. Tell us how many signatures all about a lot of them or we're going to bring twice that many right and happy hands. Right. And we came to Happy Hands and Scott Gilmore, he's not here, but Scott really understood.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'And he said, okay, if you do the work, great. And you know, right away the Dukes go up, protection goes up because the last few park renaming have been highly controversial. Right. In the fact that we don't have any single islands, a country, we couldn't find one person who was and against against this.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Right. And thank you to my staff, Adriana and his suits. You worked your souls to the to the ground to make this happen for our community. And, you know, on my behalf, right when we were out here organizing, pulling companies, clipboards out, it doesn't happen automatically.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It happens with grit and it happens with that with those souls on your feet. So thank you. Thank you, everybody. And thank you to my colleagues. I am asking you humbly, on behalf of my district to pass this so we can.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Give something for kids to see. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you, Mr. President. This is this is really a West Side kind of nightlight, isn't it? The West Side. This is great. This is great because at one time it wasn't so easy to get to and from the west side over to town limit.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I remember when I when I first came to Denver, the Colfax Viaduct was still one way you could get out of the west side, but you couldn't get back. Right. They closed off Third Avenue. You couldn't get across Third Avenue anymore.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'When the Valley Highway went in Sixth Avenue ended. Kind of kind of came around the rim of the of the of the hillside there. And you had to come into town on eight on the old eighth Avenue Viaduct.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Right on the old. And that's before the freeway went in. And so it's much easier to get to and from the West Side anymore. And so it's great to see to remarkable people from the west side being recognized.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'I thank you, Councilman Lopez, for bringing that forward, Ethel. I first met Sam sitting over at that table when I was covering city council meetings as a reporter for the News, Rocky Mountain News. And Sam was sitting, I think, at the site at the time he was sitting on that side.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'But so he had a sit with Paul Swan and John Silkier and people like that. And that's where I first heard, where I first learned about the culture of this body, about the customs, about the processes, about the practices and the issues, and seeing men like Sam and women like Cathy Reynolds and Cathy Donahue and others who'",
        "'speaker_7': 'came on board around that same era. In 1975, in fact, the two Cathy's were elected in the same election as Sam, weren't they? I learned so much about how this body functions from seeing that that group of people and and to have you, Ethel, come to me a little over two years ago and suggested that I run'",
        "'speaker_7': 'for office. What were you thinking? But I just want to tell you that it's. It was an honor to know Sam and to learn something about the about this body from watching him, watching him reach out to people like my predecessor, Ted Hackworth, and how even though as different as night and day in their politics, they could'",
        "'speaker_7': 'find ways to work together to accomplish what was right for Southwest Denver and to do good things together. And and I learned a lot of lessons from that. So I just want to say I feel that Harriet and I very much value your friendship and your support.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'And we love you. And it's a pleasure on behalf of the the residents of District two, of which you are now one that moved down to Brentwood. It's a pleasure for me to honor your husband this way and to Tim and Dan and the rest of the family.'",
        "'speaker_7': 'Thank you very much for. For lending your your husband and your father to this city's betterment of its civic life. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you, Mr. President. I first want to thank Councilman Lopez and his staff for the work they did in bringing this forward and all of you who participated in helping to circulate the petitions. I did not know Ruth driving, but I want to congratulate the family in having the park named after her.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Clearly.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'She left her mark in this city and touched the lives of a lot of people. I had the benefit of knowing Sam and working for Sal Carpio, who was the councilman that got elected at the same time that Sam did.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And the two of them tag teamed on so many things, along with Bill Roberts, who have you Haines worked with. And I think we all learn from the best. You know, we learned what it was to truly be a grassroots leader, to mobilize your community, to get things done.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And folks here don't know this, but our community development funds the block grant dollars. We get used to be administered by a group called the Mayor's Advisory Committee, and each council person had an appointee and Sam and Cell and Bill Roberts tag team to make sure that all the projects in their districts always got taken care of'",
        "'speaker_9': '. Because, you know, the HUD criteria was you had to address slum and blight and you had to serve low income communities. And that was these districts, right? So they were notorious for tying up all of those dollars to take care of so many projects in these neighborhoods, whether it was trying to get, you know, alleys paved or'",
        "'speaker_9': ', you know, sidewalks in some neighborhoods or in some cases it was a rec center or parks. But they really did an outstanding job in representing our community and. I just love Sam. I mean, he was just an incredible human being.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'That. And you're right. I thought he he did die way too young because. I can remember when he was in the hospital one time. He was actually took his paperwork with them and he was working from his hospital bed trying to take care of constituent complaints.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Right. That's the dedication that Sam Sanders had in really trying to just always go the extra mile in representing the people that elected him. I had the benefit of serving with Tim, who then later stepped into his dad shoes and continued that legacy and the contributions that your entire family has made to this city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know there are so many people that are so grateful. And if you have never been to volunteer at the Christmas Basket program, it is such an organized machine that really has you show up as a volunteer and there's a role for you.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And everything runs like clockwork. And it's it's amazing whether you're there to package the baskets or go deliver the baskets to the families. It's all very nailed down in terms of providing efficiency to the people who are there to volunteer and to get the product out to the families who who are in need.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I know that that program started out serving the West Side, but it serves the entire city and county of Denver now. And so, you know, I know people all across this city are grateful not only for that program, but also for the scholarship program that has been in place for for all these years.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I can remember Sal and Sam also working very, very closely with our state legislators, Ruben Valdez, George Sandoval, Don Sandoval, Rich Castro. They would strategize on how to tie up both state and city dollars to address needs in the community, whether it was, you know, work on Eighth Avenue or I-25.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'They were working very closely together to make sure that, you know, the projects coming in were going to benefit the neighborhoods. And I just am. Honored to be a supporter of this park naming tonight because Sam really gave his life to this city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And I am grateful to the family for knowing the time it took away from you all. For him to be able to serve not only the constituents of District three, but the city as a whole, because when we sit up here on this dais, we vote on issues that deal with neighborhoods all across the city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And Sam was always very thoughtful. He was a good listener to the people who came here that were asking for support of whether it was a rezoning or something else. But he was just an incredible individual, and I'm just very blessed to have known him.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'So I will be absolutely supporting this tonight. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Gilmore.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. You know, certain folks in the city, when somebody says their name, it's with great reverence and you know that they were a great person and they did amazing things. And, you know, you try to try to figure out and learn a little bit more about them.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'But I have to say, it was amazing when, you know, kind of looking through the information and that he was the son of a Greek coal miner and a Hispanic mother. My grandfather was born of a Greek goat farmer and a Hispanic mother.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And so just immediately having that connection and understanding and you talking about your family and about your dad and your husband and how I can only imagine that your home was very, very loud and full of great food and fun and people, and that when you're doing your life's work, it just becomes part of your life.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'And you really showed that tonight in sharing that information. And I just wanted to congratulate you on the naming of this park and and the other family as well, because what two great, great, amazing people. I'm honored to support this tonight.'",
        "'speaker_4': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Cashman.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem. This has been a bit difficult for me. It's been an extremely emotional presentations, and it started early on. Mr. President, when you read the bill title and when you got to the part of naming Emil Sam Sandoz Park, I saw Tim's eyes get big and kind of choked up a minute.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And and I get that. And because, you know, I grew up with the drillings and with the Santos family, except I grew up in New Jersey, and it wasn't the drillings in the sand, it was Mr. and Mrs. Briggs, and it was the ED Acts.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And we didn't have a vice president or star football player at the House. But, you know, the cops were always there and the fire department guys, firefighters and you know, the mayor was my next door neighbor and it was all about community.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'And I loved when Happy started things off by saying that, you know, what you learned from Mr. Santos was not necessarily the most important thing being how to run a city government, but how to create community. And, you know, I'm thinking of our fire chief, Charlie Schilling, you know, who has a fire station in my home town'",
        "'speaker_8': 'named after him. And, you know, the Mr. Briggs has a Little League baseball field. And so when it's it matters to be a Santos or drilling because the stuff that your father and your mother and grandmother brought to the table, you carry with you, you know.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'So when I got out of college, I spent a few years doing what I thought I was supposed to do in the world of of business, you know, worked for for a couple of corporations. And then I got out on my own and the places I ended up.'",
        "'speaker_8': 'I ended up because of how I was raised and who was around me and hearing the things your family is doing and hearing the effect of your relatives on all of you. There will probably be a long, long time before, if ever before, there's no one walking the earth who hasn't been affected by Ruth drilling or Sam'",
        "'speaker_8': 'Sanders. So, Councilman, thank you very much for bringing this forward. And as my colleague said earlier, this is why this is worth the price of admission. Thank you very much.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Councilman. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm sorry. I wanted to ask. I didn't get to it. And you intended to do Councilman Santos, but I want to. I'll do this for you. Came up to me, and I wanted to ask those who are in favor to name that didn't speak or spoke.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'If you're in favor of the park renaming for Sam Sanders to please stand. Thank you. And so I wanted to do that on his behalf, and I forgot to do that. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'I'm going to be totally off the subject. But since we're talking about history and she might be watching. Um, Susan Barnes guilt. I found your portfolio here. There's a letter in here to Debbie Ortega in Happy Haynes, among other council members.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'District nine, District 11. So Susan is here. I could pick it up at District one office from 1996 as a 20 year old piece of case that's been hiding between novels in my desk.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'You're not making any fans in that room with that.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'All right, Councilman Espinosa, thank you. Councilman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'I just wanted to make one last comment, and it's it's. Why does this matter? Why does this matter that we named Parks after people in this city who have, you know, made significant contributions yet so that future generations who go to these parks, who see these names, can learn about who these people were and what they did'",
        "'speaker_9': 'for this city. And you know, how I think in both cases, both Mr. filing as well as as Councilman Santos really helped build future leaders for this city in the work that they both did. You know, they were grooming young people to get involved, to be active, and to make a difference for their own communities.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'And that's why it matters. And I think it was just important to say that. And again, I just think being able to honor both of these individuals is an important way of doing that and continuing the legacy of the contributions they made in this city.'",
        "'speaker_9': 'Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So a serious comment, actually. I didn't know Sam, but I have had the privilege of reading you all. And just based on that, he obviously must have been a terrific leader because you guys also are truly, truly committed to your community and leaders in your own right.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So the legacy to me is alive and well, just through you guys. And so I'm happy to see this park naming. Thank you.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you, Councilman. What an amazing evening to amazing people. And I just wanted to say thank you to all of you for coming out and sharing your stories and sharing these individuals with us as the city. And it's been a privilege to be a part of it, and I'll happily support this naming.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'With that, Madam Secretary, Raquel Lopez.'",
        "'speaker_6': 'I knew Ortega Black. I Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. I Gillmor. I Cashman. But can each. Mr. President, I.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results tonight. Tonight as accountable for 74 has passed. On Monday, August 22nd, Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 498, providing a moratorium prohibiting the use of the Denver zoning code preexisting small zone light parking exemption for certain projects for a period of approximately seven months'",
        "'speaker_2': ', and a required public hearing on Council Bill 541, providing for a moratorium prohibiting the approval of site development plans in the amendment of approved site development plans for construction of buildings using the garden court building form in the Denver zoning code for a period of approximately 12 months.'"
