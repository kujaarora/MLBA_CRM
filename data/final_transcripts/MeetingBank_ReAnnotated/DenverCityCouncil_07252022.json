        "'speaker_0': 'We want to respect and we want to respond to the surrounding character habitat in August and are proposing to rezone a portion of the property from PUD to E2 B to develop four duplexes for a total of eight homes that you zoned district are a two unit allowance for that duplex building form, which fits that urban edge'",
        "'speaker_0': 'context that this area is in and it's a more efficient building type to build. So one step in helping us make these homes more affordable. These homes will be three and four bedrooms in size with one dedicated off street parking space per home, as well as one reserved space and the adjacent Augusta in a parking lot.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'The additional space per home is being provided by Augusta to help alleviate some of the concerns from the neighborhood, from the neighbors about an increase in street parking along Dakota. The homes will also respond to the surrounding context by being two stories in height with pitched roofs and a mixture of siding materials.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As part of our continued dialog with the R.A., Abbott has agreed to bring the building design to the R.A. for comment prior to submitting for permit. The rezoning request also meets all the required criteria, including aligning with the goals of the 2040 comprehensive plan, such as develop housing that is affordable to residents at all income levels.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Goals and Blueprint Number 2019, such as expanding family friendly housing throughout the city. And it is consistent with the urban engineering context as outlined in Blueprint Number. I would like to thank Augustana for having this vision. I would like to thank the R.A. for being receptive and supportive of this project, and I would urge you to approve'",
        "'speaker_0': 'this rezoning. Affordable homeownership is a critical need in Denver, and this development is one small step in addressing many.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Thank you. We'll move to our Zoom platform for Heather Lafferty. Heather, if you would accept the promotion, we can bring you into the panel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Well, greetings, city council members. Thank you for allowing me to join this evening virtually. My name is Heather Lafferty and I live in Denver's first district. And I'm speaking tonight on behalf of Habitat for Humanity of Metro Denver and our project proposal in partnership with Augustana Lutheran Church.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'I know many of you have worked with Habitat or certainly familiar with our work. We have built and repaired hundreds of homes across the metro Denver area. I should say across Denver. And we continue to seek opportunities to be innovative, to find new ways to find land and to build homes so that more and more people have'",
        "'speaker_2': 'the opportunity to have a good, safe, decent and affordable place to call home. Habitat supports and advocates for policies that expand our housing affordability. And just want to take a moment to applaud City Council for the work that you have done in this arena.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'We appreciate that you are trying to find ways to help address the lack of affordable housing and support for this rezoning. Tonight is one step towards that. Not only do we think this is a great project, we think that it is a unique collaboration between a church, a neighborhood, and a nonprofit developer like Habitat to find new'",
        "'speaker_2': 'ways to create the most needed, much needed affordable housing in our community. So we hope this will serve as a model. And many of the speakers before me have talked about all of the benefits of this. So I won't repeat those, but just want to take the opportunity to say this is exactly what we need in our'",
        "'speaker_2': 'community. We're grateful for the community support. We're grateful for the the imagination that the congregation at the church has and certainly for our city council's support as we have put this forward. Encouraging quality, infill development that's consistent with neighborhoods like the Hilltop area is a great way to get housing accomplished.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So thank you for considering this rezoning tonight. And I do urge you, we always would love a unanimous yes. In support of this project. Thank you so much for your time and for your consideration.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions for members and from of counsel and council. Bill 20 2-069 for Councilwoman Ortega.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Thank you, Madam President. Libby, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. First. It looks like excess of the lead steel is primarily off of Dakota, is that correct?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yes.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. And is there any other access to the remaining part of the land off of lead steel, or will there be access off of Dakota because it looks like only part of the pad is being resolved. Right.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Yeah. So the I can show you a slide if it helps. But there is there's a street. It has a lot of it's very steep. And that's the connection that comes from lead steel. So it's like a it's a dirt road right now.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's going to be no connection there. My instinct is that when the dude like back in 97 when they did that project that was planned to be like the connection to lead still not anymore. Like the access now is going to be.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'And you can see it here. I have an image that shows where the is. So here you can see the corner. So it's this image on the right. So you can see that it's like direct access to the townhouses is going to be there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Can I just jump in for a minute to answer that question as well? So the the access from lead steel, it's only about an 11 feet wide. It's a very weird shaped parcel. It looks that way. Right. Exactly.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And and it's an incredibly steep hill. So there's and with the drainage challenges and the infrastructure that would have to be built out. There is no way to to make it make an entrance or an exit up that hill.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It has a lot to do with like flooding, water flow and stuff like that. I could get really nerdy on you, but I'll spare you. So the back. So the entrance is going to be on Dakota and Fairfax, which right now is just an ELL that ends in this empty parcel.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And then the Augusta in a parking lot is right there.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So access is then partially on this site or adjacent to it. So we're not just trying to understand that. I see my colleague has a map right now of the of the property looking at it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Corey, I don't know if you have any info on this as well.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Because part of the reason for asking the question is it looks like at some point the the remainder of the vacant land can be available for development, but access to it seems very limited from Leeds Steel and then the access from Florida sorry to Florida Dakota.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So prior to prior to something for the rezoning we submitted for concept plan and we worked with Daddy specifically on the corner of Dakota and Fairfax. And Daddy approved kind of a T intersection right there for a future entrance onto the property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So if the pad was ever to be developed, there is an entrance from Dakota and Fairfax County that.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'Okay. I see it on this graphic. Thank you, Libby. And if you get this back, happy to give it back to you. So I want you to just ask a couple of questions about how many units can be on the site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So I think the plan calls for units. And again, we keep it. So it's so duplex. We see it.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'It's okay. And then. So I think we clarified the questions of Dakota. So I think that's all I have. So I appreciate you helping me understand what that access looks like and the fact that there will continue to be opportunity for development of the remainder of the site.'",
        "'speaker_3': 'So thank you.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you. Councilmember PANITCH.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you so much. You probably said this and I missed it, but I didn't see it in the PowerPoint when I went back to look. So I'm really excited about the affordability. Is there agreement with hosts to do this as an alternative or they will just satisfy the ordinance at the time?'",
        "'speaker_2': 'How are how are we dealing with the current and or future ordinances that will be in effect when they pull the building permit?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So there's no agreement. I mean. Habitat is doing 100% affordable housing. That's because they're working with the church and they own it. But there's no good neighbor agreement. There's no.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Yeah, yeah.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'So so 100% affordable homes are exempt from the ordinance. So you're just are you playing do you want to just answer? Are you planning to just state that exemption at the time of building permit? Okay. For the record, there's a nod from the back room.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thank you. That's it.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Thank you, Councilman Flynn.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Thank you, Madam President. Fran, I'm curious to follow up on Councilwoman Ortega's questions, being a math geek myself. What is the purpose of the remnant that runs along the south side of this parcel rezoning? Because it seems to me it would have no utility at all.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'As Councilwoman Sawyer pointed out, it's a steep hill, but it's still part of the Peabody, but it looks a dead ends at a private property line, so it looks like it has no independent utility at all. Why would that not be included in the in the rezoning?'",
        "'speaker_5': 'Honestly, we have the same question. A planning board. So it's good. I'm noticing that it's very steep, as you say, it's very steep. It's not really developable. The applicant proposes an area that they want to develop, and that's the area like when you got we talked about like redeveloping the whole site.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'We talked about going all the way to south, but it didn't make sense because they just that's the area that they wanted to build the townhouses. And we looked at it and because it's so steep in the south, we figured it doesn't really matter.'",
        "'speaker_5': 'So the boat on the south is going to stay part of the rest of the beauty.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Could would someone from the church be able to answer what future plan for the rest of the PD might incorporate that little strip? Is there? Do we have an outlook for development of the rest of the property because it still is under the old PD that that is very, very highly specific and particular it is.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'So when we when we looked at the property, there is a very steep slope, I think it's about 20 feet that stretches along the further than the portion that we are rezoning. So when we looked at what we needed to rezone, the parcel of land worked without including that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'And since that feature kind of ran along the entire property, we felt like it was best to exclude it from what we were rezoning because at some future time they might be able to to redevelop that entire property.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Now, I don't want to speak for behalf of the church, but currently the property is a park. It is a privately owned park, but it is open to the public and the church has no intention of changing that.'",
        "'speaker_0': 'Use anything. All right. Thank you, gentlemen.'",
        "'speaker_1': 'Okay. Um. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council. Members of Council and Council Bill 20 20694 Council Member Sawyer.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'Thanks, Madam President. I just want to thank you guys so much. This is. It's so exciting. I'm so glad we're finally here. The first meeting that we had, or maybe was the second meeting before they filed their application was like three days before the COVID shutdown, and it looked like maybe this wasn't going to be able to'",
        "'speaker_2': 'happen after all. And there was a lot of challenges. The original hope on the site was to be able to build 20 units. And because of that, because of that crazy slope, it just can't be done. But there would be there would have to be retaining walls built in drainage.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And like I said, I can infrastructure nerd out about it for you guys, but you don't need to hear the whole story. It's a shame that it is that it is exactly that way because it is a fantastic plan.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is a fantastic location. And I wish you guys would have mentioned, but you didn't. So the Congregation of Augustana Church actually voted on what to do with the land and what and this is what they voted on.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'They wanted to develop this parcel to support families of middle income earners in our community. And I don't know how many of you are aware, but others stand to have the most incredible after school program and preschool programs.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so most of the community members around the hilltop and south to help them across more areas have been in and out of Augusta on at least 100 million times with their young kids. And so this is a really exciting opportunity for the community.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'It is consistent with the adopted plans. Absolutely. And fits all of the criteria. And I just want to acknowledge the the neighborhood association, they have been so wonderful and supportive. Of course, there are residents who had questions and concerns and they were wonderful about going out, setting up Zoom meetings, asking questions and just really getting in back'",
        "'speaker_2': 'and forth with Habitat and with Augustana to see, you know, where those pain point issues were so that they could be worked out ahead of time. Just really, really excited. I think for those of you who might have missed it, this is it could have been a 63 unit senior development.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And so it's a down zoning and that that sort of left hand section on the map that you saw where there is kind of nothing there, it looks like there's nothing there. But what's actually there is the most extraordinary, you know, park and community garden, an area that is open to the public even though it's private land'",
        "'speaker_2': '. Augustana has been just extraordinary partners to the community for many, many, many years. And I don't know if you can tell, but I am super excited for this so I can support it strongly enough. I am so grateful for your partnership and for Habitat's partnership and for all that you guys have done.'",
        "'speaker_2': 'And I just I'm so glad we're here tonight and so thrilled to get started. So let me know when we need some volunteers to get building for Habitat, because I cannot wait. I'm really, really thrilled that this is just going to be such a wonderful thing for our community.'",
